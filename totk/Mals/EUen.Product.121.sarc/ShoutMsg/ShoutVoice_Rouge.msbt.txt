Monsters have appeared outside town!
Shore up the defenses at the gates!

---
label: Talk_01
---
Enemies have emerged from the hive at the
east gate! Stop them!

---
label: Talk_02
---
Enemies are pouring out of the hive near
the north gate too! Take them out!

---
label: Talk_03
---
Enemies from the hive near the west gate!
Let's hit it with lightning!

---
label: Talk_04
---
Flying enemies from the hive at the east
gate! They're heading straight for us!

---
label: Talk_05
---
Flying enemies from the hive at the north
gate too! Wipe them out!

---
label: Talk_06
---
Now flying enemies are coming from the
west gate's hive! Time for some lightning!

---
label: Talk_07
---
The enemies won't stop coming until we
wipe out all the hives!

---
label: Talk_08
---
Clear out all the enemies left in town!

---
label: Talk_09
---
Enemies have been spotted inside town!
Did they break through the gates?

---
label: Talk_10
---
Enemies are nearing the center of town!
Prepare to attack!

---
label: Talk_11
---
Eliminate every enemy you see! We're the
last line of defense!

---
label: Talk_16
---
Yes! That hive is out of action!

---
label: Talk_17
---
All right! Another hive down!

---
label: Talk_18
---
That's the last of the hives. All we have to
do now is clear out the rest of the Gibdos.

---
label: Talk_30
---
This has to be their leader!

---
label: Talk_35
---
Be careful!

---
label: Talk_36
---
Ouch! Are you OK?

---
label: Talk_37
---
That was a big one... Are you OK?

---
label: Talk_42
---
Show me what you can do!

---
label: Talk_45
---
You'd better look after yourself!

---
label: Talk_47
---
It's summoning more Gibdos—don't let
them surround you!

---
label: Talk_51
---
No effect at all... Are our attacks working?

---
label: Talk_52
---
Normal attacks don't do much against
the Gibdos...

---
label: Talk_53
---
Ugh, there's so much sand. I can't see...
Where'd it go? Spot anything?

---
label: Talk_54
---
Maybe the strategy we used with the
other Gibdos will work here too!

---
label: Talk_59
---
Lightning worked on the others—maybe it'll
work here too!

---
label: Talk_58
---
That light... Maybe we can use it!

---
label: Info_01
---
I'll leave that area to you, Link!

---
label: Info_12
---
This thing is going to be a problem...

---
label: Info_13
---
Hey, the trap is disabled! We can get
past now!

---
label: Info_14
---
These flames make it impossible to
go further...

---
label: Info_15
---
Hey, the flames have gone out! Now we
can move ahead.

---
label: Info_17
---
What? Fireballs now? Ugh... Looks like
we're stuck again.

---
label: Info_18
---
The fireballs stopped... I'm on my way, Link!

---
label: Info_09
---
Flying enemies from the hive at the north
gate too! Don't let them overrun us!

---
label: Info_10
---
Flying enemies from the west gate's hive!
Time for a lightning strike or two!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_00
---
We've got it cornered here!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_01
---
It turned white! Does that mean it's like
the other Gibdos?

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_02
---
Nothing but sand wherever we look...
Where did it go?

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_03
---
Blasted Gibdos... They just keep coming!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_04
---
Can you do something about the hive?

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_05
---
Don't let them surround you!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_06
---
Are you OK?!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_07
---
Link!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_08
---
Now's our chance! Attack!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_09
---
It's on the ground! Let's do this, Link!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_10
---
Watch for the tornado!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_11
---
That's it! Our attacks should be
effective now!

---
label: Rouge_BossHint4_12
---
Almost there, Link! Let's finish this!

---
label: LastBattleJoin_00
---
I'm taking you down, Demon King!

---
label: LastBattleJoin_01
---
Let's take him down together, Link!
