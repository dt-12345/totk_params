Be careful!

---
label: NewText_03
---
Stay on your guard!

---
label: NewText_04
---
Are you all right?

---
label: NewText_05
---
Don't give up!

---
label: NewText_06
---
Careful!

---
label: NewText_11
---
You need to recover.

---
label: NewText_12
---
Be brave but not careless. Retreat and
recover your strength!

label: Raumi_BossHint_02
---
Maybe we can make use of the devices
around us?

---
label: Raumi_BossHint2_02
---
Don't get thrown off by how fast it moves.
Just wait until it stops, then attack!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint2_03
---
It has to stop moving to attack.
Wait for that moment...

---
label: Raumi_BossCritical_00
---
That worked!

---
label: Raumi_Description_00
---
Those devices are very dangerous.
Be careful!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint2_05
---
We won't last long at this rate. We need to
find another approach.

---
label: Raumi_BossNoDamage_02
---
This thing is quite sturdy. We keep
knocking it over, but that is all...

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_00
---
Let's go. We have to stop that construct!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_01
---
We will not be able to force our way past its
defenses. We must think of something else.

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_02
---
It's dangerous to strike the construct when
it is on guard!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_04
---
Ugh, it brought out more arms!
Be careful!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_05
---
Use the Zonai device the construct
dropped!

---
label: Raumi_BossHint4_06
---
You've almost done it, Link, but remain
ready for anything!

---
label: LastBattleJoin_00
---
We settle this now, Ganondorf!

---
label: LastBattleJoin_01
---
It's time to finish him off, Link!
