Strongest in the world...

---
label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hm!{{delay15}} That's an unusual weapon you have
there.{{delay8}} Where did you get it?

---
label: 0005
---
I made it.

---
label: 0006
---
It was a gift.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}No kidding? {{delay8}}I make weapons too. I've
been using all sorts of materials, trying to
make the {{color id="0"}}strongest weapon in the world{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}No kidding!{{delay8}} Who from? It's an excellent
piece of work.{{pageBreak}}I actually make weapons myself. I've been
using all sorts of materials, trying to make
the {{color id="0"}}strongest weapon in the world{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Tell me something. You ever heard of the
monster they call a {{color id="0"}}Lynel{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's a huge beast with a body like a horse.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You wouldn't believe how many times
I've seen someone try to {{color id="0"}}ride on a
Lynel's back{{color id="-1"}} only to go flying.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I actually spotted one of their kind
northwest of here, {{color id="0"}}near the entrance
to Tempest Gulch{{color id="-1"}}.
But I wasn't about to pick a fight with a
monster like that. Strong, agile... And did
I mention they can shoot fireballs?
The best I could do was turn tail before
it caught sight of me.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If I could only get ahold of that
{{color id="0"}}Lynel's horn{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I'm sure I could make the strongest
weapon in the world!{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}But I'm no fool. {{delay15}}I know I haven't got the
skill to take down a Lynel.{{pageBreak}}Hmph.{{delay8}} I just wish someone else would
make the weapon of my dreams and show
it to me. I'd give them a nice reward.

label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I get the sense you're a swordsman.{{delay15}}
You interested in weapons?

---
label: 0007
---
I love weapons!

---
label: 0008
---
I'm not interested.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Of course. What swordsman doesn't?
Well, you wouldn't happen to know how
to make them, would you?
I make weapons, see. I've been using all
sorts of materials, trying to make the
{{color id="0"}}strongest weapon in the world{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}A swordsman who doesn't care about
weapons? Now I've seen it all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I make weapons. I've been using all
sorts of materials, trying to make the
{{color id="0"}}strongest weapon in the world{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}So? {{delay8}}How's it going? {{delay8}}Made any new
weapons lately?

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I think with a {{color id="0"}}Lynel horn{{color id="-1"}}, you could make
the strongest weapon in the world...{{pageBreak}}But of course, you can't just charge up to
a Lynel and expect to survive.{{delay15}} You have to
be careful.
A sword's not enough on its own. You
have to be armed with knowledge too.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's why I've tried to learn all I can
about Lynels—{{delay15}}what they look like,{{delay15}} where
to find them, {{delay15}}and how to fight them.

---
label: 0014
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, I'll stop boring you. {{delay8}}But if you
happen to get your hands on a {{color id="0"}}weapon
made with Lynel horn{{color id="-1"}}, bring it my way.

---
label: 0015
---
What do they look like?

---
label: 0016
---
Where can I find them?

---
label: 0017
---
How do I fight them?

---
label: 0022
---
No, thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A Lynel is a huge, hooved beast that
walks on four legs.{{pageBreak}}There are several variations. Eyewitnesses
have reported seeing Lynels with red
manes, {{delay8}}blue manes, {{delay8}}and white manes.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I once saw one from far away. It was a
terrifying sight, I'll tell you that much.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You won't have to travel far. I saw one
just north of here, {{color id="0"}}near the entrance to
Tempest Gulch{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I didn't get a close look, but there's no
doubt that towering monster{{delay8}} was a Lynel.

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Very, very carefully! {{delay15}}Lynels have four
agile legs, but they've also got two big,
muscular arms to pummel you with.
As if that wasn't enough, they can also
fling fireballs from a distance.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Fighting them head-on is a recipe for
a very, VERY bad time.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If you {{color id="0"}}rode on its back{{color id="-1"}} though... {{delay15}}That
might be a different story.{{pageBreak}}The trick would be {{color id="0"}}hitting the Lynel's
weak spot {{color id="-1"}}so that it gets low enough for
you to climb on top.

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If there's anything else you want to hear
about Lynels, just ask. I'm an open book.{{delay15}}

I can tell you what they look like, {{delay15}}where to
find them, {{delay15}}and even how to fight them.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You want to go in prepared, rather than
relying on strength alone. That's the mark
of a true swordsman.
Ask away. I can tell you about what Lynels
look like,{{delay15}} where to find them, {{delay15}}and how to
fight them.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Practicing your sword technique is
important, but so is knowing your enemy.

That's where I come in. I can tell you
what Lynels look like, {{delay15}}where to find them,{{delay15}}
and even how to fight them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You want to know more?


I can tell you what Lynels look like,{{delay15}}

label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Didn't I just... {{delay15}}Well, no matter.{{delay15}} You can
never be too careful.

---
label: Near_02
---
No way...

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hey, that weapon you're holding!{{delay15}}
Let me see it!

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So... {{delay15}}Are you going to show me that
weapon now?

---
label: 0019
---
Sure thing!

---
label: 0020
---
No.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hm. Well, if you ever change your mind,
there's a reward in it for you.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}That's...{{delay15}} No doubt about it... {{delay8}}That's a
{{color id="0"}}weapon made with Lynel horn{{color id="-1"}}! 

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}And it's the horn of a Blue-Maned Lynel!
How'd you manage that?

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}And it's the horn of a White-Maned Lynel!
How'd you manage that?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}And it's the horn of a Silver Lynel!
How'd you manage that?

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Nice and sharp too... {{delay15}}You could slice
through anything with this baby.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That settles it. This is the strongest
weapon in the world!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm honored that I got to see such a
stunning weapon up close. Here.{{delay8}} It's the
least I owe you.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Nice and hard too... {{delay15}}You could shatter
anything with this baby.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That settles it.{{delay8}} This is the strongest
weapon in the world!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm honored that I got to see such a
stunning weapon up close. Here.{{delay8}} It's the
least I owe you.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Then again, the world's a big place.
Who knows? Maybe a stronger weapon
is out there somewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Someday I'll return the favor and show
you a weapon of my own making!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh? I can't see it too well from down
here. Mind getting off your horse?

---
label: Near_03
---
Pah. Rain.

---
label: Talk_0022

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}I'm in a hurry here, if you don't mind.
Got to get somewhere dry.
