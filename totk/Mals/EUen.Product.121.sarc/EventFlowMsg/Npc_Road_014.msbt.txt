{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hey. {{delay8}}You're an adventurer, aren't you?
You've gotta be to get out here.{{pageBreak}}I bet you've come to see the strange
creatures. {{delay8}}Or maybe all of the old ruins
around this area?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I'll tell you, this area{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}has its challenges.
The heavy rains make steady footing
hard to come by.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Still, if you wander around, you never
know what you'll find! Just don't let any
lightning...{{delay8}}find you first.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Look at that!{{delay8}} Fate brings us together
again.{{delay8}} I have a story I think you'll
appreciate.
You know Rassla Lake to the southeast?
There's a flooded cave there.{{pageBreak}}I went to it on one of our precious few
clear days, hoping to find some treasure.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}But no sooner did I arrive than it started
raining outside.{{pageBreak}}And get this—{{delay8}}the water level rose
so high that it blocked me from going
deeper inside the cave!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}In the end, I went home empty-handed.
But hey, that's what makes exploring so
fun! {{delay8}}Ha!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Some places, you can only reach on clear
days. {{delay8}}Others, only when it's raining.{{pageBreak}}In other words, adventurers don't get a
day off! {{color id="0"}}{{delay15}}{{color id="-1"}}This area always has something
to entice us!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}You're gonna get drenched standing
there, bud!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}As you can see, it's usually raining here.
{{delay8}}And sometimes I'll be going about my
business when suddenly...{{delay8}} Bzzt... {{delay8}}Bzzt...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}{{size value="125"}}BANG!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}A bolt of lightning lands right near me!{{delay8}}
Or I'll be exploring on a crystal clear day
and all of a sudden... {{delay8}}Drip... {{delay8}}Drop...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...Drip. {{delay8}}You probably thought I was going
to shout again, huh?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Anyway, it rains and the water level rises,
and sometimes it blocks my path home.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So if you're gonna hang around here,
just know the rain and lightning aren't
your friends!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What are you doing? {{delay8}}The lightning here is
not to be messed with!{{pageBreak}}I'm going find a {{color id="0"}}roof to hide under{{color id="-1"}}, since
I've got a brain between my ears.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hey, you!{{delay8}} You're not carrying anything
that's made of metal, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Unless you've got lightning-proof clothes,
that's a recipe for what I'll euphemistically
call {{delay8}}a bad time.{{pageBreak}}The rain can be your friend. Rising water
levels help you get to some hard-to-reach
places. But be careful, or... {{delay8}}Bzzt... {{delay8}}Bzzt...{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}{{size value="125"}}BANG!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}...The lightning here doesn't mess around.
