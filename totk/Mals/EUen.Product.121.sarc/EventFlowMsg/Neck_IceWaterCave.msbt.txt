Now how do I get food?

---
label: Talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What a disaster. I came all this way to
scrounge mushrooms, and now this.{{pageBreak}}I'll never get to the deep parts of the
cave with a messed-up wing.

---
label: 0001
---
Cave?

---
label: 0002
---
Where's Tulin?

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="0"}}Chillshrooms{{color id="-1"}} grow all over this cave,
so I figured it'd be a prime spot for
scavenging a little food.{{pageBreak}}But {{color id="0"}}cold water{{color id="-1"}} has built up in here now,
and I can't pick any chillshrooms without
crossing it.

---
label: Talk02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Ordinarily, my wings would take me right
over a little pond like this.

---
label: Talk02_02
---
{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}But I hurt my wing in a small scrap with
monsters. I don't see how I can fly over
the pond in this condition.

---
label: Talk02_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The worst part is, I was just bragging to
the folks in the village that I'd bring back
even more {{color id="0"}}chillshrooms{{color id="-1"}} than last time.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If I don't come back with at least {{color id="0"}}10{{color id="-1"}}
of them, there'll be egg on my face.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You looking for Tulin?{{pageBreak}}He's out at another {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} gathering food
with Gesane and them.{{pageBreak}}There's a {{color id="0"}}bonfire{{color id="-1"}} marking the entrance.
You'll find it eventually if you {{color id="0"}}go west
down the mountain slope{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}If you start freezing on your way there,
take a minute by the fire to warm up.

label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I came to this cave to gather {{color id="0"}}chillshrooms{{color id="-1"}}
deep inside, but the cold water pooling in
there means that's not happening.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're going in there, too, careful you
don't slip.{{pageBreak}}Fall in that {{color id="0"}}cold water{{color id="-1"}} and your muscles
might get too chilled to swim back out.

label: Talk04_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}Ughhh. {{delay8}}If I hadn't hurt my wing in a small
scrap with some monsters, I could have
crossed that pool in a few short flaps.

---
label: Talk04_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}How am I going to face the other villagers
without the {{color id="0"}}10{{color id="-1"}} chillshrooms I promised I'd
bring back?

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Is there anything else you need?

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}I'm getting nowhere with this. {{delay15}}I guess
I should go back for now and give the
others the bad news.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now, how am I going to cross that pond?

---
label: 0003
---
That sounds bad.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Feels like every cave I check has pools of
cold water building up now. {{delay8}}Probably
another effect of the blizzard.{{pageBreak}}You might want to be careful poking your
own beak in there, you know.

---
label: Talk08_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}There are still some caves where the cold
water lingers. Guess we're not totally free
from the blizzard's effects.{{pageBreak}}You might want to be careful poking your
own beak in any caves.

---
label: 0004
---
Is this enough?

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Uh... {{delay8}}You really don't mind giving me this
whole heap of mushrooms?{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Seems like you must've gone to a lot of
trouble collecting this many.{{pageBreak}}But if you're sure, then thanks a bunch!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can't just take them for free though.
Here, why don't I give you this?

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait... {{delay8}}You didn't actually cross the pond
and pick the chillshrooms, did you?!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}You weren't worried about falling into
the freezing water?{{pageBreak}}Well, gosh. That's really brave of you.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can't just take them for free though.
Here, why don't I give you this?

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Now I can make good on all my big talk!{{pageBreak}}You know, this isn't the only cave in these
mountains with pools of freezing water.
Be careful where you explore.
