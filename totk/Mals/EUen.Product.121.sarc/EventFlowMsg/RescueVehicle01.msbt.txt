Outside!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Just when I thought help was finally on
the way, it's a piddly Hylian...

{{anim type="Think_01"}}The stinkin'{{color id="0"}} track broke{{color id="-1"}}, {{delay8}}and now I'm
stuck here. 

None of the other workers even noticed.
Great. Just great.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}At this rate...


{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}I won't be able to go buy any more
marbled rock roast! This is my LAST one!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, yeah. {{delay8}}You've gotta figure out a way to
get me outta here!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It's real simple. Just let me know
when I can get in the cart, and {{color id="0"}}send
it flying{{color id="-1"}}. Done.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Oh, but you're all piddly.

---
label: Talk45

I mean, I can't exactly ask the prez
himself to do it.

label: Talk16

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Just let me know when I can get in the
cart, and {{color id="0"}}send it flyin'{{color id="-1"}}. That'll get me back
outside in a jiff.
It's easy enough. Anyone can do it.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Anyone except piddly little you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}A cart won't budge unless it's {{color id="0"}}on
the tracks{{color id="-1"}}.

I could see things gettin' real messy if ya
try movin' it when it's not on the tracks.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}My friends must not give a hoot about me
if they can't be bothered to come help me
outta here.
If I DO make it out, I'm never sharin' any
of my marbled rock roast with them.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_01"}}What if nobody comes to help? I don't

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Well...OK. I guess you know what's what.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}The outside! I escaped!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Not bad, considering how piddly you are.{{delay8}}
Want a {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast {{color id="-1"}}as a reward?

...{{delay8}}


{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Just kidding. {{delay8}}The supply is running low,
and it's precious to me, so I can't part
with it.
Instead of that, I'll give you what I picked
up in the cave.

---
label: Talk60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thank you. Now I don't have to think
about returnin' to the dust all alone.

As a reward, I'll give ya what I found back
in the cave.

---
label: Talk62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, I'd like to, but it looks like your
pouch is full.

I have this large Zonai charge for ya, so
ya might wanna make some room for it.

---
label: Talk63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You brought me all the way outside, so
I'll give ya a reward.

I've got this large Zonai charge I picked
up back in the cave. It's all yours once ya
have some room for it.

---
label: Talk64
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ya got room now? Great! Here's what I
found back in the cave.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Round here, you can't get marbled rock
roast. Just ugly, {{color id="0"}}weird vehicles{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Even I get scared!{{delay15}} If you're gonna get me
out of here, just do it already.

If you keep messing around like that,
I'm gonna get out.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Even I get scared, you know!{{delay8}} So stop

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}If I lose this cart, all that's left will be to
plop down here and wait to return to
the rock...
Please don't take it off wherever you like.

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I can't get in the cart like this. You did
this on purpose, didn't you.

---
label: Talk40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I'm not getting in when it's tilted like this.
It's too dangerous.
