Fairy Kaysa?{{pageBreak}}Unfortunately, she sealed herself away
after {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}. She hasn't come
out since.{{pageBreak}}Before that, she used to make an
appearance from time to time. She's a big
fan of music, you know. Especially flutes.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Why, when the {{color id="0"}}flutist Pyper{{color id="-1"}} came by,
she would poke her face out of her
