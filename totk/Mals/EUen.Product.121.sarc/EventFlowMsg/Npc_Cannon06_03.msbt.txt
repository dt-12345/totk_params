How strange...

label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}My apologies.{{delay15}} It looks like we have a
small problem over here.

What's going on?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}OK,{{delay8}} goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I heard that the terminal at this Skyview
Tower needed repairs,{{delay8}} so I came to fix
it. But...

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The door won't open.{{delay8}} I have no clue why.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}The door isn't locked,{{delay8}} but it won't budge,
no matter how hard I push or pull.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ah, of course I know it's a sliding door.{{delay15}}
That's what I meant. Obviously.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}I worked up an appetite getting my
brain into gear for this. {{delay15}}I bet the {{color id="0"}}nearby
caves{{color id="-1"}} would have some tasty mushrooms.

---
Caves?

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Yep.{{delay8}} There are{{color id="0"}} caves at the bottom of
the hill{{color id="-1"}}.

I used to go mushroom hunting in them
all the time while we were building
the tower.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}My apologies.{{delay15}} The door won't open for
some reason.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Huh?{{delay15}} How'd you get inside?!

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Say...{{delay8}}since you're inside, can you open
the door?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Is there anything strange near it?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wha?! {{delay8}}The door opened?!{{size value="100"}}


Could it be... {{delay15}}Did you fix it for me?!

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Wha?!{{delay8}} It opened!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}How in the world did you manage to fix it?

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Eh?!{{delay8}} I can't believe a couple of sticks
caused all this hassle.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wonder if those were in there to begin
with and just fell over somehow...{{delay8}}or if
some monster did that on purpose.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Either way, that really helped!{{delay15}} Thank you.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well...

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}The mechanisms aren't working quite
right.{{delay8}} I'll just give them a bit of oil...

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ta-da!{{delay8}}


It wasn't a big problem,{{delay8}} so a little oil
cleared it right up.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Right. {{delay8}}I'm going to hurry on ahead, so this
is goodbye!
