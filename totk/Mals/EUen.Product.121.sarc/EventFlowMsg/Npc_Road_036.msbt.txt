{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Need somethin'? {{delay15}}Maybe you noticed the
Zonai Survey Team uniform?{{pageBreak}}We do know this area pretty well, since
we've been assigned to investigate here.{{pageBreak}}Since you asked—or were about to—I'll
let you in on some exciting news.

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Go east down the road for {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
or north to get to the {{color id="0"}}Sanidin Park Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Although I personally avoid the ruins
at {{color id="0"}}night{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I've heard {{color id="0"}}skeletal horses{{color id="-1"}} show up there
after dark, and I've got no desire to find
out for myself whether it's true.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You look like a brave boy though.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I bet you're already wondering to yourself
if {{color id="0"}}skeletal horses{{color id="-1"}} are real, and if so,
whether you can ride one.

label: StartPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Sanidin Park Ruins{{color id="-1"}} is north of here on the
road. {{delay15}}Be warned though. {{color id="0"}}Skeletal horses{{color id="-1"}}
are said to {{color id="0"}}roam the ruins at night{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Why not go east to {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}
instead? Nice scenery, good people,
fewer skeletons.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Then again, you seem brave enough to
think bone horses are a draw. {{delay8}}Probably
already wondering if you can ride one.

label: StartPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Wait. Is that horse made of...{{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}bones{{color id="-1"}}?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}No! Nope! Nuh-uh! {{delay15}}I saw nothing!
Nothing at all!

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}When I asked him to ride a skeletal horse, I was
just kidding...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}These things give me the creeps.{{delay15}} I can't bring myself
to look them in the eyes.{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Keep an eye out for {{color id="0"}}chasms {{color id="-1"}}around here
so you don't fall in.{{pageBreak}}These {{color id="0"}}chasms {{color id="-1"}}are gaping holes cropping
up all over Hyrule. {{delay8}}We don't know much
about them, except that they're bad news.{{pageBreak}}We suspect that there might be a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}
at {{color id="0"}}the top of this high wall{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But how would the researchers who told
us about it have gotten up there? {{delay15}}Unless
there's another entrance...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Chasms {{color id="-1"}}are gaping holes cropping up all
over Hyrule. We're still researching them,
but we know they're dangerous.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}We suspect that there might be a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}
at {{color id="0"}}the top of this high wall{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}But how would the researchers who told

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Farther along the road to the southeast,
there's a place called the {{color id="0"}}birthplace of
Hyrule{{color id="-1"}}, but it's blocked by a high cliff.{{pageBreak}}The portcullis that might have been the
intended entrance has crumbled, so
there's no getting in anymore.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We think that if we could {{color id="0"}}climb to the top
of that castle wall{{color id="-1"}}, we'd find a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} at
the top. {{delay15}}But there's no way to be sure.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wanna share my shelter from the rain?
I've got room to spare.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Rain makes it hard to see and even harder
to climb. {{delay8}}No point in trying to do either
until the weather clears.{{pageBreak}}That's why I'm taking a little break. {{delay8}}Why
try to power through and risk getting
injured with nothing to show for it?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Been to the {{color id="0"}}Coliseum Ruins {{color id="-1"}}before?{{pageBreak}}They're opposite Outskirt Stable, inside
the rocky mountain, but I hear they're
occupied by a {{color id="0"}}big monster{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Some kind of three-headed beast that
breathes {{color id="0"}}lightning {{color id="-1"}}at you if you get close.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Sounds like a bad time to me, even if I
had lightning-proof gear. I think I'll stick
to research, thanks.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You won't catch me sticking my neck out
for my work, no sir.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You've got guts, but I still wouldn't go
near the {{color id="0"}}Coliseum Ruins {{color id="-1"}}if I were you.{{pageBreak}}There's some kind of three-headed
monster in there that spits {{color id="0"}}lightning {{color id="-1"}}at
whoever gets close.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The Coliseum Ruins are inside the rocky
mountain opposite Outskirt Stable. But
it's much safer to stay around here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}You wouldn't catch me in those ruins,
even if I had {{color id="0"}}lightning-proof gear{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I heard from my sources that there's a big
hole around here. What we call a chasm.

I'm here both to study said chasm and to
get the word out so people don't slip and
fall in.
I suspect it's at the top of that wall,
but there's no way to verify that without
climbing up there.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Not that anyone will be doing that!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That was so scary. But somehow we

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Phew. That was dangerous. I thought my
