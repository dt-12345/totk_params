{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's a little chilly...

label: Talk_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oho...{{delay15}} Might you be a traveler?


I'm camping here so I can investigate
the giant ruins that fell at the entrance to
Gerudo Canyon, just up ahead.

Giant ruins?

Gerudo Canyon?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Gerudo Canyon is a huge canyon to the
south. It leads to Gerudo Desert, where
you would find Gerudo Town.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}However, lately the days in Gerudo
Canyon have been blisteringly hot and the
nights have been absolutely freezing.
You'll collapse before long if you aren't
prepared to deal with extreme weather.

For example, I've been maintaining a
careful diet to help me deal with these
extreme temperatures.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you want to know more, chat with the
girl in that tent over there.

She should be able to answer any
questions you have.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Rubble and ruins have been falling all over
since the Upheaval, but the ruins at the
border are particularly immense.
We've set up this camp so we can carry
out a full investigation of that site.

This area has a very harsh environment,
but we make interesting discoveries
every day, so it's worth it!

label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you like the unique ruins up ahead,
you might also be interested in visiting
Kakariko Village off to the east.
The various ruins there are fascinating,
and definitely worth your time.

label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You should keep an eye out for other
investigators or travelers.

If you're going to pass through
Gerudo Canyon, you may find others
with useful information to share!

label: Talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, it's the young fellow from before.


If you have some time, you should go take
a look at the giant ruins on the border of
Gerudo Canyon. They are quite a sight!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Was there anything else?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Give me a chance to get where I am
going, all right?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We used to have a fantastic cook, Fenlin,
but she's off visiting Gerudo Town.

Now that I think about it, she should have
returned already...
