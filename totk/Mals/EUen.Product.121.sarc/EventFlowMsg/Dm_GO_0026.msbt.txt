{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm... I'm not seeing her...{{delay15}}

label: talk154

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hm?

label: talk145

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What's that {{color id="0"}}red haze{{color id="-1"}} spouting from
Death Mountain? {{delay15}}Goro...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}You don't remember, President Yunobo?


You told us the red haze is dangerous and
that we shouldn't go near it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It showed up at the same time
Hyrule Castle started floating and
the Upheaval happened.
The ground was super rumbly, and you
were worried {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}} might erupt
again, so you went to check it out.

---
label: talk148
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yeah! And when you came back from {{color id="0"}}the
mountain{{color id="-1"}}, you were wearing that mask...

label: talk149
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}{{size value="125"}}I remember now, goro!{{size value="100"}}


I saw {{color id="0"}}Princess{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Zelda{{color id="-1"}} at {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain's
crater{{color id="-1"}}. She talked to me and gave me
that mask to wear!

label: talk150
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}So...does that mean Princess Zelda lives
inside {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk153
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, she's definitely not here... Maybe if
we go {{color id="0"}}up there{{color id="-1"}}, we'll find her.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Slergo, Offrak. I'm gonna go look for
Princess Zelda. I can't be havin' you two
along, but...
I'll sort this out. I'll ask her how to get
everyone back to normal!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So wait back home for me. Everything
is gonna be A-OK!

Mountain {{color id="-1"}}to look for the princess.
