What are you doing?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa!


Hey, hey, don't interrupt! I'm busy calling
bees with my beat.

...


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Come on! {{delay15}}Don't look at me like that!


I know it's goofy, but I gotta try.


See, the conductor in the musical troupe
I play in has been a little down.

I figured I'd make him {{color id="0"}}honey crepes{{color id="-1"}}.
That should cheer our Mastro right up!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I can't get my hands on any {{color id="0"}}courser
bee honey{{color id="-1"}}. How am I supposed to make
honey crepes without the honey?
That's why I'm trying to lure some bees
with my beat.

All I need are {{color id="0"}}three combs of honey{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Someone said there are some beehives
around {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} to the north, {{color id="0"}}near
that huge hole{{color id="-1"}} that opened up.
But that hole is pretty scary. No way I'm
going anywhere near there.

---
label: 0002

I'll...leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll bet my beat can bring those bees!

---
label: Near_2000
---
{{anim type="Humming"}}Hear that beat? Beedum!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Humming"}}Badum {{delay8}}buzzum {{delay8}}beedum. {{delay15}}Yeah! Beedum{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Humming"}}Let's go!{{delay8}} Buzz buzza dum. Buzza bee
beedum. {{delay8}}Aaand...honey!{{delay15}} Hm?

---
label: Talk_2001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa! You again, huh?


This isn't a good time. I'm busy calling
bees with my beat.

...


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey!{{delay15}} I can see that look on your face.
It's messing with my flow!

Look, I get that I'm probably not gonna
bring any bees here like this.

But the conductor in a musical
troupe I play with has just been
a little down lately...
So I need three globs of {{color id="0"}}courser bee
honey{{color id="-1"}} for a surprise. How else am I
gonna get it?

---
label: Talk_2003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* I get it that this probably isn't
gonna work to bring bees here.

But I just gotta get {{color id="0"}}courser bee
honey {{color id="-1"}}somehow.

---
label: Talk_2005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I heard there are some {{color id="0"}}beehives{{color id="-1"}} around
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} to the north, {{color id="0"}}near
that huge hole{{color id="-1"}} that opened up.
But that hole is pretty scary. No way I'm
going anywhere near it.

---
label: Talk_3006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait a second!


What's that I smell? Something sweet?
Hey, maybe... In your pouch there...

---
label: 0004
---
Here, have some honey.

---
label: 0005
---
It's not that...

---
label: Talk_3007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh. But I'd know that scent anywhere.
I love that stuff...

---
label: Talk_3003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}All right!


My beat didn't reach the bees, but I
guess it got you moving!

With these, I can whip up a {{color id="0"}}honey
crepe {{color id="-1"}}for the conductor of my troupe
on the double.
Here's a little something for helping me
out. Take it. All yours!

---
label: Talk_3004

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What did you say? The {{color id="0"}}Stable Trotters{{color id="-1"}}
are back in action?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then what am I doing here? They need
me to bring the rhythm!{{pageBreak}}I don't know where they are, but if I hit
up every single stable, I'll run into them
sooner or later.{{pageBreak}}It shouldn't be long before I can offer the
troupe leader my services again!

---
label: Talk_3008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Well, until next time, if there's a next
time! See you!

---
label: Talk_3005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm gonna beat it and head back to my
band leader.

I play with a group called the {{color id="0"}}Stable
Trotters{{color id="-1"}}. We bop around from stable
to stable, sharing our tunes.
I'll bet everyone's back at our old meeting
spot, {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

It's way north over in Eldin, so I better get
a move on.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Maybe I'll see you around. Later!

---
label: Near_4000
---
Is that a drum?

---
label: Talk_4008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You hear that? It's coming from around
here somewhere. Is that...{{color id="0"}}a drum{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0006
---
I hear it!

---
label: 0007
---
I don't hear it.

---
label: Talk_4010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I am hearing that, then...{{delay15}}


Maybe it's the one I'm destined to
walk through life with, calling to me in
that way!
But it can't be... It just can't be...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wonder where it's coming from. I've
been scouting here for the source, but I
haven't found it yet.

---
label: Talk_4011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? You can't hear it? So that means
the sound I'm hearing...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Maybe it's the secret sound of the one
I'm destined to walk through life with.
Could it be so...{{delay8}}calling just to me?
I've got to find who it is!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I'll keep searching a little longer. I hear it
somewhere right around here...

---
label: Talk_4012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a little hard to hear in this rain, but
the sound is a lot like a drum...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Maybe it's the one I'm destined to walk
through life with, calling to me in this
mysterious way!
I'm sure that's it. I think so anyway.


Maybe I'll have better luck finding where
it's coming from after the rain stops.

---
label: Talk_4009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That sound...{{delay15}} I wonder if it's {{color id="0"}}the sound
of a drum{{color id="-1"}} after all.{{pageBreak}}I think I hear it getting louder or quieter
as I walk around. That could help find
where it's coming from...

---
label: Talk_4005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This rain drowned out the {{color id="0"}}sound of the
drum{{color id="-1"}} I heard earlier. I thought I could
make it out, not that far away.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll look for the source later. Better to
take shelter from the rain for now.

---
label: Talk_4006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That sound... {{delay15}}I wonder if it that really is
a {{color id="0"}}drum{{color id="-1"}} out there...{{pageBreak}}I thought it could be close, given how
loud it was, but where's it coming from?
