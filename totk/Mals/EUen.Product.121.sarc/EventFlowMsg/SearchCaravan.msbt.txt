{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Young man, please! Have you seen a
fellow with a scruffy beard around here?

---
label: talk0033

Uh...{{delay15}} Ahem.{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sorry, that was rather abrupt. But it's our
friend Ponthos. He's gone missing!

When Kara Kara Bazaar was attacked by
monsters, we ran away together, taking
shelter at the local inn.
But when I finally had my wits about me,
I realized Ponthos had disappeared.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}S-sorry, that was rather abrupt.


We're the caravan squad, a merchant
group hoping to trade in Gerudo Town.
Our friend Ponthos has, uh, disappeared.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}When Kara Kara Bazaar was attacked by
monsters, we all ran, taking refuge in
the inn.
I thought Ponthos was with us the whole
time, but when we finally caught our
breath, he was nowhere to be found.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Between the storming sands and the rush
of people, everything was a chaotic blur...

I could barely see a thing!

---
label: talk0041

But I think I caught a glimpse of {{color id="0"}}Ponthos{{color id="-1"}}
running out through the {{color id="0"}}west entrance{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: talk0010

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If we get lost in the desert, our squad's
rule is to wait for rescue in {{color id="0"}}a place that
stands out{{color id="-1"}}—like near a tall building.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But there are a lot of {{color id="0"}}sinkholes{{color id="-1"}} in this
desert, and they can really trip you up.{{pageBreak}}I don't even want to think about what
would happen if you fell in.{{pageBreak}}Our chances of finding him would be low
enough without the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, but
with it... {{delay15}}Please be OK, Ponthos.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If we're lost in the desert, our squad's
rule is to wait for rescue in {{color id="0"}}a place that
stands out{{color id="-1"}}—like near a tall building.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But with all the {{color id="0"}}sinkholes{{color id="-1"}} in this desert,
it's easy to get tripped up.{{pageBreak}}And I'd rather not find out what would
happen if I fell in one...

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You're kidding!{{delay15}} There's a cave beneath
that sinkhole?{{delay15}} And Ponthos went and got
himself stuck down there?
How are we supposed to get him out?
Those sinkholes are so dangerous—can
we even attempt a rescue mission?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well...{{delay15}}I suppose I should just be grateful
that Ponthos is relatively safe. I'll take
what good news I can get!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you for letting me know!

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I want to save Ponthos right away, of
course, but... To think he fell into a
sinkhole, of all things.
Oh, what to do...

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh, hello there, young man! Are you here
to tell me you've found Ponthos?

...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Apparently not...

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh, hello, young man! Have you come to
tell me that you've found Ponthos?

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Still no sign of Ponthos.{{pageBreak}}I could have sworn I saw him run {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}
into the desert too.{{pageBreak}}But with that big {{color id="0"}}sinkhole{{color id="-1"}} out there,
I can't help but worry.

---
label: 0000
---
Sinkhole?

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You must have seen one by now! The
places in the desert where the flow of
sand gets all swirly, like a whirlpool?
One false step into one of those and it'll
suck you right in. They're a constant
worry to travelers around here.
Rumor has it that there are actually {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}
hidden under those sinkholes...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I'm not about to investigate though.
Those things are scary.

label: 0001
---
Well, so long!

---
label: talk0021
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Kinda makes me wonder though... Could there really
be a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} under that sinkhole?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?! Ponthos got swallowed up by
a sinkhole?!{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Well, that's not good...{{delay15}} Have you told our
leader over there the bad news yet?

---
label: talk0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Agh, now what?{{delay15}} How are we supposed to
get the guy out of a sinkhole?{{pageBreak}}I wonder if that cave he's in has another
entrance somewhere...

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh, sorry. That's not for sale.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Truth be told, it's kind of a nuisance, so
I'd love to give it to you...

But its owner is {{color id="0"}}currently missing{{color id="-1"}}.


If you'd like it, how about making a deal
with him when he comes back?

---
label: talk0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Honestly, it's kinda just taking up space.
I'd love for you to take it...{{pageBreak}}But the guy it belongs to is kinda {{color id="0"}}stuck in
a cave under a sinkhole {{color id="-1"}}right now.{{pageBreak}}If he ever comes back, though, you should
definitely ask if he's willing to part with it.

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're the one who rescued Ponthos!{{pageBreak}}We've all been waiting for a chance to
thank you.{{delay8}} Please talk to the leader of
our caravan squad when you can!

I messed up...

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wha— A person?!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Whew, sorry, I never thought I'd run into
another person down here.

Fell down a sinkhole, did you?{{delay8}} So did I,
my guy!

My name's Ponthos. I'm a member of a
caravan squad.

Or I was before monsters attacked the
oasis, and I ditched my friends and ran.
That's how I wound up down here.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}I've looked all over the place, but I still
can't find an exit.

You and me might be down here for a
long, long time.

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}If only I'd stuck with the rest of the
caravan squad.

I've searched everywhere for the exit, but
I keep coming up empty. We might never
get aboveground again.

---
label: talk0026
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wha— {{delay15}}A person?!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}Wh-{{delay8}}where did you come from?


{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I thought I'd searched everywhere, but I
couldn't find a way out of this place.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}You made your own path?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You are AMAZING, my guy!{{size value="100"}}{{size value="125"}}{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh...{{delay8}} Uh, sorry for shouting.

---
label: talk0032
---
The name's Ponthos.{{delay15}} I'm a member of the
caravan squad. Or at least I was...{{pageBreak}}When the oasis we were guarding was
attacked by monsters, I ditched my pals
and ran...{{delay8}}straight into a sinkhole.

---
label: talk0007
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}No way!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I thought I heard some kinda commotion.
Look at that, we've got a path out of here!

Did you do all this, my guy?!

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}You gotta tell me, how'd you pull this off?

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh! I bet we can climb that ladder up to
the surface!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Thank you so much!


I better hurry back—I'm sure my friends
are worried sick.

Oh, but I still want to give you a proper
{{color id="0"}}reward{{color id="-1"}}. Drop by Kara Kara Bazaar when
you get a chance!

---
label: near0003

I'm so glad you're safe!

label: talk0025

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Gra ha ha! Yeah, I really owe my guy for
this one!

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}This young man saved your life! We all
owe him for that.

Though no matter how many times I hear
it, I still can't believe anyone survived
falling into a sinkhole.
As the leader of the caravan squad, allow
me to thank you for bringing Ponthos
back to us.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}And as a reward...

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}How about this orb, my guy! It has a weird
pattern on it, and it's probably rare, right?

Whatever it is, you know it's cool! Trust
me, I'm a merchant—I've got an eye for
things like this.

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I know someone in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is on the
lookout for stuff like this, so I was going
to see if they could appraise it.
But I'll let you have it, my guy!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's the rarest thing I've got, and it's all
yours. Take good care of it for me!

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I still can't believe there was a whole cave
under a sinkhole.{{pageBreak}}What a relief you and Ponthos made it
back safely!
