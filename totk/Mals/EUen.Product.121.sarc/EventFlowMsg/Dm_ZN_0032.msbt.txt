Long ago, my people, known as the Zonai, came down
from the heavens to the surface of the world. It was
said they were descendants of gods...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_001_b
---
They bore treasures from these same gods—secret
stones, capable of amplifying the abilities of those
who possessed them.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_002_b
---
Using the knowledge of the Zonai, my younger
brother, Rauru, became a great leader. He met a
young woman named Sonia, and they would wed.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_003_b
---
Rauru gifted Sonia one of the secret stones.
Together they sought to establish their kingdom.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_004_b
---
This is how the kingdom of Hyrule, with Rauru and
Sonia as its first king and queen, came to be.
The future looked bright...

label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_005_b
---
However, tragedy suddenly struck.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_006_b
---
A man of great evil emerged from the desert.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_006_c
---
The leader of the Gerudo, Ganondorf, killed Queen
Sonia and stole her secret stone.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_007_c
---
Using the secret stone, Ganondorf transformed into
the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_007_d
---
He then created swarms of monsters and attacked.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_008_b
---
Hyrule rose up to face these threats, but the evil
power driving the monsters forward was staggering.
The defenders were on the brink of defeat...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_009_b
---
Rauru then came up with a plan to turn the tide
of the war.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_010_b
---
He entrusted secret stones to warriors with
exceptional abilities. They became sages and united
in an effort to finally defeat the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_011_b
---
Rauru and the sages outnumbered the Demon King 
and should have been able to stop him.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0032_Text_012_b

However...
