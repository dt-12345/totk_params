{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With everyone making such a fuss about
those {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, I'm glad to see a young
lad like you visit my humble arrow shop.
You must be a fine archer!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} had more archers like
you, then maybe things wouldn't have
happened...like they did...

Lurelin Village?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you want to hear about my hometown,
I can talk your ear off!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} is a small fishing town on
the {{color id="0"}}southeastern coast{{color id="-1"}}.

It may be out of the way, but it has {{color id="0"}}shops
and such you'll find only there{{color id="-1"}}. Our
village is a lovely place.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But then...{{delay8}}it was seized by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}, and
everyone had to abandon the village. The
villagers are scattered all over now.
The leader of the village is desperate to
save {{color id="0"}}Lurelin{{color id="-1"}}, but...{{delay8}}who knows what'll
happen?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean to take us in
such dark directions.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}No helping it. Now then, back to work!

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You have the look of an archer, young lad.


Why, lookin' at you reminds me of my
husband. There was a time he was a
master of the bow...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now he's left the village with our former
chief. Truthfully, it's been so long since
I've seen him, I can barely recall his face.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, sorry. Look at me, goin' on and on.
Back to business.

If you find yourself short on funds, you
just sell me what you don't need. Don't
be shy, now.

Why, lookin' at you reminds me of my
husband. There was a time he was a
master of the bow...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}He recently left the village with our
former chief, though I heard he's
now returned.
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Truthfully, it's been so long since I've
seen him, I can barely recall his face.
If he is back, you'd think he'd come by...{{delay30}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, sorry. Look at me, goin' on and on.
Back to business.

By you?!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sure enough, I knew at first glance you
were a top-notch archer!

To you, Lurelin may just be a small fishing
village, but to me it'll always be my dear
hometown. I...I can't thank you enough.
The world seems just a little brighter!
I can finally breathe easy.

buying it now. You never know when we
