{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hmm. What would be a good breakfast
today? {{delay8}}I want everyone to start the day
off right, after all...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Let's see... What would be a good lunch
today? {{delay8}}Everyone relies on my cooking to
get them through the day, after all...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What should I make everyone for dinner?{{delay8}}
They're all looking forward to the meal, so
I can't disappoint them...

label: Greeting_Evening

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm... What would be good for breakfast
tomorrow, I wonder?

Breakfast helps everyone wake up in the
morning, so it needs to be good...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep_00"}}So sleepy...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}On rainy days like this, it's really
important for me to cook the perfect
meals for everyone.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh, I haven't seen you before, I don't
think... Are you here because you've
heard about me?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Well, it's all true—I'm the one in charge of
keeping the members of the researching
team healthy and happy.
And I've figured out the secret to keeping
them energized. Want to know what it is?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha, of course you do! {{delay8}}And I'll tell you!


It's all about what they eat!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}When it's hot outside, you should cook up
meals using chillshrooms. When it's cold,
substitute sunshrooms instead!
It's amazing how well the body can hold
up to high or low temperatures if you've
used the right ingredients.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Well, want to try it for yourself? I'm sure
you do! Feel free to use this pot.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be careful if you head to Gerudo Canyon.
It's not a welcoming environment and will
almost certainly tax your endurance.
If you ask me, the best way to prepare is
to bring plenty of good food with you!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Have you forgotten the secret I shared
with you? Oh, what am I going to do
with you...
I can tell you again, since I'm so helpful
and all. Want to hear it?

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Are you interested after all?


Do you want me to share the secret to
keeping everyone energized?

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, it's you! {{delay15}}Thanks to you, I was able to
safely come back here.

I really can't thank you enough.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh!{{delay15}} I have a secret trick I use to keep the
researchers here healthy and energized.
Maybe I could share that with you?
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Want to know the secret?

label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}For you to wake me up out of a deep,
restful sleep... Do you miss my cooking so
much that you can't wait until morning?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Sleep is as important as eating well, you
know. Everyone needs to sleep away the
fatigue of the day before.
How about we chat in the morning.{{delay15}}
Good night...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Awww, did Guspar and Livo really say
such nice things about my cooking?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Well, I do my absolute best to pick the
perfect ingredients for each meal. It
makes sense they would love the results!
Thanks for sharing that with me.

label: AssassinEquipment_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I have to say...


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Dressing like that to scare me isn't very
nice. You should put effort into thinking of
others if you want to be a good cook.
