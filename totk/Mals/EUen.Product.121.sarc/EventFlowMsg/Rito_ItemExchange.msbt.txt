What should I do?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, hey!{{pageBreak}}You're the one who helped Tulin save the
village. {{delay8}}We owe you big for that!

---
label: Talk00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I think we met at Tabantha Bridge Stable.
Do you remember me?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I couldn't have imagined then that you'd
be the one to save our village!

label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that the blizzard's died down, we're
stockpiling all the food and materials we
used to have in abundance.{{pageBreak}}The others are all working together to
bring supplies to the village. I'm managing
the whole process from here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Speaking of which... {{delay15}}Huck was supposed
to bring me some food, but I haven't
seen him.{{pageBreak}}He told me he'd collect food from
{{color id="0"}}Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}} in the Tabantha
Tundra, northeast of here.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I hope nothing happened to him {{color id="0"}}on his
way back to the village{{color id="-1"}}.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Ah, never mind me. {{delay15}}I was just thinking
about a friend of mine who hasn't come
back yet.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Speaking of which, Huck told me that you
kept our food safe from monsters. {{delay15}}That
was a very kind gesture.{{pageBreak}}Thanks to you, it's looking like we'll have
a little extra stocked up.

label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any
spare food you'd be willing to part with,
would you?{{pageBreak}}Our food stockpiles are looking healthier
now that the blizzard has stopped, but
they could still be better.{{pageBreak}}If you have extra food, I'd be happy to
{{color id="0"}}trade{{color id="-1"}} you for some supplies.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I could offer you, say, {{color id="0"}}10 arrows {{color id="-1"}}for{{color id="0"}}
three glowing cave fish{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}They're not
hard to find if you look in caves.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ah, so you don't have enough right now.

---
label: Talk05_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But I guess you don't have very many
right now.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If you ever do come across any spare
{{color id="0"}}glowing cave fish{{color id="-1"}}, I'll take three of them
in exchange for {{color id="0"}}arrows{{color id="-1"}} anytime.

label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ah! So you're carrying at least {{color id="0"}}three
glowing cave fish{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}Would you like to
exchange them for{{color id="0"}} 10 arrows{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0001

It's a deal.

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thank you. That really helps! Here's {{color id="0"}}10
arrows{{color id="-1"}}, as promised.

label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, yes! {{delay8}}Do you have any other spare
food on you?{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Chillfin trout {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}brightcaps {{color id="-1"}}are the little
ones' favorite foods, so we can never get
enough around here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you come across extra of either of
those, bring them to me and I'll give you
more {{color id="0"}}arrows{{color id="-1"}} in exchange.{{pageBreak}}Thanks in advance!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I see...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, if you change your mind, that offer
of food for {{color id="0"}}arrows{{color id="-1"}} is always open.

label: Near02

I'd give anything for food...

label: Talk11

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Right now we just need to secure as
much food as possible.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you can spare {{color id="0"}}three glowing cave fish{{color id="-1"}},
I'll give you {{color id="0"}}10 arrows {{color id="-1"}}in return. They're
not hard to find if you look in caves.
