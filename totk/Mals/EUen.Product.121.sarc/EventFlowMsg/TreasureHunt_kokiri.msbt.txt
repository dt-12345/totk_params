{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm... Did I do it?{{delay15}} Did I hide things
well enough?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh! Mr. Hero, is that you?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You see, I wanted to play with everyone
by making them hunt for treasure. So I hid
stuff around the Great Deku Tree!
But I want to make sure I hid things well
enough, so I need someone to test it out.
I don't want to ruin it for the Koroks, see?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I need someone to test it out and make

I'll test it!

You'll find someone!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Yay! Since it's for the other Koroks,
you're the only one who can help me
with this. So thanks!
The first two hidden treasures are{{delay15}} a
{{color id="0"}}forest dweller's sword {{color id="-1"}}and a {{color id="0"}}forest
dweller's spear{{color id="-1"}}!
I hid them up {{color id="0"}}higher than the Great Deku
Tree's face{{color id="-1"}}. If you find them, bring them
to me!

label: Talk_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Yeah... Someone, somehow...

---
label: Talk_005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}The look on your face can mean just ONE
thing. {{delay15}}You've found them, haven't you?

---
label: Talk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}AHA! You found both!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So? How was it? Was it hard?

---
label: Talk_011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}AHA! Hmmm, they look a little different
from what I hid, actually... Well, whatever!
You found them both in my book.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So, how was it? Was it hard?

---
label: 0002

It was.

---
label: 0003

Easy peasy.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It was hard, huh? Thank you, Mr. Hero!
This is useful info!

---
label: Talk_018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It was easy, huh? Well, that's no surprise
to hear—you're Mr. Hero, after all.

This is useful info for me, so thank you!

---
label: Talk_026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh yeah! You can keep what you found as
a gift.

label: Talk_019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Okey dokey! There's more than just one
simple round to this treasure hunt.

That's right! It's time for round two! Next,
find me a {{color id="0"}}forest dweller's shield{{color id="-1"}}!

It's still hidden on the Great Deku Tree,
but this time, it's {{color id="0"}}below his face{{color id="-1"}}.

It's not hidden on the ground or in his
navel! I wonder if you'll find it this
time, hmmm.

---
label: Talk_020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Aha!{{delay8}} Don't tell me, don't tell me. Your
face says it all. You found something?

---
label: Talk_007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Yippee! The forest dweller's spear!{{delay8}}
But you haven't found the forest
dweller's SWORD yet, have you?
If you find it, bring me both, please.{{delay8}}
{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}Hmmm, so this means{{delay8}} it WAS hard.{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_021

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Aha! Mr. Hero, did you find something?

label: Talk_008

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ooo! The forest dweller's sword!{{pageBreak}}Now you just gotta find the forest
dweller's spear. If you find it, bring
it to me along with the sword, please.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The two treasures you gotta find are a
{{color id="0"}}spear {{color id="-1"}}and a {{color id="0"}}sword{{color id="-1"}}.

If you find them both, bring them to
me, please.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Right now the treasures are hidden {{color id="0"}}above{{color id="-1"}}
the Great Deku Tree's {{color id="0"}}face{{color id="-1"}}.

One is hidden somewhere even higher
than here... Good luck finding it!

---
label: Talk_022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Aha! I recognize that look anywhere.

shield too!

Easy peasy.

---
label: Talk_027

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hm, hard, you say? Maybe I should
choose an easier spot, then. Thank you
for the useful info, Mr. Hero!

---
label: Talk_028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh! It...was? I wasn't expecting that...{{pageBreak}}Well then, I'm going to have to change
the hiding place before I do the treasure
hunt with everyone.
I mean, you're super good at stuff, so I
shouldn't be surprised.{{delay15}} Anyway, thank
you for the valuable info, Mr. Hero!

---
label: Talk_012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh yeah! I almost forgot. I'll give you the
forest dweller's shield you found.

Also take this as a thank-you too!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I prepared this prize in case you found
everything, which...you did!

treasure hunt the best it can be,
