Emergency shelter?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Indeed! This place was originally used by
the royal family as a safe haven in times
of need.
It's quite old, so we've been fixing it up
as we go, you see.

At this point, we've stockpiled
some supplies, and I find it to be
downright cozy!

What are you doing here?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I, Monte, have been tasked with the
illustrious duty of watching the entrance
of this renowned emergency shelter.
My tasks involve taking orders from my
superiors regarding when to open—or
SHUT—the entryway!
A noble task indeed.

ladder, ha! But I digress.

looking for her myself.
