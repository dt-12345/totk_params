My two brothers and I have started work
at YunoboCo, which is really taking off!

YunoboCo is a big company that's
single-handedly taking on mining
in Eldin.
President Yunobo, who heads up the
company, is all about making
Gorons smile.
He wants to make travelers visiting
Goron City smile too.

So the three of us have important work
to do!

I'm going to do all I can to make
President Yunobo proud.

Today President Yunobo is treating
everyone to this new stuff called
{{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}.
But it's kinda weird around here lately.
He hasn't been himself since he started
wearing that {{color id="0"}}strange mask{{color id="-1"}}.
Some of the others are acting
funny too...

But President Yunobo is being mighty
generous, treating all of us to a
fancy meal.

Mine-Cart Land has opened!


President Yunobo told the three of us to
"Make 'em smile big!"

Mine-Cart Land is making use of the
Southern Mine that's been out of
commission for a while now.
The mineral market is nearby too, which
will definitely make travelers smile from
ear to ear!
