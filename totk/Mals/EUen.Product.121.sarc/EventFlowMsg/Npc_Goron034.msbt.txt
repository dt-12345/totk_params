{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Are you a traveler?


You might not wanna go to that {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}}
over there. You probably shouldn't go to
{{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}} either.
Ever since the {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast {{color id="-1"}}showed
up, everyone's been actin' funny...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Big Bro was so happy to get into
{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}} too, but now it's like he doesn't
even care. {{delay8}}He feels like a stranger to me...

YunoboCo?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yeah, you know... The team that digs up
ore round here and sells it and stuff.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Big Bro was always feeling proud about
the growth in Goron City, saying it's all
thanks to YunoboCo.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But ever since they started selling
{{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}, the whole city's
been feeling weird...

Marbled rock roast?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}Yeah! They're the yummy rocks that
{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}} sells now. They're like...
everywhere!
You can find them in the caves around
here—kinda all over the place lately.
Everyone says they're SUPER tasty...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But they're so hard and crunchy that us
kids and elders can't eat them—our teeth
can't handle that crunch...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Not even his eyes look the same anymore.
It's like he was never my Big Bro at all...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}His eyes are normal, and HE'S normal
again too!

Back to his big dream of eating a lava
feast of {{color id="0"}}rock roast{{color id="-1"}}!

Rock roast?

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's the tastiest rock! Every Goron
everywhere loves it!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You used to be able to get it all over {{color id="0"}}in
the caves around here{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But Big Bro says that it's tricky to get to
where it's located these days.

So that's why he wants to strike it big and
find whole bunches of it!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Lava feast!


I have no idea what that even means,
but it's Big Bro's dream, so I want it
to happen!
