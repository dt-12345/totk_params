{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Lurelin Village had so many exciting
things to do and see. There was the spa,
the Lucky Treasure Shop, my restaurant...
My place was famous! Folks would say

never had before{{color id="-1"}}.
But that was all destroyed by the {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}That {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}} was my pride and joy.
If the pirates go away, I hope to see
