{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Attention, Hylian!{{delay8}} Beware the dreaded
sludge, or you will be in grave danger!

Thanks to Lady Yona and the others, we
washed much of it away, but we cannot
be certain it will not rain down again!

---
label: talk1051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}We were able to wash away much of the
sludge thanks in large part to the efforts
of Lady Yona and the others.
Still, I advise you to tread carefully. That
dreaded substance is treacherous at best.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey!

---
label: talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! Hylian! I hear you came to the
domain for some kind of investigation.

---
label: talk1057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! Hylian! It's good to see you out and
about at such an early hour!{{delay8}} I hear you
came here for some kind of investigation.

---
label: talk1058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! Hylian! It's good to see you still alert
at this late hour!{{delay8}} I hear you came to the
domain for some kind of investigation.

---
label: talk1056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}You should speak to King Dorephan. Ah,
except he is out investigating the sludge.
I do not know when he will return.

---
label: talk1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Perhaps you should hear what Lady Yona
has to say instead. She can be found at
the {{color id="0"}}infirmary {{color id="-1"}}in the back.
She is treating those who were harmed by
the sludge.

---
label: talk1052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I daresay it would be best to speak with
King Dorephan.

However, he left to investigate the sludge,
and I am unsure when he will return.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Why not see what Lady Yona has to say?
She can be found at the {{color id="0"}}infirmary {{color id="-1"}}in
the back.

---
label: talk1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! Hylian! How is the investigation
going?

---
label: talk1053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey! Hylian! {{delay8}}Whatever is the matter?{{delay8}}
You look like something is on your mind.

Where's Jiahto?

---
label: talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="0"}}Jiahto{{color id="-1"}}, the Zora historian, is investigating
the ruins at {{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}.

Toto Lake can be found on the high
ground north of the domain. But beware...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The sludge waterfall is pouring down
terribly at present, and that aside, it's a
dangerous place filled with monsters!
If you insist on going, please be careful!

---
label: 0021
---
Where's King Dorephan?

---
label: talk1034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}He went off to investigate the sludge.{{delay15}}
I assume he will be returning to the
{{color id="0"}}throne room{{color id="-1"}} shortly!

---
label: talk1060
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}throne room {{color id="-1"}}has become a play area
for the children.

It was Prince Sidon's brilliant idea to give
them somewhere safe to play.{{delay15}} Even in
these trying times, he is so thoughtful.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Their parents were quite relieved. This will
help keep them safe and healthy, {{delay8}}which
will also make Lady Yona's work easier!
The young ones are overjoyed and already
playing. {{delay8}}They have lots of energy to burn
since they have not been able to go out.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}Ledo, who was just cleaning the throne
room, had to hide in a corner to get out
of their way!

---
label: talk1061
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}There were a few who opposed at first, 
but Prince Sidon knew how beneficial it
would be. I have much to learn from him.

What's new?

---
label: talk1065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}Let me think. Recently it feels as
though everything is new...

Ah, it is perhaps worth noting that
Captain Bazz has not returned.

---
label: talk1067
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ever since he went to patrol the area near
that Skyview Tower that the Hylians built,
he has not returned.
He insisted on going out there all by
himself, as he said it was overrun by
monsters. However...

---
label: talk1066
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}There is not a monster alive that can get
the best of our Captain Bazz!

I am not worried at all! No, not one bit!

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ask me anything you please.

---
label: 0022

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Farewell! I am rooting for you!

Huzzah!

label: talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Lady Yona just announced that things
have made a turn for the better regarding
her treatment of the patients.
That means my soldier friends should be
recuperating soon. I am overjoyed!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}The domain is going to be just fine!
Yes, it certainly is!

---
label: talk1054

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh, what joy!{{delay8}} Tottika and Tie...{{delay15}}
And Capelo as well!

{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Once they have fully recovered, I must
throw them a massive welcome-home
celebration!

Lady Yona is gone as well... At times like these,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Leave the matters of the domain to me!{{delay8}}
In turn, I will leave Prince Sidon to you!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, L—{{delay8}} I mean, hello, Hylian!


{{size value="80"}}I feel...{{delay8}}it would be a bit embarrassing to start calling
you Link just all of a sudden...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{size value="100"}}Well, in any case!{{delay8}} I heard that you and
Sidon bested the {{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}sludge monster!

Wow! That is extraordinary!


I must get in on the action myself!
Yes, I must!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I hear that Gaddison found a monster fort,
so...{{delay8}}there has been some talk of trying to
clear them out!

---
label: talk1037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Gaddison was wondering what we should
do with the monster fort that has recently
surfaced. 
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}In my opinion, we should destroy it!
Do you not agree?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}However...{{delay15}} I am not certain that I will be
selected for the cleanup crew.

If only veterans attend to the battle{{delay8}}
and I protect the east bridge in place
of Gaddison...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Well, if you ask me, that is not such a
bad idea!

---
label: talk1039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The place that Gaddison is guarding to
the east is of critical importance.

There are quite a lot of monsters above
Mikau Lake and by East Reservoir Lake.

{{anim type="Think_01"}}That means there are many opportunities
to wave one's spear about, which seems
like a good fit for me.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}...{{delay8}}Hm? {{delay8}}P-pardon me?


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You mean to say that...{{delay8}}you already...{{delay8}}
defeated the monsters?{{delay15}} And all by

You...{{delay8}} YOU...{{delay8}} You really ought to boast

Everything is optimal here! {{delay8}}The sludge has
thankfully stopped falling from the sky.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}That said, {{delay8}}it is hard to believe that the

As I stand here gazing at our peaceful
