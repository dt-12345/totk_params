{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What? What do you want? I'm... I'm busy
right now, OK?

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I need to make sure the voe of my dreams hears
of my feelings for him...

But how can I properly focus the positive energy—
or put the bottles in the water—while this guy is
loitering around?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Get out of here! Scram!

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Look, I already told you I'm busy! If you
absolutely have to just stand around,
could you find somewhere else to do it?
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I need to send these bottles on their way. The voe
of my dreams must hear of my feelings...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}And you are not that voe!


Get out of here!

label: near0001

Could...could it be?

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I told you I was busy. What part of "get
out of here" is tripping...{{delay15}}you...{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wait a minute.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}That bottle! Why do you have that bottle?

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}If you've got it, that means that you must
be... {{delay15}}You have to be...

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aaah, I can't wait any longer! Tell me!
Tell me you are who I know you to be!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Wait! {{delay15}}Don't say anything yet!{{delay15}} I am not
ready for all that the outside world holds!

I still haven't mastered all the lessons
from the "Voe and You" class or the old
cooking class...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You can wait a little longer for our love to
fully bloom, can't you?{{delay15}} Of course you can!

OK! That's settled!{{delay15}} Now I need to get
cracking on all there is to do! {{delay15}}First, to
the cooking pot!

---
label: near0002
---
And just a pinch of love...

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I know in my heart that I am not ready for
all that the outside world holds!

But I also know you can wait a little longer
for our love to fully bloom!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And until that day comes, I can at least
make you a fabulous meal or two,
my darling!

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, my darling, you have the most perfect
timing! I'm experimenting with the recipe
for a creamy heart soup as we speak!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I just add a voltfruit, plus a hydromelon,
and then a little fresh milk...

Oh, and of course it wouldn't be complete
without the spiritual core of the dish, a
hearty radish. Then we stew...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you wait just a moment, it'll be ready!

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah, sorry...{{delay15}} Your bag is full, huh?{{delay8}} I guess
you can't carrry this, then.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's best when it's fresh, so I'm just going
to wait until you've got your bags all
sorted out.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, you've got your bags all sorted out?


Great! Let me just make it for you. Give
me a second...

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! Oh no! {{delay8}}Maybe {{color id="0"}}monster guts{{color id="-1"}} aren't a
great secret ingredient...

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! Oh no! {{delay8}}Maybe adding {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}} doesn't
bring as much kick as I thought...

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}But I'm sure, even when the results aren't
perfect, my darling will happily eat
anything I make for him!

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This is really packed full of my love!

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I would make this meal over and over and
over again...

But I've been having trouble getting my
hands on that one key ingredient, the
{{color id="0"}}hearty radish{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}However! {{delay8}}For you, my darling, I will
search far and wide until I find more.

Just be patient!
