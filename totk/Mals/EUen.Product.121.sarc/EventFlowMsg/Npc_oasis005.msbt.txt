{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hey, {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}... You made sure the entrance was really

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Yep! It is very much completely blocked
with a crate!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}K-keep it down! What do you think's gonna happen
if those monsters outside hear us?!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It sounds like the monsters are all gone
now, {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}.

So...{{delay8}}could you move that crate away
from the door?

---
label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, of course! {{delay8}}Sorry, let me move it now...


Easy as— Ack!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What's the matter, Perda?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? No, no, no. You know I can't lift
that myself!

Wh-what are we going to do? Customers
{{color id="0"}}won't be able to get in{{color id="-1"}} if we can't unblock
the door!

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}We barricaded the door from {{color id="0"}}the inside{{color id="-1"}}
so that the monsters couldn't get in...

But you're out until your back heals,
{{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}, and there's no way I can move
something so heavy all by myself...

---
label: talk0024
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}It's not like we got that many customers to begin
with, so maybe it's not really a big deal that the

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A-a voe...{{delay15}} But the door is blocked...{{delay15}}
How did you...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Never mind. It's our rule not to pry into
the business of our customers.

You're welcome in our shop, no matter
how you managed to make it inside.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Secret Club{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} the only
shop in town that sells clothing designed
with voe in mind.
Considering voe aren't allowed in town,
I'm sure you can understand why the
shop is a secret.
Anyway, that's how we run our business.
We're not concerned with who you are.

As an outcast myself, I appreciate
your business.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With the town so quiet right now, even I
was beginning to feel a bit lonely.

I normally enjoy alone time, but having
someone nearby lately has brought a little
peace of mind.
I wasn't sure for a while if I wanted to
hire {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}, but now I feel like I couldn't
get by without her.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} used to be a place filled
with the voices of merchants and children.

It's eerie for it to be so quiet...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't hear any of the children, so it must
be nighttime now...

label: talk0029

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even when I'm inside, I can still get a
sense of the time of day from how lively
it sounds... {{delay8}}Hmm, it must be...{{delay8}}evening.

label: talk0030

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's getting lively outside. It must be early
morning now...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's getting pretty noisy outside, huh?
That must mean it's the morning—{{delay8}}no,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Secret Club{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} a secret
place that sells clothing designed with
voe in mind.
We make it a rule not to pry into our
customers' business.

But that rule goes both ways. Please
don't ask anything more about this shop.

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I suppose I could. But I won't be paying
more than any other trader would.

---
label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You say goodbye, but it's dangerous
outside, so we've blocked the door. {{delay8}}It's
for our own safety.
I don't know how you managed to find
your way in here...

But unless you can somehow magically
pass through solid objects, it's going to
be a bit more difficult to leave.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It looks like you've cleared away our
little barricade.

I suppose that's for the best. You got past
it in the first place, so it couldn't have
been doing that much good.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When I hear your footsteps, I'll unlock
the door for you.

Please don't hesitate to make use of it in
the future.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are monsters lurking outside
though, so it's best not to linger in
the doorway.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh... Too bad.

label: Com_Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I've been here long enough that my stock

interesting items.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You've got more, haven't you?

---
label: Com_Talk_05c

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's easier to get away from the guards if
you're carrying less, right? I'll buy more
from you.

label: Com_Talk_05d

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'm so bored... Let me see what you have.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Well?{{delay8}} How many?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Right, {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}, huh... That means it'll

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Just one, huh?{{delay8}} In that case, it'll be

label: Com_Talk_55

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}You can't hold any more, right?
Fortunately for both of us, you can just
sell me something to make room.
