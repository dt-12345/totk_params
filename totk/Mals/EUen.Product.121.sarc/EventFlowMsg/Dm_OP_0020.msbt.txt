You're not hurt are you, Link?

Look at these murals...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_c
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_d

---
The written histories of the royal family...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_002_b
---
include stories of a great war fought long ago. It was
a conflict between allied tribes and someone only ever
referred to as the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_b
---
Is it possible? Do these murals depict the
same legend?

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_c

label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_d

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_b
---
This is similar to the statues we saw earlier—a Zonai.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_c
---
And these figures look like Hylians.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_d
---
This depiction certainly suggests that the Zonai
descended from the heavens.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_b
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_c
---
It is said that my ancestors—the first of Hyrule's royal
family...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_d
---
were born from a union with gods who had descended
from the heavens.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_006_b
---
These murals tell a similar story, and if they are
accurate, then the gods mentioned were the Zonai...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_007_b
---
They must have forged a relationship with the
Hylians of that time, working together to establish...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_007_c
---
the kingdom of Hyrule!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_008_b
---
This figure... He seems to be stealing something of
incredible power from the young kingdom.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_009_b
---
This all aligns with what I've read during my studies.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_009_c
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_b
---
And then this... It shows the Demon King!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_c
---
And a fierce battle against him.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_d
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_011_b
---
If the creature depicted here really does represent the
Demon King, then... 

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_012_b
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_012_c
---
Incredible!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_012_d
---
This mural must be the great war recorded in the
royal histories!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_013_b
---
This is the Imprisoning War and the events that
led up to it!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_014_b
---
Link! This is a huge discovery!

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_014_c
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_015_b
---
All right, then. Now to use this invention of Purah's.
I'm glad I didn't leave it behind.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_016_b
---
It's so easy to record. You point it and click.

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_b
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_c
---
Oh, it looks like the rest of the murals are obscured...

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_d
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_e
---


---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_018_b
---
Just what is this place?

---
label: Dm_OP_0020_Text_019_b
---
Maybe we'll find more answers farther ahead.
Link, let's keep moving deeper.
