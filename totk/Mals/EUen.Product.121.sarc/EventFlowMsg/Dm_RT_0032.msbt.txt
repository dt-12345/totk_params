{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Link! You're all right!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I worried after I heard that you had gone
missing. What happened?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}What is it? Did you still have some
business here?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Ah, so you're looking for Princess Zelda.
Sorry to tell you that I haven't heard
anything about her.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Our feathers are full dealing with a more
immediate problem.{{pageBreak}}Everyone from the village has left to
scavenge for food or to investigate the
cause of this terrible blizzard.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}And all that has been hampered by the
{{color id="0"}}sky monsters{{color id="-1"}} that seem to be everywhere.{{pageBreak}}We're spread too thin to deal with them
properly on top of everything else.{{pageBreak}}Sorry, bud. Wish I could do more for you.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Though now that I think of it...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}maybe Tulin could help.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh, right. You weren't around for it, but...{{pageBreak}}Little Tulin has developed a way with
wings that puts the adults to shame.{{pageBreak}}Even in this vicious weather, he patrols
the skies and reports all kinds of useful
information.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}His {{color id="0"}}wind-gust technique{{color id="-1"}} is something to
see. None of the rest of us can pull it off.{{pageBreak}}Even stern Teba acknowledges that
Tulin's skill is a cut above.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The kid does preen about it more than
he should, but... Well, it's worth asking
him, at least.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Last I saw him, he was with Gesane and
Laissa on a trip to find food.

I think they were on their way to
{{color id="0"}}Hebra South Summit Cave{{color id="-1"}}. That's to
the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}} from here.{{pageBreak}}The cave is {{color id="0"}}past the cliff out front {{color id="-1"}}and up
the mountain road. There should be a
{{color id="0"}}bonfire{{color id="-1"}} marking the spot.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Find the {{color id="0"}}bonfire at the mouth of the cave{{color id="-1"}},
and you'll be on your way to finding Tulin.
