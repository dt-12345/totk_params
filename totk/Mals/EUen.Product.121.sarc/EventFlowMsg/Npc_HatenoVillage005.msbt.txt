{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Hey! Hey! {{delay8}}Those aren't ready for the
harvest yet!{{pageBreak}}If you want pumpkins, you can buy them
like everyone else. They sell them at the
{{color id="0"}}general store{{color id="-1"}} by the village entrance.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious"}}Come on! I told you those aren't ready to
be harvested! The shop sells full-grown
ones, so go pester them instead.{{pageBreak}}That's the {{color id="0"}}general store{{color id="-1"}} I'm talking about,
just to the right of the village entrance.

The farmers have been lavishing these
veggies with great care. You probably
shouldn't just take one.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, are you going to water those for me?

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm pleased to see a boy your age show
an interest in farming. Hey, if you're
looking for part-time work... {{delay15}}Just kidding.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a nice thought, but it's raining right
now. You don't want to overwater crops.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But thanks for sparing some time to look
after my veggies.

This is not going well...

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Ever eaten veggies picked fresh in the
morning? They don't get more delicious
than that, I tell you!

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Our village's veggies get plenty of sun.
That's what makes them so good!

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Sky's dark... If that Mr. Sun doesn't
come out, the veggies are gonna sulk.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I tell you, there's no rest for a farmer.
Even at dusk, I gotta make my rounds
and check on the veggies.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Nice bit of rain, eh? I bet the veggies are
grateful down there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Be right there! Hang on juuust a sec!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh. I was sure you were {{color id="0"}}Mayor Reede{{color id="-1"}}
coming to talk for a bit.{{pageBreak}}Did all this "fashion" business bring you
to town too?{{pageBreak}}Before, folks came to Hateno Village for
the {{color id="0"}}veggies{{color id="-1"}}, but now they show up for
that gaudy getup {{color id="0"}}Cece {{color id="-1"}}makes.{{pageBreak}}So which are you after?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, it's you again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Before, folks came to Hateno Village for

label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Whether it's for {{color id="0"}}veggies {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}, I'm glad
people still make the trip out here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You came to town for...veggies, right?
A straight arrow. I like that.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You came to town for...Cece, right?
One of them "fashion" chasers?

---
label: Talk_22

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You came to town for... I don't rightly
recall, actually. What a mysterious kid.

The veggies.

Cece's outfits.

Neither.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Ahhh, that's what I thought! Hateno is its
veggies, after all.{{pageBreak}}I focus on growing pumpkins myself,
but there's other fields and a couple of
{{color id="0"}}farms{{color id="-1"}} up the hill too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And I s'pose nowadays we've got those
weird sculptures to gawk at too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Point is, there's plenty to check out
around our village if you take the time
to look.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ahh, makes sense. I guess she is a world-
famous "designer" or whatever.{{pageBreak}}Go up the slope farther into the village.
Cece's shop is the {{color id="0"}}tacky {{color id="-1"}}one on the {{color id="0"}}left{{color id="-1"}}
as you enter the gates.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}*sigh* Even my wife, Nikki, is gaga about
her stuff.{{pageBreak}}You see this hat I'm wearing? {{delay8}}Nikki's the
one who insisted I keep it on.{{pageBreak}}Give me a light, tough, straw hat when it
comes to working the fields any day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, but don't let the wife hear I said so!{{delay8}}
She, uh, thinks it looks good on me.

---
label: Talk_10

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you're not here for neither of those,
then...maybe you want Hateno's famous
{{color id="0"}}dye shop by the bridge{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Oh, but some folks come around looking
for the {{color id="0"}}research lab{{color id="-1"}} way atop the hill to
the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} too.

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Except I think that guy Robbie who used
to be there said he was off on some
important mission.{{pageBreak}}I think maybe he went to that new
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing {{color id="-1"}}they built in front
of Hyrule Castle?

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Anyway, what you see here is me trying
to come up with a new kind of veggie,
but I haven't had much luck so far.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Still, if I quit so soon, I'd be a poor excuse
for a farmer, wouldn't I now?

---
label: near_02

They're coming in nicely!

---
label: near_03
---
Ah, my sweet pumpkins!

---
label: near_04

I put in a good day's work.

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Maaan, thanks to you, I can stop worrying
and get back to work!{{pageBreak}}The village mayor was getting himself
worked up because the younger folk
didn't care as much about farming.{{pageBreak}}But so long as we got our {{color id="0"}}sun pumpkins{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
the future looks bright!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}If you want more of my pumpkins, you'll
find them at the {{color id="0"}}general store{{color id="-1"}} in the
center of the village.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Now that word of the new kind of veggie
we developed is getting out, Hateno's
produce is getting pretty famous!{{pageBreak}}Now when someone comes to the village,
it's a toss-up whether they're here for the
{{color id="0"}}veggies{{color id="-1"}} or for {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}'s gaudy clothes.{{pageBreak}}Say, friend...which of those do you think
will attract more people from here out?

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}This'll be the last of today's work in the
field. Tomorrow's another day of looking
after my veggies!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You gave me a jump there! {{delay8}}It's not right,
going around scaring folks.{{pageBreak}}Usually the wife would've seen you come
in, {{delay8}}but I guess Nikki is still chatting away
at the kitchen.

---
label: Talk_29

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What, again? {{delay8}}Didn't I tell you this just
isn't right? Sheesh.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I thought you might've been a ghost...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}
