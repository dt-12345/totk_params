{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It sounds like my husband is really busy
at the construction site. He won't be able
to leave for a while...
Not too long ago, he had to work late
several days in a row, and Mattison got
really upset about it.
Finally, I decided to take her to the
construction site using the {{color id="0"}}railcar{{color id="-1"}}...

She'd been so upset until that point, but
when she saw her father working hard,
she said...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}"Papa has such dedicat-son! I should
be more like him, so I'll stop crying and
be more patient!"
That was the moment, I think. {{delay15}}She saw
