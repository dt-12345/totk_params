{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's hard to believe these ruins just fell
from the sky. I mean, they're from the age
of legends, and now they're here!
It's all so strange, huh?

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, it sure is. But it's also a great
opportunity. All of us on the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey
Team {{color id="-1"}}should count ourselves lucky.
If it weren't for {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, this never
would've happened. Not that anyone
knows what the Upheaval even is...

---
label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Well, {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}}'s looking into it. She's holed
up in her {{color id="0"}}research lab{{color id="-1"}} inside the fort,
trying to make sense of things.
She figures if she better understands {{color id="0"}}the
Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, she'll find some sort of lead on
the princess.
But so far, nothing...

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Well, {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}} is investigating {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}.
She's certain it'll provide clues about
Princess Zelda.
But progress isn't great, {{delay8}}I've heard.

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Is the princess all right, wherever she is?

who cares about that at a time like this?{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It'd be great to understand more about

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Boss! Did you read in the paper that the
