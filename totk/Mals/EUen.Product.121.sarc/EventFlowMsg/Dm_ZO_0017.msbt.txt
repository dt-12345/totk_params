{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}A waterfall! A waterfall descended from
the sky!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Link, what happened? Is this your doing?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Aha!{{delay8}} So you activated a mysterious device
in the ruins...

And then the waterfall appeared...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hm...{{delay15}} Ah! I believe I understand!


To a Zora, a waterfall is no different from
a path.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}That must be the meaning behind
"watery bridge." Yes, it must!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If we climb this waterfall, we shall ascend
into the sky!

you is as well placed as ever.

label: Dm_ZO_0017_Text_020_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Is someone calling to me? What was that
sound I just heard...

---
label: Dm_ZO_0017_Text_021_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Well... In any case, we now have a
path forward. All that is left is to press
ever onward!
