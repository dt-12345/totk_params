The other geoglyphs...

label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So... Have you learned of any new
{{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}locations?

label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}We have balloons scouring the kingdom
for them, although it's hardly quick work.

Maybe we could survey more territory by
launching out of the Skyview Towers...{{delay8}}
but no, that's not safe.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hm? Oh, it's you, Link.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}We are searching in every region for
geoglyphs. Alas, they are not as easy to
find as one might expect.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Lady Impa... What would you say to a
targeted approach? Instead of looking
everywhere, we start by finding a clue.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Hmm. The {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple {{color id="-1"}}would be
best for that, I suppose.

It's in {{color id="0"}}a canyon in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}. We can only
hope it is not too dangerous there.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}For now, let us continue combing the land
for information. We need every scrap of
evidence we can find.

label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The survey team will support you however
we can. Many hands, as they say!

label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thank you.

And, Sir Link, we could use your help
as well. Please continue to search
for geoglyphs.
Or you could go to that {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}
at the bottom of {{color id="0"}}a canyon in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.
