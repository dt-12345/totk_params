{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I bet only the very best researchers from
the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}} get picked to work
on valuable sites like the Ring Ruins.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If we join the survey team, I'd want to
investigate amazing places like that!{{delay15}}
Right, Totsie?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}With all the ruins falling from the sky, the
Upheaval really hit Kakariko Village hard.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The chief was smart to take advantage
and use tourism to liven things up.{{delay15}}
Right, Totsie?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Wait, you're not Totsuna! {{delay8}}What business
do you have startling folks like that?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You wanted to see the floating Ring Ruin,
Totsie, but you fell asleep?

You're really missing out...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I heard that {{color id="0"}}stone slabs{{color id="-1"}} were found in
the other four Ring Ruins sites. I wonder
if there's one in this ring too.
What do you think is written on
them, Totsie?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hey, Totsie. Rain doesn't stop the
Zonai Survey Team from working on
their research.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So maybe we should work outside in the
rain too.{{delay15}} Maybe...{{delay15}}
