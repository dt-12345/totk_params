{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh, Sir Link!{{delay15}} Thank you ever so much for
your noble efforts.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I have been earnestly pondering what
I can possibly do to thank you for saving
the domain. However...

---
label: CreateArmor_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Sir Link!


I am overjoyed that your precious
Zora armor has at last been returned
to your care.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Just one more thing!{{delay15}} There is
something I would like to speak with
you about...

---
label: CreateArmor_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Jiahto found some ancient texts that
mention the {{color id="0"}}Zora greaves{{color id="-1"}}!

It is said that those who wear them are
gifted the power to swim in the water as
they please.
I am certain that such an item would
be invaluable in your quest to locate
Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I told Sidon and everyone in the domain
that I hope to present this special gift
to you. However...

---
label: CreateArmor_08_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The greaves in question have still not
been located.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}According to the texts Jiahto found, the
Zora greaves were created long ago...

It seems they were offered up at the
{{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora Waterworks{{color id="-1"}} as a prayer for
friendship between the Zora and Hylians.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Upon hearing that, I desperately searched
there, but I was unable to locate them.

I wonder where in the waterworks the
Zora greaves were offered...

---
label: CreateArmor_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Hm?{{delay15}} You have already found it?!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Hee-hee!{{delay15}} Oh, Sir Link, I am truly no
match for you!

---
label: CreateArmor_02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Hm?{{delay15}} Upon your feet...{{delay8}}those are the
Zora greaves, are they not?!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Hee-hee!{{delay15}} To think that after all of my
fretting, you already found them. I am
truly no match for you, Sir Link!

---
label: CreateArmor_near01
---
The Zora greaves...

---
label: CreateArmor_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh, Sir Link!{{delay15}} Thank you for stopping by!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}As it were, I have still not located the
Zora greaves...

---
label: CreateArmor_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It seems the {{color id="0"}}Zora greaves {{color id="-1"}}were offered at
the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora Waterworks{{color id="-1"}} at the
bottom of the East Reservoir Lake.
That is what the texts claim, in any case.
If that is correct, I wonder where in the
waterworks the greaves were offered...

---
label: 0000

Zora greaves?

---
label: 0001

Ancient Waterworks?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It is said that those who wear the
Zora greaves are gifted the power
to swim in the water as they please.
According to the ancient text, long ago in
the distant past...{{pageBreak}}they were offered up at the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora
Waterworks{{color id="-1"}} as a prayer for friendship
between the Zora and Hylians.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}In the same spirit, I hoped to gift them to
you as a symbol of the friendship the Zora
gratefully share with you. However...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora Waterworks{{color id="-1"}} is a ruin
at the bottom of the reservoir lake{{delay15}}
situated in the east of the domain.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sidon found it with your help, did he not?


You can freely go inside by jumping into
the whirlpool in the reservoir lake.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I was so sure the Zora greaves that
were offered long ago would be in
there. However...

---
label: CreateArmor_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I thought they would prove valuable to
you.{{delay8}} I am terribly sorry that I failed to
find those greaves for you.
I wonder if there are still places we have
yet to access within the waterworks...

---
label: CreateArmor_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, Sir Link!{{delay8}} About the Zora greaves...

---
label: CreateArmor_40_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, Sir Link!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Just a moment.{{delay8}} What is that upon your
feet? Could those be...{{delay15}}the Zora greaves?!

---
label: CreateArmor_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Wow!{{delay15}} So a large hole opened up within
the waterworks, draining the water?

And the Zora greaves were at the bottom
of that big hole. {{delay15}}Extraordinary!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}After all that my Sidon has told me,
I can safely say that it is so like you
to find them on your own, Sir Link!

---
label: CreateArmor_44_2
---
May they prove useful to you during your
noble travels.

The Zora greaves are a symbol of the
friendship between the Zora and Hylians...

As such, it is a most-fitting gift for you,
as you are truly an irreplaceable friend
to all the Zora of the domain.

---
label: CreateArmor_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Hee-hee.{{delay8}} Speaking of irreplaceable
friends...

Whenever my dear Sidon opens his
mouth, chances are it is to speak of
you, Sir Link.
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}He'll say things like, "Link is the best!"
And also, "No task is insurmountable
when I am with Link!"
I feel a bit silly telling you this, but after
all that has transpired, I truly understand
how he came to feel that way.
Sir Link... Thank you. So very much. That
he has found a true companion in you
makes me as happy as it does him.
{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Zora's Domain will always be with you,
now and forevermore. Consider that a
fervent promise.
Please do not be a stranger, dearest
friend of the domain.

label: CreateArmor_47

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Ah! This simply will not do!{{delay15}} I forgot to
tell you...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I asked {{color id="0"}}Chroma{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Khira{{color id="-1"}} to try to find
some way to assist you, Sir Link.

They are now investigating something
additional to the Zora greaves...
the {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I am certain that the helm will also prove
useful to you on your journey, Sir Link.{{delay15}}
I hope you will speak with them about it.

label: CreateArmor_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sir Link. I shall never forget all that you
have done for us Zora, not for the rest
of my days.
Please do not be a stranger to our
fair domain!
