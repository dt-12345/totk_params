Poes...

---
label: talk1022
---
Poes...

---
label: talk1000
---
You who stand before me...


I am one who returns {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}} to the afterlife
where they belong.

---
label: talk1020
---
Offer {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}} to me. They are spirits that
ought to return to the afterlife.

---
label: 1000
---
Poes?

---
label: 1001
---
Here's a Poe for you.

---
label: 1002
---
You can't have any.

---
label: talk1001
---
{{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}} are pitiful beings who have lost their
way home and wander the depths of
this land.
Good... Evil... That's the futile perspective
of narrow-minded beings. There is no
such distinction in wandering spirits.
You have already obtained {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: talk1014
---
Is that so...


Visit me again if you decide to offer {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}}.


I will grant you suitable compensation.

---
label: talk1002
---
Yes... Oh, this is indeed a {{color id="0"}}Poe{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk1003
---
Yes... Oh, this is indeed a {{color id="0"}}Poe{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}


What pitiful beings these are. They have
lost their way home, and wander the
depths of this land.

---
label: talk1004
---
...


I have returned the lost spirit to the
afterlife where it belongs.

Since I was brought here to the surface,
I have been unable to return Poes to the
afterlife.
Because of you, I can assist them once
again. You should take this.

---
label: talk1006
---
...


Have you...encountered my brethren in
the depths of the land?

Wait just a moment...

---
label: talk1024
---
I can sense the {{color id="0"}}locations of my brethren{{color id="-1"}}.


If you offer me {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="AmosStatue_WhereIsPrice1" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} Poes{{color id="-1"}}, I will tell you
{{color id="0"}}where to find one of them{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk1023
---
If you offer me more {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}}, I will give you
suitable compensation.

---
label: talk1007
---
My {{color id="0"}}brethren{{color id="-1"}}, whose spirits reside in
statues far larger than mine, are in the
depths of this land.
If you encounter my {{color id="0"}}brethren{{color id="-1"}}, try offering
Poes to them.

---
label: 1030
---
Where are they?

---
label: 1031
---
Bye.

---
label: talk1025
---
If you offer me {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="AmosStatue_WhereIsPrice1" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} Poes{{color id="-1"}}, I will tell you
the {{color id="0"}}location of one of my brethren{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 1020
---
Tell me.

---
label: 1021
---
Maybe another time.

---
label: talk1015
---
I acknowledge your offering...{{delay8}} I will tell
you of the {{color id="0"}}location of one of my brethren{{color id="-1"}}
in the depths of the land.

---
label: talk1021
---
Go to the location indicated on
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: talk1016
---
Seek out wandering spirits for my
brethren in the depths of this land.

---
label: talk1017
---
Farewell...

---
label: talk1019
---
It seems you do not have enough Poes
to offer...

---
label: talk1026
---
You appear to already know the locations
of all of my brethren...

---
label: talk1027
---
But it seems one of my brethren cannot
make use of his power.

What could this mean?

---
label: talk1011
---
You who stand before me... Offer up {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}}
so that I may return them to the afterlife.

---
label: 1010
---
I'll offer Poes.

---
label: 1011
---
Brethren location?

---
label: 1012
---
Maybe another time.

---
label: talk1008
---
Offer {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="AmosStatue_WhereIsPrice1" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} Poes{{color id="-1"}} to me... If you do,
I will tell you the {{color id="0"}}location of one of
my brethren{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk1009

Offer {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="AmosStatue_WhereIsPrice2" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} Poes{{color id="-1"}} to me... If you do,
I will tell you the {{color id="0"}}location of one of
my brethren{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk1012
---
Seek my brethren in the depths of
this land...

---
label: talk1013
---
Visit me again when you have an
abundance of wandering spirits.

---
label: talk1018
---
I no longer have anything to offer you.

---
label: Com_Talk_36
---
I no longer have anything to offer you.


Others may also be seeking spirits. Visit
my brethren in the depths of this land.
