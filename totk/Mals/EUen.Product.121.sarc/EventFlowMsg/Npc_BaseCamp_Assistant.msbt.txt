{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} you took helped me realize
this fragment here is going to help us
{{color id="0"}}see the Depths in a new way{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'll look through my collection for more
fragments, and I'll let you know if I have
a breakthrough.
Until then, focus on the investigations
that Doc asked you to do!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Now that I know fragments like this one
can help us {{color id="0"}}see the Depths in a new way{{color id="-1"}},
I'll be searching my collection for more.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'll let you know if that leads to a
new breakthrough!{{pageBreak}}Until then, you should probably focus on
the investigations that Doc tasked you
with, Swordsman!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Um, Swordsman?{{pageBreak}}That's where I keep my research

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Swordsman? Are you OK over there? 
You looked like you were somewhere
else just now.
Oh, I bet you're interested in that
strange stone, huh? {{delay15}}We discovered
it in the Depths.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It looks both naturally formed and as
though it's been carved into...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We don't know much about it, as you
can probably tell. There's still so much
to learn...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So once I'm done with my current
investigation, I plan to start digging
into it more!
