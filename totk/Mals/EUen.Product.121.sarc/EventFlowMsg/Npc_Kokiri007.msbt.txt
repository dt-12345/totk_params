{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}No matter which way I enter the Lost
Woods, the fog comes and gets me, and
then I'm right back at the beginning...
It's covering the entire woods, so there's
no way to go without the fog getting me...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't return to Korok Forest like this.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Chio told me that a monster was in the
Great Deku Tree's tummy, making trouble.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Everything seems OK now, but maybe I
should double-check around him to make
