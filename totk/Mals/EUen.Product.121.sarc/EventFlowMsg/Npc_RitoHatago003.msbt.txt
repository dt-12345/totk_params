Get a load of this orb! Seems really old
and REALLY expensive, don't you think?

I hear there's someone in Gerudo Town
who's investigating all these ancient
whatchamacallits.
So once I get into town, I'm planning on
finding somebody who knows their stuff
about this stuff!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Isn't this orb great?! I bet it's every bit
as expensive as it is old!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just can't get enough of my orb, can ya?


Well, that one's mine! If you want your
own, you're gonna have to find it yourself.

Thank you, my guy! We wouldn't be
hanging around laughing like this if you
hadn't come to save the day!
That orb over there is all yours now.
Sit on it, roll it around, do whatever you
want with it!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Apparently someone in Gerudo Town
is investigating all this neat old stuff.

That's actually why I joined the caravan
squad—to get into the town and learn
about that orb.
There's not much reason for me to be part
of it anymore, but...I did appreciate that
everyone was so worried about me.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Kinda reminds ya just how nice it is to
have friends...{{delay15}} So I think I might hang
with them for a while longer...

Honestly, getting into that town is why I
joined the caravan squad to begin with.

There's not much reason for me to be part
of it anymore, but...they all seemed really
worried about me.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}So...you know...{{delay15}} I think I might hang here
for a little while longer.

My guy! It's all thanks to you that we can
all sit around laughing like this!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The only reason I joined the caravan
squad was to get that orb appraised
in Gerudo Town.
But the orb's gone, and the soldiers don't
trust us anymore, so there's no more
reason for me to be part of the squad.
That's what I thought, until I fell into that
sinkhole and saw how worried everyone
was about me...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It feels pretty great to have friends!
