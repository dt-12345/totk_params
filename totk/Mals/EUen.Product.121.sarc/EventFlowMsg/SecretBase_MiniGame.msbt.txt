{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So you're the newcomer, huh? This is
where we train.

Zelda's disappearance robbed Hyrule of
its spirit, {{delay8}}which gives us the perfect
opportunity to bring it to its knees.
{{anim type="Think"}}The only problem is her stubborn little
"appointed swordsman," Link. We've
received reports that he still lives.
I hate to admit it, but he's a formidable
foe. {{delay8}}We'll all need to hone our skills if
we hope to take him down.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you value your life, then you should do
some training yourself.

Prove you've got what it takes...

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}and you might even earn our precious
{{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}}.

It's our sacred treasure, completely
resistant to electricity.

But because it's such a powerful piece of
armor, it can only be handled by those
who have been properly trained.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We train by sparring with our fellow Yiga.{{delay8}}
We set a timer, and the combatants just
keep coming.
You'll earn better and better {{color id="0"}}prizes{{color id="-1"}} based
on the number of opponents you defeat.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Let's see...{{delay8}} If we really want to measure
your strength...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Show me you can defeat three
combatants in under {{color id="0"}}1 minute{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, newcomer. {{delay15}}Are you here to train?


Smart. With Zelda missing, {{delay8}}now's the
perfect time to crush whoever's left.

{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I like your initiative!

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The more you train, the more you nourish
your mind and body. {{delay15}}It's always a good
idea to sharpen your skills.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Taking a look at you...{{delay8}}let's see if you
can {{color id="0"}}defeat three combatants in under
1 minute{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even without a prize on the line, your
devotion to Master Kohga has you eager
to train.
{{size value="125"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I like it!{{size value="100"}}


To reward your admirable ambition, I will
waive your training fee!{{pageBreak}}But know this—should you enter the
arena, there will be no quitting till all
is said and done.

---
label: Talk_40

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Never thought I'd see the day one of my
pupils would don that helm.{{delay15}} Now...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}To reward your admirable ambition, I will

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}On the line is our {{color id="0"}}Earthwake technique{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
capable use of which marks you as a
true member of the Yiga Clan.
Of course, to prove yourself worthy of
such a prize, you would have to defeat
six combatants... Think you're up for it?

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Will you prove yourself worthy of our
sacred treasure,{{delay8}} the {{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}It's a tremendously powerful piece of
armor. Only those who have gone through
sufficient training can handle it.
And it can be yours, if you can defeat an
unprecedented nine combatants in time.
Think you're up to the task?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've prepared {{color id="0"}}100 rupees{{color id="-1"}} for the
training fee, yes? Be warned, there will be
no quitting until the challenge is done.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The training fee is typically {{color id="0"}}100 rupees{{color id="-1"}}...
but since you're new to this, I suppose
your first round can be free.
Know that should you take this challenge,
there's no turning back. You must fight
until the time limit—or your life—expires.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Just because you're a newcomer doesn't
mean you get a discount! Come back
again when you've got some money.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Then let's start the training!{{delay15}} All hands,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Defeat three combatants, and I will give
you some {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan fabric{{color id="-1"}} as proof that
you trained with us.
Defeat six, and I will instruct you in our
secret skill—the {{color id="0"}}Earthwake technique{{color id="-1"}}!

If you somehow manage to defeat nine,
then the Yiga Clan's sacred treasure, the
{{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}}, will be yours.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...{{delay8}}Hmm.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm impressed you're still standing.{{delay15}}
You defeated three of our fighters,

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If you're this talented...you might
be an even match for that nefarious

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Take this. You've earned it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}So you're the Yiga who made blademaster
faster than anyone else in history...
This is where we mortals train.
I won't begrudge you your title, you're
clearly capable. But you're a newcomer
to my arena, and I'll treat you as such.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now,{{delay15}} newcomer,{{delay15}} Zelda's disappearance
has provided us with an opportunity to
crush Hyrule's spirit once and for all.
{{anim type="Think_01"}}But her "appointed swordsman," Link, is
still out there, alive and kicking. Stubborn
little wretch...
Hence our intensive training. He's a
formidable warrior, and we'll all need
to hone our skills to take him down.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you value your life, I recommend you do
the same, blademaster title or no.

Show enough promise...

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah.{{delay15}} You again.


I hear that you became a blademaster.
Faster than any other Yiga in history too.

{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}But in my arena, you're still a newcomer.
And don't you forget it.

---
label: Talk_19_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Came back for some more training,
didn't you?

Good. With Zelda gone, we can crush
Hyrule beneath our heel, so long as
we're all at our best.
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I'm glad to see you showing initiative!
