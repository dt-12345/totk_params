The mightiest monster...

---
label: Talk78
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Whaaafafafa! My heart goes la-la-la!
In that case, I'll ask you to make a statue
of the mightiest monster there is.
And which monster most deserves
that title? Why, of course it's...{{delay8}}
the {{color id="0"}}King Gleeok{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk79
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now, one very rarely puts eyeballs on
the King Gleeok.

But once you do, hoo-hoo! Its huge body
is covered in black scales, and its wings
go FWOOSH-FWOOSH!
A different horn grows on each of its
THREE heads.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}And when it attacks! Bow-rooowr!
Baaa-rooo! Grrroo-wow! Fearsome
is the perfect word.

---
label: Talk80
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The mightiest monster? That sounds
exciting. Of course, if I have a {{color id="0"}}detailed
picture{{color id="-1"}}, I can sculpt any ol' monster.

---
label: Talk81
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yimpee! I just knew the most powerful
monster would inspire you too!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, I, Kilton, will pour my heart
and lungs into describing it to you
however many times you need!

---
label: 0001
---
Check out this picture.

---
label: 0013
---
Which monster?

---
label: 0002
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: 0010
---
Goodbye.

label: Talk08

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hi... {{delay15}}Hiyaaah!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


Th-this is it! This is the mightiest monster
of them all—the {{color id="0"}}King Gleeok{{color id="-1"}} I've been
in search of!

---
label: Talk82
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hahayeee!{{delay8}} Th-that right there is a Gleeok,
to be sure!

But...I want a sculpture of a {{color id="0"}}King Gleeok{{color id="-1"}},
which is like a Gleeok but has different
horns sprouting from its three heads.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Of course, this Gleeok picture is delightful
too.{{delay8}} Could I borrow it?

---
label: Talk44
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Bwaaa!{{delay8}} Oh no!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I had that picture, the sculpture would
be son and done. But, well, it's up
to you.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now this is a good picture. Nice detail.
I can use it to make that sculpture,
no problem.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}M-may we borrow it?

---
label: 0003
---
Go ahead.

---
label: 0004
---
I'll pick a different one.

---
label: 0005
---
Sorry, but no.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yep. Right. I'll get it built, son and done.

---
label: Talk67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? Didn't I already make a sculpture of
this monster?

---
label: Talk68
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Waahababaaa!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}Large wings and three heads, each with
their own horn! No one can be doubting...
That is the {{color id="0"}}King Gleeok{{color id="-1"}}!
Thank you! Thank you!

---
label: Talk76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}*sigh* I hope I'll be able to add a King Gleeok
sculpture to my collection too.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But... Can't someone place it on the stage
in a pleasing spot for me?

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We went to all that trouble to get this
sculpture sculpted.

I want nothing more than to give it the
many looking eyeballs it deserves.

---
label: 0006
---
I found a nice spot for it.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hweeet?! You said what?

---
label: Talk26
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Fweeeheehee!


Behold! The king of the sky!{{size value="100"}}


*sigh* To think that we can stand here
unharmed beside such a thing. What a
thrilling thrill for one to feel!
Crafted with such good taste too, I see.
It's everything I hoped it would be!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I know it's a sculpture, of course. Still,
even I'm surprised at how imposing
it is.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes! And now we must show it to all the
eyeballs in the village!

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!


This is it...{{delay8}}the most monstrous of all
monsters! The King Gleeok!

But do not fear, draw near! This is the
only place it's safe to admire such a
monstrous royal up close. The only place!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}It is nothing short of astonishing! It has
three—THREE—heads!

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What would I do if I ran into something
like this?! I...hope I never find out.

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
Now, give me your ears! All of them!

I say again, this monster is the fearsome
King Gleeok.

Fire, ice, lightning...powers possessed by
plenty of monsters. But our noble friend
here is unique!
It controls all THREE elements at the
same time!

And while it looks like a beast from a book
of stories, {{delay8}}I warn you not to dream of
meeting it in the flesh.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}If you were to come face-to-triple-face
with this monster...arriving home alive
would be quite unlikely!
Remember please, reckless adventurers
should beware and keep away!

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Eek! Just seeing this one here is plenty
frightening for me.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
Understand what you fear and you'll
feel great!
For those with an open mind, wonders
always await!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!


Introducing the King Gleeok to everyone...
what an honor!

Please, allow me to reward you for all
you've done.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}For me, there's nothing more valuable
than the monster sculptures I've received.

But I know gems are what most folks
desire most. And here is the usual
reward as well...

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks to you, my dream is nearly
complete.

To build a collection of monsters...
to share them with everyone...to show
people that monsters are people toooo!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!

---
label: Talk86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Oh phooey! I see your pouch is full up!


I've got a pretty, pretty diamond and
some monster extract to give you, but
first you'll have to make room to carry it.

---
label: Talk87
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hooyagee?! {{delay8}}I was going to give you
a thank-you gift, but that pouch of
yours is sure to burst.
Make some room in there and I'll give
you the diamond and monster extract 
that's waiting for you.

---
label: Talk101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Weeheehee! You've made room among
your things.

Now then, please take this as thanks.

---
label: Talk102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It looks like Kilton has a little something
to give you. Better make some room for it.

---
label: Talk83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yeeheehoo! You've already fulfilled each
and every request of mine.

Buuut if you insist on assisting more,
I do want to decorate the stage with all
kinds of monsters in all sorts of poses.

---
label: Talk84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hoohoohee! Your keen interest in
monsters pleases me!

Now, more than anything, I want to have
your favorite monster picture turned
into a sculpture!

---
label: Talk59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Right. I'll get it built before you can
say "son and done."

---
label: Talk60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Mwaahaaa! Just look at that.
Magnificent work!

---
label: Talk64
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Beeyooo! A masterpiece. My mind is
boggled!

---
label: Talk65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Fwaahaha! Quality all around!

---
label: Talk66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}This must be put on display too! Go ahead
and decorate the stage with it as you
see fit.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{anim type="Humming"}}♪Quick and quality, blink and we're
done. That's why everyson chooses
Hudson Constructiooon!♪

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Son and done, as promised.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha-hiyum!{{size value="100"}}


Magnificent! Yes, this is the mightiest of
them all! The ultimate sculpture of an
invincible monster!

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It was nothing.

---
label: Talk74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thank you for all your help with the
monster sculptures.

---
label: Talk75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Thanks to you, we keep bringing these
wonderful monster sculptures to life.
My delight is extreme!

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you've got {{color id="0"}}monster pictures{{color id="-1"}} in your
possession, Hudson can make more
{{color id="0"}}sculptures{{color id="-1"}} for me. So happy I will be!

---
label: Talk94
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've got to admit, I'm feeling pretty
inspired.

If you have any other monster pictures,
please show them to me. I'm happy to
make all sorts of sculptures.

---
label: Talk93
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But I can't make anything if this
workbench isn't cleaned up.

---
label: Talk49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Foohoofeehee! You have an artist's good
taste! Could I...borrow that picture?

---
label: Talk85
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ooofafa!{{delay8}} Look at that! You really do have
the eyeball of an artist!

Though...{{delay8}}this is a picture of a monster
we've put up on the stage before.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Not to worry! Not to worry! I'm happy to
have a stage festooned with all sorts of
sculptures.
M-might I borrow this picture?

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Wonderful picture, wonderful. But it
isn't suited for making a monster
sculpture.

---
label: Talk73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you have more monster pictures, please
share them with us! They're most useful
in the making of sculptures.

---
label: Talk51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But I don't have the materials to make
any more than this...

---
label: Talk77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you bring me a sculpture from the
stage, I could break it down and use the
materials to make a new sculpture.

---
label: Talk99
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I am eager to make more sculptures.

---
label: 0007
---
Break this one down.

---
label: 0008
---
Yes, go ahead.

---
label: 0009
---
Hold on a moment.

---
label: Talk57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You sure it's OK to break this item down?

---
label: Talk53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right. I'll break this down before you
can say "son and done." Then we can see
about building you a new sculpture.

---
label: Talk54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that I've got more materials, I can
make that new sculpture.

---
label: Talk69
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hm? This sculpture?


Sure you want me to break this down?

---
label: Talk70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right. Leave it to me.

---
label: Talk71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}There you go. Broken down before you
could say "son and done."

Rain can't stop my work.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've got to admit, I'm feeling pretty
inspired.

If you have any other monster pictures,
show them to me.{{delay8}} I'm happy to make all
kinds of sculptures, even in this rain.

---
label: Talk97
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure, it's raining, but that won't stop me
from working.

---
label: Talk98
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You came, even in this wet weather.
Thank you!

---
label: Talk100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It looks like Kilton has a little something
to give you. Sorry it's wet and all, but
you've still got to make room to carry it.

---
label: Talk113
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}What an honor it is to see you again.
You seem...healthy...and that's what's
most important.

---
label: Talk104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hmmm, I notice that you're quite short
on clothes-coverings. It must be because
monsters don't wear clothes!
Anyhoo, seeing you like that... It makes
me want to get back to acquiring
monster sculptures.

---
label: Talk112
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, it's that mask...{{delay8}} So sorry.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oooh, I see. It's that mask...


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm not in the business of making masks
any more. Monster sculptures are my
