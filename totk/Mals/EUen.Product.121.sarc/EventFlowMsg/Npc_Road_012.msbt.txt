{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The name's Calisa! I'm a legendary
treasure hunter of the Gerudo. Nice to
meet you!
Have you heard about the strange
phenomena going on all over the
regions of Hyrule?
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Islands floating in the sky and caves
opening up everywhere... It's a dream
come true for a treasure hunter!

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Lately I've been really interested in the
{{color id="0"}}rubble and stones falling from the sky{{color id="-1"}}.

I've even been dreaming about them!{{delay15}}
My latest dream? Hmmm...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}This big stone came tumbling out of the
sky and hit the ground and then suddenly
started to {{color id="0"}}float back upward{{color id="-1"}}.
I grabbed on to it, and before I knew it, I
had arrived at an island in the sky, full of
treasure. Can you imagine?!
Anyway, that was basically the whole
dream. {{delay15}}Too good to be true, of course.

Why would I dream about a falling stone
flying back up into the sky? Dreams are
so strange.

---
label: Talk00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you think there actually is treasure
where those {{color id="0"}}stones that fall from the sky{{color id="-1"}}
come from?
After all, I had that dream about a stone
that returned to the sky...

Heh, I'd cling to a stone if it meant
treasure was waiting at the other end
of the trip!

You could call me a treasure hunter, of
sorts. I'm after a special treasure right
now, in fact...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{size value="125"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}A shooting star!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}If you travel the roads at night, you'll
sometimes see a streak of light falling
in the distance.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I've heard stories that those are actually
{{color id="0"}}shooting stars{{color id="-1"}} that might hit the ground,
but I haven't found one myself yet.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It seems like they're about as rare as the
voe of my dreams.

Oh, sorry.{{delay15}} "Voe" is the Gerudo word
for "man."

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, I'm not going to just sit around
waiting for either one to come to me. I
won't find them unless I keep looking!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm obsessed with chasing down one of
those nighttime shooting stars.

I've heard stories that the streaks of light
in the night sky are shooting stars that
can hit the ground.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But I can't just sit around waiting for
one to come to me. I have to look for it
and the voe of my dreams!

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I mentioned before that I'm hunting for a
{{color id="0"}}shooting star{{color id="-1"}}, right?

Recently, another traveler told me how
they almost got their hands on one!

They'd spotted the star sailing through
the sky one night, but when they followed
it to where it landed, monsters attacked!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Though they eventually chased the
monsters off, they didn't reach the place
the star had landed until the sun was up.
{{anim type="Ease_01"}}By then, the {{color id="0"}}shooting star was nowhere to
be seen{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So fleeting, just like the voe of my
dreams. If you see something worth
chasing, don't hesitate, right?

I'm not just wandering around, hoping to
stumble on one, you know. I've thought
about where they come from.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}I mean, they obviously come from the sky,
right? And if that's the case...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Then if you somehow could fly up into
the sky, you'd be able to find a lot of
{{color id="0"}}shooting stars{{color id="-1"}}!
{{anim type="Think_01"}}I haven't thought of a way to fly up
there yet though. I'm still working
on that part.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As a legendary treasure hunter, I am more
than happy to share some tips with you.

The key to making new discoveries is
being able to get somewhere {{color id="0"}}high up{{color id="-1"}}!

A cliff, ruins that have fallen from the
sky... As long as it's high up, it'll work
just fine.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So get high up and look around—you're
bound to discover all kinds of things!

If you can reach a place that is really high
up, you can see a lot, right? That makes it
easy to pick your next destination.
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Maybe you want to explore some {{color id="0"}}strange
area{{color id="-1"}} or {{color id="0"}}some ruins{{color id="-1"}}? Or maybe you want
to clear out a {{color id="0"}}monster outpost{{color id="-1"}}?
Hyrule is a vast land with much to explore,
and if you've got a destination picked out,
you're in good shape.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I wish I had a map that I could {{color id="0"}}mark my
destinations{{color id="-1"}} on...

But recent events have really changed the
landscape. I doubt any of the {{color id="0"}}maps{{color id="-1"}} we
used to use are accurate anymore.
