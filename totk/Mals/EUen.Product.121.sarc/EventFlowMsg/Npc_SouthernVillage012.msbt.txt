{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It feels as if the Upheaval made
everything worse. {{delay8}}Every day, I hear
disturbing stories from travelers.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}At the stable, for instance, someone
mentioned that a giant monster has
settled down in the forest east of here.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Isn't that horrible?

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Somebody told me that a monster of
great size has settled down in the forest
east of here. How unnerving.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know Fort Hateno to the east?{{delay8}}
It's abandoned now, but it was once
the site of a great battle.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Well, I say "abandoned." Sounds like
some monsters are camped out there.
You might want to stay away.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Fort Hateno was once the site of an
enormous battle. Now it's basically a
five-star monster hotel.
The farther you are from that place,
the better.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I just hope those rumors about a
monster-control crew being assembled
turn out to be true.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Did you hear?


There's a monster-control crew here to
take care of the monsters at Fort Hateno.{{delay15}}
Really calling in the cavalry.
I would love to join a monster-control
crew—fight some monsters, give help to
those who need it.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Alas, I don't know the first thing about
weapons or tactics.

I should learn how to defend myself
before I think about protecting others...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So, the monsters at Fort Hateno are
battling against a monster-control crew...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}I wish I could help. But I really
know nothing about combat.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Did you hear?


A monster-control crew came and
defeated the monsters at Fort Hateno.{{delay15}}
Wiped them out!
I would love to join a monster-control
crew—fight some monsters, and give help
to those who need it.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Alas, I don't know the first thing about
weapons or tactics.

I should learn how to defend myself
before I think about protecting others...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}A monster-control crew defeated
those monsters, thankfully. {{delay8}}I should
probably be celebrating.
Instead, I find myself wishing that I could
have helped.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I'm not catching my breath. I'm looking
around for monsters.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You must be ready to flee the moment a
monster appears. {{delay8}}That's the only way to
survive out here.

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I don't see any monsters around.{{delay8}} But to
survive out in the wild, you always have
to be on your toes.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I hate the rain. Truly I do.


Rain limits your vision, making it easier for
monsters to sneak up.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} Maybe I should go back home to
the Gerudo Desert. It never rained there.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}More than once, monsters have snuck up
on me in the rain... {{delay8}}Terrifying.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}That's why if you ask me, rain is the bane
of every traveler's existence.

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You strike me as a voe in need of
directions. Looking for Hateno?

If you head east on the road, you'll reach
the ruins of Fort Hateno. And just beyond
there, Hateno Village.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It seemed like a lazy, laid-back hamlet
when last I was there. {{delay8}}But I hear things
have really livened up.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Take the road east, past the ruins of
Fort Hateno, to reach Hateno Village.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The ruins of Fort Hateno are up ahead.
That was the site of a great battle.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I heard a rumor that monsters are
gathering there. But if you just go to look
around, you'll be fine...{{delay8}}probably.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Up ahead lie the ruins of Fort Hateno.
You might have heard that monsters have
amassed there.

---
label: GoRange_02_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The ruins of Fort Hateno are up ahead.
That was the site of a great battle.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Monsters have gathered there, and the
monster-control crew has engaged them.

---
label: GoRange_02_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Up ahead lie the ruins of Fort Hateno.
The monster-control crew already went
out to fight the monsters amassing there.

---
label: GoRange_02_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The ruins of Fort Hateno are up ahead.
That was the site of a great battle.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I hear the monster-control crew cleared
out the monsters there, but still.{{delay8}} They
could always come back.

---
label: GoRange_02_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Up ahead lie the ruins of Fort Hateno.
The monster-control crew cleared out the
monsters, but still. {{delay8}}Stay on guard.

label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Looking for Kakariko Village?

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}To get there, you can just cross the
bridge and follow the road north.

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Everyone is abuzz about the ruins that
fell from the sky and landed there. I hear
they're highly unusual.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Cross the bridge and take the road north
to get to Kakariko Village. I hear some
unusual ruins fell from the sky there.

---
label: BackRange_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Hm? {{delay8}}You weren't asking for directions?
Apologies—{{delay8}}you looked kind of lost.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's not just more monsters around since
the Upheaval. There are also strange
machines out and about.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The way they attack... It's almost as if
they're protecting something.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}And they like to lurk south of the road,
so I should really get out of here...

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those...{{delay8}}machines like to lurk around
south of the road.{{delay8}}

I just started seeing them after the
Upheaval. As soon as they catch sight
of you, they attack!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I should really find a safer place to
walk around...

---
label: Near_StartPoint_01
---
Just horrible.

label: Near_GoalPoint_01
---
Keep your distance.

---
label: Near_GoalPoint_02
---
What can I do?

---
label: Near_GoalPoint_03
---
If only I could.

---
label: Near_RestPoint_01
---
See any monsters?

---
label: Near_RainPoint_01

I hate rain.

Ach! Rain!

label: Near_Thunder

Lightning!

---
label: Near_GoRange_01

If you head east...

---
label: Near_GoRange_02
---
Just look around.

---
label: Near_GoRange_03
---
Monsters...

---
label: Near_GoRange_04
---
Vigilance is key.

---
label: Near_BackRange_01

If you head north...

label: Near_BackRange_02

What strange machines...

That look is in bad taste.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Phew! Sa'oten. {{delay8}}The cads caught me 
off guard, or I would have been fine.

label: SavedLv1_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh!{{delay8}} You saved me.{{delay15}} Clearly I paid the price
for letting my guard down.

---
label: SavedLv2_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh... Thank you for assisting me.{{delay8}} I just
wish you hadn't seen that.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You won! {{delay8}}Well done, sword voe.
