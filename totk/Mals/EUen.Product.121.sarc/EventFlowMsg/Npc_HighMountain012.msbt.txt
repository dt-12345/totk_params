It's really no trouble.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All right, then. {{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'll take them!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm from {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}, to the northwest.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Times are tough where I'm from.
Merchants aren't able to reach my village
because of the {{color id="0"}}blizzard{{color id="-1"}}.
We're fortunate the kind folks from the
stable are sharing their supplies with us.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It's thanks to them that the children
still have full bellies.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Don't mention it, really. The Rito have
been good neighbors to us. We're just
returning the favor.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You let me know if there's anything else
you need, all right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I can arrange to have it sent here, and
then pack it up for you to carry home.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}There's no telling when the harsh weather
at {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} will let up... {{delay15}}The blizzard is
still raging west of {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But thanks to your generosity, {{delay8}}we can
endure for the time being.

---
label: Talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It's the least we can do, since traveling
merchants can't reach your village.

You need supplies, and we can afford to
share. Simple as that.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Please, take as much as you need. I don't
want any Rito children going without food!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You know, we still have a lot of firewood
and flint stockpiled.

Now that the blizzard's over, we don't
have much need for fire-making supplies.
So please take as much as you like!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}That said...{{delay8}}we're still short on food.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Good morning!{{delay15}} The sun's really shining
for us today, huh?

Every morning at dawn, my big sister,
Laissa, likes to go somewhere high up
and sunbathe.
I wonder if she's at her usual spot today.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Good evening, Mr. Swordsman!{{delay15}} Nice and
peaceful outside, hm?

You know, I'm really grateful for everyone
who helped us out during the blizzard.

{{anim type="Chat_00"}}So many people from outside the village
banded together to support us.

I just...{{delay15}} I hope that someday I can return
the favor somehow.

label: Talk2503

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Mr. Swordsman!{{delay15}} It's good to see you.


I gotta say, the children can really eat.
I don't know how their little bellies hold
so much food!
Then again, they've been helping out still
even though the blizzard's over. Maybe all
that work is building up their appetites!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}I almost forgot to ask!{{delay15}} Do you have any
ingredients you can spare for us?
