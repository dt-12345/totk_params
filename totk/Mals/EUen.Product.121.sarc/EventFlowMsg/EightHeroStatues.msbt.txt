{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was in the middle of studying that.{{pageBreak}}It may be an object of vast historical
significance. Until I {{color id="0"}}unlock its mysteries{{color id="-1"}},
whatever they are,
I don't want anyone to touch it!

Four stelae left.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh.{{delay8}} You must be that voe everyone is
talking about.{{pageBreak}}Say...{{delay8}} Are Hylian voe interested
in archaeology?{{pageBreak}}Would it surprise you to learn that I'm an
archaeologist myself? After much work,
I have finally deciphered these stelae.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Do you want to hear what's written on
them? {{delay8}}You do, don't you?

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh...{{delay8}} So Hylian voe are interested in
archaeology after all?{{pageBreak}}Do you want me to tell you what is written
here? You do, don't you?

Sure...

---

---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk0020

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What? You're joking.{{pageBreak}}No one in this town cares about
archaeology. Doesn't anyone want to hear
about my findings?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you insist!

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}First up, the stela over here, on the left.
It says:{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. Their secret will be expressed
on six stelae."

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}As for the stela over there, on the right?
It says:{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. An eighth channels and guides
the powers of these seven."

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I doubt you know this, being a Hylian voe,
but we Gerudo have believed in the
heroines for a long, long time.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They are said to have protected and
guided our people in times past.{{pageBreak}}Unfortunately, I have found little in the
way of documentation about the heroines
themselves.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There are many debates and
disagreements surrounding these
enigmatic figures.{{pageBreak}}Some argue for revering all seven as a
collective, and others, for worshipping
each one as an individual.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Certain rabble-rousing contrarians even
claim there were not seven but one!
Or eight!{{pageBreak}}If there is one thing scholars love, it is
arguing with each other.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But these stelae definitely support the
theory of eight.

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}An incredible discovery, isn't it? I could
stop here and rightly say that I changed
the face of archaeology.
But if I found the other four stelae,
who knows what else I might learn
about the heroines?
I wonder, too, about this {{color id="0"}}orb{{color id="-1"}} that I found
while searching for the stelae. Is it
connected somehow?
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}If I gave a presentation on all this, I'd be the star of
the archaeology society!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I have not been able to find any
stelae besides these two.{{pageBreak}}Since there's nothing like them on the
surface, the others must be underground
somewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}*sigh* How I wish I could see the text
inscribed on those stelae. Even just
a {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}would serve my purposes.

---
label: talk0065

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If only I had a device that makes pictures
of things, like the one that researcher at

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To learn more about the heroines, I need

somewhere, but no matter where I look,
I can't find them.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}It's possible they were destroyed or altered when
the town was constructed.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}I wish I could see the text inscribed on
those stelae, or even just a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To learn the truth about the heroines,
I need to find the other {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Num_EightHeroStatues" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="stele" arg2="stelae" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The shelter isn't so big, and yet I still
can't find them anywhere...

---
label: talk0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To learn the full truth about the heroines,
I must find {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Num_EightHeroStatues" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="more stela" arg2="more stelae" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}Or if I saw a {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}of the text on each
stela, that could work just as well.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks to you, only {{color id="0"}}one stela {{color id="-1"}}remains
before we learn the truth about
the heroines!
Tell me if you find it. I would even be
satisfied with a {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}like you got of
the other ones.

Stelae?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There are six stelae inscribed with
information about the heroines. I believe
all six are in this shelter.

label: talk0032

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What does this one say? Let's see...

---
label: talk0012

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"The seven heroines protect the Gerudo
with the powers of heart, skill, fortitude,
wisdom, flight, mobility, and compassion."

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. Their power is housed within
the seven spirits."

---
label: talk0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Curious. Does this mean that the seven
heroines' powers have changed form,
even now that they are gone?
And what could be meant by "spirits"?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What if "spirits" refers to orbs like
this one? Sa'oten! {{delay15}}I believe I've made a
breakthrough!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. Their spirits rest within the
land of the Gerudo."

---
label: talk0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So the spirits of the seven heroines are
hidden within the Gerudo region?{{pageBreak}}Confirming that these spirits are not
legend or rumor, but real, is by itself an
enormous breakthrough.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. When their powers return to
them, the shrouded eighth will be known."

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If the seven heroines' powers return,
we can meet the "shrouded eighth"?{{pageBreak}}But that must mean...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}There really was an eighth heroine? I
don't believe it! This changes everything!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I am curious about what might be written

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Only {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Num_EightHeroStatues" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of the {{color id="0"}}stelae {{pluralCase arg1="remains" arg2="remain" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}You have brought us closer to learning

stelae say!{{pageBreak}}Now to put it all together.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The eighth of them connects the other
seven powers—{{delay8}}heart, skill, fortitude,
wisdom, flight, mobility, and compassion.
We have to return the seven heroines'
spirits to them to meet this eighth. Hm.{{pageBreak}}And those spirits are all hidden within the
Gerudo region.{{delay15}} That should about sum it
up, right?

---
label: talk0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It occurs to me that there were similar
drawings on the stelae too.

I think this orb must be one of the spirits
that houses the seven heroines' powers.

---
label: talk0049

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, deep inside the {{color id="0"}}eastern area{{color id="-1"}} of
the shelter, there is a place with statues
of the seven heroines.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those statues... I remember them looking
as if they could hold something.{{pageBreak}}Maybe we should try placing the {{color id="0"}}orbs {{color id="-1"}}in
their arms.{{pageBreak}}But to do that, we'll have to recover the
other six {{color id="0"}}orbs{{color id="-1"}}, wherever they are...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Ehehe! The joys of archaeology! As soon
as you solve one mystery, another
emerges to take its place!
But I'm not deterred! I'll get to the bottom
of each and every one!{{pageBreak}}And you? Without you, I could not have
deciphered the stelae. I hope you'll help
me uncover the truth of the heroines.
You should keep this orb. You're free to
use it whenever you want.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And take this too.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}After all your help with my research,
