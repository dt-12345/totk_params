This {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}My, you do have a
discerning eye! {{delay8}}This beautiful creature is
no ordinary horse.
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It was discovered, tamed, and boarded by
none other than {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} herself!
Oh, how the princess adores this horse.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And the horse loves her too! You should
have seen them riding around together—
it was enough to take your breath away!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The poor thing's been so anxious ever
since Princess Zelda went missing.

It's always trying to go out, no matter how
late into the night. It's like the horse just
can't relax.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My theory is that it's trying to go search
for the princess.{{delay8}} Devotion like that's
nearly enough to break your heart.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}} is no ordinary horse,{{delay8}}
but one tamed by {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} herself!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You could see the love they had for each
other every time they went out riding.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Which just makes it more heartbreaking to
see how anxious the poor thing has been
since Princess Zelda went missing.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You found the {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}}! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}When the princess's horse disappeared, it
felt as if the world around me went dark.

I just kept thinking of how heartbroken
Princess Zelda would have been if she
came back and her horse was lost.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Please love and cherish that horse like
the princess herself would, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hope you and the princess's horse have
been getting along!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}While I miss being able to brush that
beautiful golden coat whenever I want...

I think the horse has a better chance of
being reunited with Princess Zelda if it's
with you.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Just give it some love for me, OK?

label: Talk1006_01

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}As long as the princess's horse is happy,
I'm happy too!{{pageBreak}}I think it's more likely to be reunited with
Princess Zelda if it's with you.{{pageBreak}}Besides, adventuring is probably a lot
more exciting than waiting around at this
stable! {{delay8}}Just give it some love for me, OK?
