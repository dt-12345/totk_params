{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Hey! Over here!

label: Talk_21

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello, my brother in research! {{delay15}}I was
waiting for you!

---
label: 0000
---
You were?

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's right!{{pageBreak}}I'm the one who discovered these big
ruins way out here.{{pageBreak}}But I wasn't able to make much progress
investigating them.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm only one Hylian, and this, alas, is not
a one-Hylian job.{{pageBreak}}That's why I wrote to the Zonai Survey
Team asking them to dispatch a
researcher to assist me.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And here you are, practically right after
I sent my letter! {{delay15}}Great response time!

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{1:1 arg="0x0000A040"}}...What?{{delay15}} You're not a Zonai Survey Team
researcher? You're just some guy?{{1:1 arg="0x0000803F"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I see...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So few people come through here, I
assumed you had to be the assistant
I asked for. {{delay15}}My mistake.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I haven't made any particularly
notable discoveries as of yet, so I can
investigate alone until I do.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But I'm certain that I'm on the brink of
brilliance!{{delay15}} Come back soon so you don't
miss history being made.

Help still hasn't arrived.

label: Talk_53

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, you're back.{{delay8}} Hey.

---
label: Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey.{{delay8}} Isn't it a little late for you to be
poking around old ruins?

---
label: Talk_87
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey.{{delay8}} There's nothing quite like ruins in
the rain, is there?

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So few people come through here, I
assumed you had to be the assistant
I asked for. {{delay15}}My mistake.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}After all the trouble I've gone to...{{delay15}} Can't they send
one assistant to help with my {{color id="0"}}monolith research{{color id="-1"}}?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0001
---
Monolith research?

---
label: 0002
---
Good luck with that.

---
label: Talk_79
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I guess all I can do is wait around until they
send somebody...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oops.{{delay15}} Did you hear that?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Sorry.{{delay15}} Scrub that from your brain. It's not
meant to be public knowledge.

---
label: Talk_61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If you were from the Zonai Survey Team,
I could tell you all about what I've
discovered so far. {{delay8}}But you're not, so...

---

---
Let me help!

---
label: 0004
---
Bye, then.

---
label: Talk_78
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh,{{delay8}} goodbye.


{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I could accomplish such great things with even one
adventure-ready assistant...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm.{{delay15}} I appreciate the offer, {{delay8}}but that's
really not allowed.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Then again...{{delay15}} Though he may not be a researcher,{{delay8}}
he does have the look of an adventurer about him.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Maybe his expertise will get things back on track.{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}You know what? You're hired!{{delay15}} For this
project alone, I'm appointing you as my
research assistant!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Come on! {{delay8}}Let's find out what secrets
these ruins are hiding!

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well then, we can dive right in.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}I'll start by showing you what my research
has uncovered so far. {{delay15}}Wait there.

---
label: Talk_62
---
Oof!

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Take a look! {{delay15}}I think you'll be pretty
surprised by this discovery!

---
label: Talk_91
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If we're going to figure out the mystery of
these ruins, you need to know everything
we've uncovered thus far.

---
label: 0007
---
The age of legends...

---
label: Talk_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? What about the age of legends?

---
label: Talk_68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now I see...{{delay8}} You're looking for ruins from
the age of legends.

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Sorry to say, you won't find what you're
after around here. {{delay8}}These ruins are from
an entirely different era.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}That said...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're that curious, you should pay
a visit to the Zonai Survey Team
headquarters in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
They've chronicled every scrap of info
they've come across.{{delay8}} If anyone can help
you find your ruins, it's them.

---
label: 0008
---
Kakariko Village?

---
label: 0009
---
Thank you!

---
label: Talk_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Kakariko Village is a Sheikah village
located east of Hyrule Field, north
of Dueling Peaks.
The Sheikah have always loved their
research, but these fresh Zonai ruins
really have the village hopping.

---
label: Talk_75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I hope you find what you're looking for!

---
label: 0010
---
Where's Kakariko again?

---
label: 0011
---
Got it!

---
label: Talk_76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm counting on you!

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Eh? Eh?{{delay15}} Aren't you surprised?

---
label: 0005
---
Yeah! Wow!

---
label: 0006
---
Um...

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Right?{{delay8}} Riiight?{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I take your restrained reaction to mean
you've never seen a Zonai relic before...{{delay8}}
Allow me to explain.

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Zonai were an ancient civilization
with their own system of writing. {{delay15}}Almost
no one living today can read Zonai script.
But you can read the inscription on that
monolith, right? {{delay15}}That's because it's
written in Hyrulean.

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Though these ruins appear to be Zonai
in origin, they feature text written in
modern Hyrulean.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}How could that be? {{delay15}}Who built these ruins
and for what purpose?

---
label: Talk_71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is just a possibility, but the monoliths
that were found might be pointing to a
spot somewhere in the ruins.
You and me, we're going to get to
the bottom of this. I need you to find
that spot.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There, we may find yet another monolith
that tells us why these ruins were built...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It's just a hunch, but it's also your boss's
hunch. So...

---
label: Talk_80
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm still searching the ruins, just in case
there are more monoliths to be found.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm a little low on assistant-requiring
work right now, but keep checking back
in case I find any more monoliths!

---
label: Near_02
---
Sage... Secret technique...

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's my plucky assistant, getting to
work bright and early! {{delay15}}I know I can count
on you to propel our research forward!

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}There you are, my assistant! {{delay15}}I know
I can count on you to propel our
research forward!

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You're working late! {{delay8}}Don't overdo it, OK?{{delay15}}
I can't have my trusty assistant getting
worn out.

---
label: Talk_88
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look at you, working through the rain!{{delay15}}
I'm glad for your aid, assistant, {{delay8}}but please
be mindful of your health.

---
label: Talk_92
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, partner! {{delay8}}Thanks for coming.{{pageBreak}}Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but
while I appreciate you checking on me,
I don't have any discoveries to report.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'll keep up the search though, so stop
by again, and maybe I'll have something
that needs your expertise.

---
label: Talk_63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, yeah! {{delay15}}I discovered a new monolith
while I was exploring the ruins.

---
label: Talk_64
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's right over there.{{pageBreak}}At a glance, it seems different from the
other monoliths. You should get closer
so you can see what it says.

---
label: Talk_81
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there, assistant! {{delay15}}That monolith is
one of my newest discoveries.

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's just a guess, but...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I think of all the Zonai ruins that have
been found thus far, these might be the
most recent.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The monoliths make mention of someone
called a sage. But who is that?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hm... {{delay8}}I think we can say with certainty
that they are connected somehow to
these ruins' creation.

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My gut is telling me that there are four
of these monoliths total.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Which would mean that only one remains
to be found. {{delay15}}We're on the brink of figuring
it all out! I know we are!

---
label: Talk_89
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If there are any monoliths you haven't
investigated, don't be shy, assistant!
Get close, and take a good look.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The "owl," the "dragons"... {{delay15}}Could those
be statues? There's one nearby that does
look like an owl.

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"Two dragons"... {{delay8}}That description reminds
me of something I saw when I first arrived
at these ruins.

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There was a small ring of dragon-head
statues somewhere, wasn't there?{{delay8}}
Ominous place...{{pageBreak}}Where was that again?

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. There are a lot of dragon statues...
But we're looking for one with a long
body, sounds like.
What's with that mountain of death part?{{delay8}}
That's...{{delay8}}troubling.

---
label: Talk_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You found it? {{delay15}}The place the monolith was
talking about?

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So that's where it was!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Excellent work! {{delay15}}I'll go and take a
look shortly.

---
label: Talk_90
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. It seems there's nothing more you
can help me with for now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'll investigate alone for a while. Just
check back in when I inevitably make a
new discovery.{{delay15}} I'm counting on you!

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay15}}You already found the place the
monolith's talking about?

---
label: Near_03
---
Huh?!

---
label: Talk_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}My trusty assistant! You're back!

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I thought I could hear a loud noise from
deep within the ruins. {{delay15}}You heard that
too, right?

---
label: Talk_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}That was unsettling. {{delay8}}I wonder what might
have caused it.

---
label: Talk_85
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Did you hear it too?

---
label: Talk_86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That loud noise coming from farther within
the ruins... {{delay8}}What was that?

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Heyyy! {{delay15}}Hellooo! {{delay15}}Are you there?

---
label: Talk_65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Heyyy!{{delay15}} Is somebody there?

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So this is what was waiting for us beneath
the ruins.

---
label: Talk_69
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Wait—{{delay8}}you found another monolith?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}If it was hidden away down here, there's
almost certainly something important
written upon it!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh...{{delay15}} My heart is pounding... Shall we
read it? Dare we?

{{anim type="Happy_00"}}We dare!{{delay8}} Here, allow me!

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Wait... {{delay15}}K-King Rauru?{{delay8}} Imprisoning the
Demon King?!

---
label: Talk_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Rauru is named in legend as the first
king of Hyrule!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}And this mention of imprisoning the
Demon King...{{delay8}} This monolith is no doubt
a chronicle of the Imprisoning War!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_01"}}My heart won't stop pounding... {{delay15}}Let's
read on!

---
label: Talk_93
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I see! {{delay15}}In other words...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This ruin is dedicated to the sages who
fought with Rauru, the first king of Hyrule.{{delay8}}
It was built by Hylians afterward!{{pageBreak}}That explains why there was Hyrulean text
on the monoliths we found.

---
label: Talk_59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}What a discovery!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_94
---
I'm astonished to find so profound a
secret hidden in these long-buried ruins,
so full of mystery...

---
label: Talk_67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll stay here for now to analyze what's
written on this monolith.{{pageBreak}}Once my heart rate returns to normal,
I'll swing by the survey-team base in
Kakariko and turn my findings into a book.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I can't wait to see the looks on their
faces!{{delay8}} Ahaha!{{delay8}} Oh, this is gonna be great!

---
label: Talk_60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Oh, whoops.{{delay8}} I completely forgot to give
you a reward...

---
label: Talk_77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I never could have solved the mysteries
of these ruins without you, my assistant.{{delay15}}
You have my thanks!

---
label: Talk_77_01

Please, take this!

---
label: Talk_77_02

And this, too, as a bonus!

---
label: Talk_77_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If you came all this way just to see
some ruins, {{delay8}}you must be almost as
fanatical about Zonai history as I am!
So please, enjoy these Zonai artifacts
I discovered—{{delay8}}mementos to remind you
of our time working together.

---
label: Talk_77_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, fear not. Since I'll be sticking
around a while, you can come back if
ever you'd like to talk ruins and relics.
In the meantime, happy trails!{{delay15}} Goodbye,
my trusty assistant!

---
label: Talk_82
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} I'd hoped to give you something
as thanks, but...{{delay15}}your pouch is too full
to hold it.

---
label: Talk_83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Please do organize that pouch so I can
thank you. I have a {{color id="0"}}large Zonai charge
and a big battery with your name on them{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
Oh, yes—{{delay8}}and a {{color id="0"}}diamond {{color id="-1"}}too. Don't delay!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It looks like you organized your pouch!{{delay8}}
Well then, please take this.
