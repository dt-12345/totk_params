{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Swordsman, welcome back!


Princess Zelda disappeared underground,
so there's a strong chance the Depths will
give us clues to what's happened to her.
I also suspect that important ruins are
hidden in the Depths, and I need to know
about them. So, my research continues!
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you make any new discoveries about
the Depths, let me know, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm certain that the Depths will give us
clues to what's happened to Princess
Zelda. So, my research continues...
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh! And if you make any new discoveries
about the Depths, let me know, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Um, yes? {{delay15}}Did you need something,
Swordsman?

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}No way! {{delay15}}{{color id="0"}}Kohga{{color id="-1"}}, the leader of the Yiga
Clan, was there?!

Oooh, this is dangerous!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've gotta regain my composure... 


OK. Come this way.

---
label: Talk_New01_01_025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, you faced {{color id="0"}}Kohga{{color id="-1"}} in the Depths? Hmm,
what's the leader of the Yiga Clan up to
down there...
From what I know, the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan {{color id="-1"}}is a
super-dangerous group that schemes
against the kingdom of Hyrule.
And {{color id="0"}}Kohga{{color id="-1"}} has had it out for you and
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}for a long time. He'd do
anything to put an end to your lives.
Despite everything we're looking into
already, we just can't take our eyes off
this threat.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Besides, Kohga could know what's
happened to the princess. That would
make a lot of sense...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you do go after him, keep in mind that
I'll be continuing my research of the
Depths from right here.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Whoa! {{delay15}}The Yiga Clan's leader, {{color id="0"}}Kohga{{color id="-1"}},
was there?!

He's had it out for you and Princess
Zelda for a long time. He'd do anything
to put an end to your lives.
We can't take our eyes off that kind of
threat. He's dangerous.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Kohga might know something about

When we dug a little deeper, we learned
that the statues in the southwest led
beneath Gerudo Town.
So I was thinking there may be a
connection between the surface and
the Depths.
So I tried investigating the chasms in
every region, to follow my hunch.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And then we found a {{color id="0"}}new chasm{{color id="-1"}} on
{{color id="0"}}the cliff face at Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} in Hebra

getting close to figuring out more about
the princess...
You and me, Swordsman—I just know we
can do this!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hi, Swordsman! Welcome back!


You look like you're in a good mood...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Did you discover something, hmmm?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hi, Swordsman! Welcome back!


You've got that awful mask on...


But even so, you seem to be in a
good mood.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Did you discover something, hmmm?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Wow! You defeated Kohga?! Well, of
course you did—you're the swordsman!

So did he have any clues about
Princess Zelda?!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Oh no... Nothing, huh...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Well, even so, that's one less danger
for the princess!

I'm not even surprised you did all this—
you're the swordsman!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'll be hard at work here with my research
into the Depths.

So just come let me know if you find
anything out, Swordsman.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Swordsman! Welcome back!


I know it's rough because we still don't
know where Princess Zelda is...

She disappeared underground, so there
might be some connection to the Depths.

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'll continue with my research on it!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's GOT to be a connection between
Princess Zelda and the Depths...

{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'll continue with my research on it!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Oh my goodness. It's just you.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That was NOT funny. Cut the
jokes, please.

I'm busy working on my research into the
Depths—I don't have time for pranks!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Swordsman! You're still wearing that?


What, did you end up joining them after
you went to investigate them?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Haha!{{delay8}} No. No way that would happen.
{{delay15}}Anyway, I wish you'd cut it out with the
bad jokes already...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm working really hard on my research
into the Depths here.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Swordsman, what happened to
your clothes?

Oh no! Did the Yiga Clan attack you and
shred them up?!

Ugh... I'll keep researching extra hard so
that you don't have to end up in any more
dangerous situations!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Doc praised my work?!


Because of my research, you were able to
locate the Demon King...{{delay15}} Really?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Wait...{{delay15}} The...{{delay15}}Demon King...{{delay15}}


You mean, like...the Demon King?
Not just any ol' demon king but...{{delay15}}
THE Demon King?{{delay15}}
...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}{{size value="125"}}Wow! {{delay15}}{{color id="0"}}The Demon King{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


AHEM. Er, so...anyway.{{delay8}} The Demon King
might hold the answer regarding
Princess Zelda's whereabouts... Hm...
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Obviously I'm not allowed into the Depths
myself, being a kid and all. But I want to
continue to help out, even if I can't go.
I've really poured my heart into
researching the Depths...{{delay8}} And all
that work really paid off.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm so happy I put my all into this!

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thank you for telling me, Swordsman!

label: Talk_New01_05_002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Obviously the Demon King's a real
problem. But we've got a lead on
Princess Zelda from the Depths now.
I'm so glad my research was helpful to
you and Doc...

I feel like the Depths holds more value
for us.

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So I'll keep it up with my research!

---
label: Talk_New01_05_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Obviously, the Demon King is a problem.


But still, I'm glad my info was helpful.


Even so, there's more work to be done.
The Depths are still filled with unknowns.

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So I'll be hard at work here on
my research!
