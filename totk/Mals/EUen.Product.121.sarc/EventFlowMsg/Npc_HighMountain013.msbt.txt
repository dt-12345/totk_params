{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Hm, well! {{delay15}} I wasn't expecting to run into a
Hylian out here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I'm observing the clouds and the winds
in hopes of learning the cause of this
blasted blizzard.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I could probably learn more from a higher
vantage. Unfortunately, flying isn't an
option. The gales are too strong for it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}If we want to learn what's causing this
blizzard, we'll need a view from up high.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Unfortunately, with such strong gales,
flying isn't an option. I'm stuck observing
from ground level.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Say, thanks for helping me before!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Those flying monsters really had it out
for me. Without you there, I could never
have gotten those supplies to the village.
Now I'm helping Bedoli sort and give out
all the supplies we collected.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}We owe you a big debt of gratitude.
Really we do.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Heya! Glad you're here! The village has
settled down quite a bit, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}With your help, and now that the blizzard
is over, I delivered the supplies to the
village. They ought to hold us for a while.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You really came through. I owe you a debt
of gratitude.
