{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Say, if it isn't the miracle worker who was
so kind to us back in Gerudo Canyon!
Fancy running into you here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I take it you're looking for endura carrots?


My wife and I too. She's hoping they'll
beef up my constitution a bit.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}We haven't found any, but between you
and me? I don't mind. I'm happy just
spending time with her like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Endura carrots are harder to find than
you'd think!

But that's OK. I get sick easily, and the
fresh air is probably good for me.

Anyway, if my wife and I don't find some
soon, we'll move our search higher up
the mountain.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm starting to think there aren't any
endura carrots around here.

Maybe it's time to check higher up
the mountain. After all, now I'm well
enough to actually climb it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're going to wait to search for endura
carrots until after the rain has passed.

I don't want to catch a cold and worry
my wife.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It's the simple things that make me happy.
Like talking with my wife about what we're
going to do tomorrow.
When I was sick, I could barely speak,
let alone think about making plans.

Thank goodness you came along with
those Gleeok guts.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ah, how I love a night out in nature!
The stars, the cool air... Glad I'm healthy
enough to enjoy it all.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's starting to rain! Let's head over there.

I don't see any...
