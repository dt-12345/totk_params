{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I just knew you'd come!


Turning Death Mountain into a mine-cart
course is a pretty groundbreaking idea,
if I do say so myself!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I was hoping it could be Mine-Cart Land's
main attraction...

But the idea is so groundbreaking that
I haven't drawn a single customer.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Which makes you...{{delay8}}my very first!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}This is a super-hard course only for
serious carters!

And since you cleared my brothers'
courses, I imagine you'll take it on with
a smile!
You, uh, wouldn't have come all this way
if you weren't gonna play, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}The rules are simple as can be!{{delay15}}

the cart down Death Mountain, and {{color id="0"}}reach
the goal {{color id="-1"}}within the time limit to win!
Ya do tend to pick up a lot of speed
racing down a mountain though, so
watch out for that!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}I...didn't think anyone would be able to
clear my course.

I gotta say...{{delay8}} You're incredible.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}What an amazing record!


I never thought I'd see a record like
this one!

---
label: Talk57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}I...{{delay8}}didn't think that score was possible.{{pageBreak}}Goron or Hylian, I've never seen anyone
handle a mine cart like you!

---
label: Talk59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Y-{{delay8}}you popped every single one of them!


You're better at cartin' than any Goron!{{delay8}}
No, more than that...

You're the greatest carter in the world!

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Oooh, bad luck there.


But I did design this course to be super
difficult. The challenge is part of the fun!

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If ya wanna score high, ya gotta prep.
Especially for a course this tough.

You can strategize by carefully picking
your bow and arrows{{delay8}} or modifying the
mine cart to suit your needs!

---
label: Talk61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}At the end of the day, I want you to have
fun, {{delay8}}so I'll let you try it for free just one
more time.

I'll give it another try.

---
label: Talk56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Three words of advice for clearing this
course—prepare, prepare, prepare!

Bring your favorite bow and arrows,
change the mine cart however you like—
give yourself every advantage you can!
Really think things over and come back as
soon as you're ready!

---
label: Talk60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wanna give it another go?

---
label: Talk38

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}A... A new record?!


How did you get a score that high on a
course this tough?!

---
label: Talk22

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Here's your prize.

---
label: Talk63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}And that's not all!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Pretty cool, huh?


You should take that cloth southeast to
the {{color id="0"}}dye shop {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}. I'm sure
they can make it even cooler!

---
label: Talk24

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}We'll always be happy to welcome you
back to Mine-Cart Land. {{delay8}}Even happier if
you shock us with the highest record!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'll give you some arrows for your
next attempt.

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}You're back! All right!


The course continues to be a hair too
groundbreaking to attract any customers.

But every time you turn up, it makes me
think that all this grueling, strenuous
labor was completely worth it!

label: Talk36

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The game costs {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}} to play. {{delay8}}For

my brothers' courses in the Southern
Mine as well.

new high scores!
