{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, buddy.{{delay15}} If you're going to Gerudo
Canyon over the suspension bridge,
you'd better be careful.
I used to have a stable in the canyon...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But ever since the Upheaval sent the
weather all screwy, horses hate the place.{{pageBreak}}No horses meant no travelers meant no
business for my stable. I was ruined.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I had no choice but to relocate and
open a mini stable over here.{{pageBreak}}But boy, do I miss the old spot...

I know all about it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Members who visit stables and use their

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, you do? Then I guess you just
dodged a lot of hot air.

---
label: Talk_98

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}On that note, you get a point for using
this {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}} for the first time...

---
label: Talk_95
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'll go ahead and tack {{color id="0"}}one point{{color id="-1"}} on to
your Pony Points card.

---
label: Talk_99
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So you get one point for using this

another for {{color id="0"}}registering a horse{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_100

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'll go ahead and tack{{color id="0"}} two points {{color id="-1"}}on to
your Pony Points card.

---
label: Talk_101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}So you get a point for each new stable
you visit. Rest at one? Pony Point.
Register a horse? Point this guy up.
Save up enough points and you can earn
some mighty fine {{color id="0"}}rewards{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Not that this mini stable has any of
those on hand. You'll have to go to a
full-blown {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}to get 'em.

---
label: Talk_91
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}That's a brand-new horse registration,

Pony Points card.

---
label: Talk_84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Well! It looks like you've built up a nice
little pile of points.

I wish I could give ya something, but if
you want rewards, you'll have to visit a
full-fledged {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_76

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The closest one of those is probably
{{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable northeast {{color id="-1"}}of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm running this mini stable all on my

But my mini stable here is a one-man

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry, I can't give ya any Pony Point

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Well, sure, if you wanna hear it again,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wild horses are wary creatures.{{pageBreak}}If you wanna get close, the trick is to

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Once you're riding and the horse settles
down enough to listen to your commands,
bring it to a {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Let's get this horse registered, shall we?

label: Talk_72

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since you're a regular stable customer, I'll
give you {{color id="0"}}half off{{color id="-1"}} on the fee. So it'll only be
{{color id="0"}}10 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
So how about it? Wanna register?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hey... You don't even have a wild horse

Wild horses are very wary, so you need
to creep up on them from behind.

It's easier to catch them if you approach
while crouching, if you can.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}OK, let's get this registration going.
