{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I almost forgot! Have you stopped by the
stable to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Rumor has it that the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}} has
moved to that neck of the woods.{{pageBreak}}I've heard that he's very powerful.
He can even resurrect a horse!{{pageBreak}}Isn't that amazing? I bet anyone who
appreciates horses would be happy
to have him around.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}*sigh* I wish he'd settled a little closer to
OUR stable.

label: DoNotWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Whoa there, {{delay8}}sir, please stop!{{delay8}} That belongs
to the stable. {{delay8}}You can't remove it!

The shape of that {{color id="0"}}ring garland{{color id="-1"}} is
supposed to bring good fortune. {{delay8}}Stables
keep them around as lucky charms.
They're made at a place called {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}} in the hills far to the southwest.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Now, if you like it so much, {{delay8}}you can go
get one for yourself.

---
label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Excuse me, sir! That's the stable's 
good-luck charm, so kindly leave it alone!{{pageBreak}}If you like it, I'm sure you can find one
for yourself.{{pageBreak}}They're made in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, a town
in the hills a ways southwest of here.

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}If you're that fixated on our garland,
why not go get your own?!

You'll find them for sale in a place
called {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. Just head to the
mountain range southwest of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I asked my family what sort of picture we
should put up,{{delay8}} and we've finally decided.

Have you seen the "Unity Bell" in
{{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} over in the east?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The story goes that if two people ring it
together, their love will last forever.{{delay8}}
All sorts of couples pay it a visit.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, I think it would be nice to paint a
{{color id="0"}}picture of the Unity Bell{{delay8}} {{color id="-1"}}and hang it here
at the stable.
All four of my daughters think it would
look perfect on the wall too!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But...I really need to go see it if I'm going
to paint it accurately.{{delay8}} And, well, work is
far too busy for me to get away.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Of course...if I had a {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}of the
bell in front of me,{{delay8}} I could just use
that as reference.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oho,{{delay8}} you have a picture of the
{{color id="0"}}Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm thinking I'd like to hang up a painting
of the Unity Bell—you know, the one over
in {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} of here.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The story goes that if two people ring that
bell together, then their love will last
forever. All sorts of couples go visit it.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My daughters have been asking for a
{{color id="0"}}picture of the Unity Bell {{color id="-1"}}to liven up
the place.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I'd go paint a picture myself, but work
keeps me too busy.

---
label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's said that if two people ring the
Tarrey Town Unity Bell together,
they'll be granted eternal love.
It would make my daughters very happy
if I hung up a pretty {{color id="0"}}painting of the
Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}} on the wall here.

Take a look at this.

Goodbye

label: 9003

I'm not showing you.

---
label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh,{{delay8}} did you bring me a picture of the
{{color id="0"}}Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If I had a picture of it in front of me to use
as reference, I'm sure I could paint up
something real nice.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}},
{{delay8}}I'd sure appreciate a look!

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ah...it's almost as if I can hear the bell's
happy ring. I hear lots of couples have
held their wedding ceremonies there.
If you ever capture a different {{color id="0"}}picture
of the Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}}, I'm happy to make a
new painting.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}All you need to do is show me the picture
so I can use it as reference!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}This sure brings back the memories...{{delay15}}
You see,{{delay8}} I did ring it once.

My wife and I rang it together, in fact.
And here we are, still happy together,
all thanks to that bell.

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks to you, Link, I finished that
painting. My daughters sure are happy!{{pageBreak}}I've even heard them say they'd like to
ring it with their own special someone.{{delay15}}
I sure hope they find the same joy I did.

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So,{{delay8}} is there something you'd like to do
with the {{color id="0"}}picture of the Unity Bell{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Each time I look at the Unity Bell,
{{delay8}}I remember the time I rang it with
my wife.

---
label: 9006
---
I'd like to change it.

---
label: 9007

It's fine the way it is.
