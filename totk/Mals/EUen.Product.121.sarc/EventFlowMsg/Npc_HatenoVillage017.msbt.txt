{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sorry, but nothing comes between the
two of us, not even you.{{pageBreak}}I met my wife in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}, to the
south of here.{{pageBreak}}She's the most beautiful woman in
Hateno Village. Maybe even all of Hyrule!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}The two of us have always guarded the

up about it.{{pageBreak}}She's at home now resting.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I picked this spot because you can see

from here.{{pageBreak}}If anything happens, I can come running

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Oh, were you not on your way to Hateno
Pasture up ahead?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I know most folks here are obsessed with
{{color id="0"}}Cece-brand{{color id="-1"}} fashion right now.{{pageBreak}}But the best thing about this village

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh? So you weren't on your way to the

research ancient ruins.{{pageBreak}}Now, though, I've heard they're hard at
work on some kind of...padding, I think?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, for a while the place was quiet,
but now Robbie's back again.{{pageBreak}}So the banging and clanging is as fierce
as it ever was.{{pageBreak}}Whatever this padding they're hard at

one of the {{color id="0"}}great inventions{{color id="-1"}} of the century.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh? So you weren't on your way to the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Isn't this spot nice and quiet? Not like

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Next to what my wife's going through,
