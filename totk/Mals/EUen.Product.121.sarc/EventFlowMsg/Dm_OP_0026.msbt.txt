{{anim type="Think_01"}}I can sense Zelda's presence back near
those stairs you passed earlier.

label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_001_b_00

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I would suggest going there first and
seeing what you can find.

label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_003_b

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}This door stands as a test of your own
overall vitality.

label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_010_b
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You remain in a weakened state. You're
not yet strong enough to open it.

label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_004_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But...there is one more shrine on
this island. There, you can get
another blessing.

---
label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_005_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}If you add that to the other blessings
you received at shrines and offer them
all to the Goddess...
you might just find your way forward
after all.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Let me see the Purah Pad...

---
label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_007_b
---
{{anim type="Description_00"}}The Purah Pad lets you travel to certain
places instantly.

---
label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_007_b_00
---
Now, see all of the blue marks on
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_008_b
---
You can travel instantly to any of them.
I'd suggest the one at the bottom of
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Dm_OP_0026_Text_009_b
---
Use the travel function to reach that area
quickly. You'll find the last of this island's
shrines around there somewhere.
