A Bokoblin looks like...

---
label: Near02
---
Rain, rain, what a shame.

---
label: Near03
---
I don't mind the rain, but...

---
label: Near04
---
Now to the stage...

---
label: Near05
---
The reward...

---
label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What I'm trying to say is...


A {{color id="0"}}Bokoblin{{color id="-1"}}'s most distinguishing feature
is its nose, which you'll find squished
upon its face like...GLOOF!
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Its ears, on the other hand, are quite
FWOOPY, and its horn goes ZWIIIFF!

---
label: Talk69
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Wind or rain,{{delay8}} I can still explain!

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. That description of yours... Can't
say I get the picture.

---
label: 0000
---
What's going on?

---
label: 0001
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I want to try my hand at making this
sculpture. I just...don't get what it's
supposed to look like.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah hey, it's you.

---
label: Talk43
---
This is Kilton. He moved in to Tarrey Town
the other day.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}He asked me to make a {{color id="0"}}sculpture of a
monster {{color id="-1"}}for him.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry, sorry! I am an awful describer
of things.

I would draw you a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}} of a
Bokoblin if I could. But there is no art to
be found in the bones of my body.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But fret not! I, Kilton, will describe the
monster to you with more enthusiasm
and much zest. Surely that will help!

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Eh, well, {{delay8}}it would be better if I had a
{{color id="0"}}detailed picture {{color id="-1"}}to refer to.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. I'm trying to understand but I can't
quite see it.

Without a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}} of this {{color id="0"}}Bokoblin{{color id="-1"}}
thing, I don't know what I can do.

---
label: 0002
---
How about this picture?

---
label: Talk08
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Dya... {{delay15}}Dyaaaaaah!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


Th-that's it exactly! That's the Bokoblin
I'm looking for!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A magnificent picture-painting indeed!
And yes, this is a monster to be sure!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But...{{delay8}}it's not a Bokoblin.


Bokoblins' ears are more, how do I say...{{delay8}}
FWOOPY...{{delay8}}and their horns are sure to go
ZWIIIFF!

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}If only I had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}}
of a Bokoblin...

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, now this is a good picture! Let me
use it for reference, and I can make the
sculpture, no problem.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}M-may we borrow it?

---
label: 0003
---
Of course!

---
label: 0004
---
I'll pick a different one.

---
label: 0005
---
Sorry, but no.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hiyeeee! Nooo!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I had that picture, the sculpture would
be son and done. But...I can't force you.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Great, just leave it to me. I'll get it
made, son and done!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha-hiyoo!{{size value="100"}}


Look at this! It is the very monster
sculpture I've been longing for!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It was easy.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now, prettiest please, would you pick
the perfect spot to display this sculpture
on the {{color id="0"}}stage {{color id="-1"}}over yonder?

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm afraid I can't do that.

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Bwaaa?!

---
label: Talk70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's not that I mind working in the
rain, it's just...

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've got a rule against making that kind
of decision. Too much responsibility.
Not my thing.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Awww...{{delay8}}but...but...who will arrange it
on the stage for me?

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We went to all that trouble to get this
monster sculpture sculpted...

I want nothing more than to give it the
many looking eyeballs it deserves.

---
label: 0006
---
I found a nice spot for it.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hwaaah?! What did you just say?

---
label: Talk23
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ooh! OOOOOOH!{{size value="100"}}


Such artistry! It's everything I ever
hoped it would be!

And so realistic too! It's as if my nose
holes might catch a whiff of monster
scent at any moment!

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's true! Even I could mistake that
sculpture for a living, breathing
monster!

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! {{delay8}}And thank you once more!


You've not only helped my younger
brother but me too!

Please, take this as a token of my
thankfulness. {{delay8}}It's a concoction of my
own making, you might say.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You are a great artist, worthy of renown.
And because of you, I've taken the first
step toward making my dream come true!
I have long desired to collect sculptures
of monsters from around the world and
display them for all the eyeballs to see.
I hope this will help shine a light on
these magnificent creatures and the
many wonderful ways about them.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes, now we must show it to every eyeball
in the village.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!


I present to you the famed Bokoblin!


Do not fear, draw near! This is the
only place you can safely admire such
a creature up close. The only place!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aww! When you look at it like this, it is
rather cute.

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
Now, give me your ears! All of them!

Without further ado, this adorable,
cuddle-able monster is called a
Bokoblin.
They make house and home throughout
Hyrule and are, perhaps, the monster
you've rubbed shoulder bones with most.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}With their large, fwoopy ears and cute,
gloofy snouties, one can't help but want
to give them a tight squeeze.
Sadly, their social skills are quite...
stunted...and it's best to look elsewhere
for a friendly embrace.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Goodness, yes, I do feel like giving it
a hug all of a sudden.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
Understand what you fear and you'll
feel great!
For those with an open mind, wonders
always await!

---
label: Talk42
---
I'll put the Bokoblin here.

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Why, hello there, you!

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's an honor to see your face with my
eyeballs once again, and on such a 
pretty-pretty day no less.

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}My lips do curl into a grin at the honor
of bumping into you again. And on such
a handsome night too!

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}To cross your path again! An honor!
A pleasure!{{delay15}} And I see you're moisturizing
your face skin. Hydration is so important.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My little brother, {{color id="0"}}Koltin{{color id="-1"}}, is faring well,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You met again with my younger brother,
{{color id="0"}}Koltin{{color id="-1"}}, didn't you!{{delay8}} I can smell it!

He is a bit...eccentric...I know, I know!
But I hope you'll find it inside your heart
to treat him with kindness.

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah, where are my manners? I have yet to
greet you properly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Kilton, at your service!


Once upon a time, I made goods from
monster parts, you see, and traveled
about selling them from my shop.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But once I had saved up a tidy little
nest omelet, I gave that stall to my
younger brother.
Now I've purchased this plot of dirt land
so that I can, at last, make real a {{color id="0"}}dream{{color id="-1"}}
I've dreamed since I was a wee Kilton.

---
label: Talk41

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sadly, it seems the president of {{color id="0"}}Hudson
Construction {{color id="-1"}}is very busy...and I can't
take my next step forward without him.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Still! It's only a matter of time before my
{{color id="0"}}dream{{color id="-1"}} is not a thing stuck inside my skull,
but a thing here in the world instead!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Eee! I am aquiver with excitement at the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When the sun goes down and my younger

it's as if {{color id="0"}}Koltin's{{color id="-1"}} hard work and big

it makes a grin curl right up to my ears!
My big {{color id="0"}}dream {{color id="-1"}}will soon be a reality too!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahh, even as I wait for Mr. Hudson to

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}My own {{color id="0"}}dream {{color id="-1"}}will soon begin its journey

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I am exactly as I was. {{delay15}}I continue to

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Still! It's only a matter of time before my

What is your dream?

---
label: Talk49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}The truth is—and this is just between
you and me—I have adored monsters
ever since I was a wee Kilton.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, uh...


How strange.{{delay15}} This is usually the part
where you say...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}"Whaaat?! {{delay8}}Monsters?! {{delay8}}Disgusting!"


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But here you are...so sensitive to
my sensitivities.

I know, I know... Monsters are violent
creatures and despised the world over
because of it. That I can't deny.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}But they're also misunderstood!{{delay8}} The way
everyone hates them without even trying
to understand them... Pitiful! Tragic!
And so I will educate the world
about monsters...

And once the world understands
monsters, they will love monsters.
That is my dream!
But for my plan to succeed, I require
the assistance of the finest carpenter in
all the land... Hudson!

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, yes.{{delay8}} If you want,{{delay8}} I will tell my story
as many times as your ears will hear it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You see, I've loved monsters ever since
I was a wee Kilton.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Needless to say, I've been mocked and
ridiculed more times than I can count for
these tenderest feelings of mine.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, monsters are violent creatures
and despised for this bad behavior.
I comprehend! I do!
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}But they are also misunderstood!{{delay8}} And
I can't think of a sadder fate than to be
hated because you're not understood.
That's why I want to teach everyone—
EVERYONE—about monsters!

If all could comprehend these creatures,
I'm sure they could also love them.
At least...that is my dream.
But if I'm to pull this fantasy from my skull
and make it real in the world... I'll need
the finest carpenter there is. Hudson!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, where are my manners. I have yet

Once upon a time, I made goods from
