That door will open only to those with
sufficient power...

I'm sorry—I did not intend to startle you.

It was I that spoke to you earlier. That arm
originally belonged to me.

I am Rauru.

Forgive me for appearing to you in this
manner. Unfortunately, I no longer have
a physical form.

open this door. It seems to have lost the
power to do so.

You might be able to restore it, but you
would need to enter a place filled with
sacred light...

Ah, of course. Why not visit the shrines
on this island?

The shrines... Yes, I am sure they are
the key.
