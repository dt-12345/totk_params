{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm... {{delay8}}It says that there's no confirmed
connection to the ominous blizzard that
suddenly appeared over Hebra Mountain.
So really, they haven't figured anything
out yet. That's not reassuring at all.

{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I wonder if they've gone all the way out to
{{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} off to the west.{{delay8}} I'd imagine
that's where they'd find answers...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Mysterious giant clouds, and an endless
blizzard... This could absolutely be related
to the Upheaval.
I can't shake the feeling that there is
more going on in {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} to the west
than just a bad storm...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I need to do something to keep my hands
warm! It's hard to hold the paper when
they keep going numb from the cold.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You get used to the cold after a while,
I imagine.

Eventually I'll get better at reading the
newspaper with my chilled digits, haha.
