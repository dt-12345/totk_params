{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}There are some untrustworthy fellas rollin'
around the city right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}So if you're loaded up on ore, you should
probably sell it before you're scammed
out of it.

label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}We're good Gorons.{{delay15}} We'll take it off your
hands for a great price.

{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}How about...{{color id="0"}}three rupees{{color id="-1"}} for all your ore?
Whatever ore ya got! Come on, show us
the goods!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You almost got duped there, huh?


Now that Death Mountain's eruptions
have stopped and the lava's cooled, I've
been seeing more Hylian travelers.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}Which is great, except those two have
been swindling travelers {{delay8}}by offering to
take their ore for next to nothing.
After the {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast {{color id="-1"}}started
surfacing, everyone around here's been
acting strange.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So be mindful of any {{color id="0"}}Gorons who've got
marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}My name is Ramella. I'm a jeweler from
Gerudo Town in the southwest of Hyrule.

The {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}} that {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo {{color id="-1"}}deals in is high
quality, so I always come here to
replenish my stock.
If you're open to it, I'll gladly buy your ore
off of you—for my shop.

label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Wow, rude! I'd never rip you off!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well...{{delay8}}I guess you DID almost get ripped
off.{{delay8}} So your response is warranted.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm not going to force you. If you decide
you'd like to sell it, then let me know.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Right now, I'm low on amber.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If you sell me {{color id="0"}}a parcel of 10 pieces of
amber{{color id="-1"}}, I'll buy them for {{color id="0"}}a little more{{color id="-1"}} than
you could sell them for at other shops.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}All right, then. I'm off to {{color id="0"}}Goron City {{color id="-1"}}to get
more gems.

Take care!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Shoot. We almost had him.


We coulda squeezed him for every measly
rupee he had.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We'll squeeze the next one who rolls
along. But we got better things to do
at the moment.
