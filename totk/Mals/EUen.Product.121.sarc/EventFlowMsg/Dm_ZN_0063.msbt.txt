Hmm... Interesting...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aha! You came after all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I figured you would after you made that
breakthrough at the Ring Ruins.{{pageBreak}}But listen to this! I've already got a
whopper of a discovery on my hook here!

---
label: Talk_002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Here, look at this.

---
label: Talk_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's a Zonai mural, complete with intact
text. The style is unmistakable.{{pageBreak}}It's nothing short of miraculous that it's
still here and basically intact!{{pageBreak}}Which, come to think of it, might be
ascribable to the Zonai's advanced
technology.{{pageBreak}}I've got a fair bit of knowledge of the
script, so I just had a try at deciphering it.{{pageBreak}}But some of it still eludes me.

---
label: Talk_018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Maybe it's a poem? {{delay8}}Or some kind of...{{delay15}}
{{color id="0"}}code{{color id="-1"}}, perhaps?

---
label: Talk_021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Here, I'll read it out loud so we can both
get on the same page.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}This first part says, {{delay8}}"Wear the electric
garb hidden at long-necked dragons along
the wide-mouthed forest serpent."{{pageBreak}}What do you make of "forest serpent" and
"dragons" there?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}To me, it calls to mind the tall pillars
{{color id="0"}}found around these ruins{{color id="-1"}} designed to
look like dragons.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}"Forest serpent" though... I haven't seen
any designs like that.{{pageBreak}}What am I missing? What other "wide-
mouthed forest serpent" is there?

---
label: Talk_065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Maybe...hmm. {{delay8}}The "forest serpent" bit
does remind me of a song that compared
the {{color id="0"}}Dracozu River {{color id="-1"}}to a forest dragon.{{pageBreak}}But anyway, there's more to this code.
I'll keep reading.

---
label: Talk_036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Next, it says...{{delay8}} "Offer a Zonai charge to
the altar at the tail."{{pageBreak}}I'm pretty sure I got that right, but I have
no idea what it means.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What in the world is a Zonai charge?{{delay8}}
And where is this tail with an altar?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If we can crack all the riddles in this code,
I'm sure that even greater discoveries
await us!

---
label: Talk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's one other thing I'm curious about.

---
label: Talk_022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I should've mentioned this, but I found
one more Zonai relic at the back of
these ruins.{{pageBreak}}Judging from the shape, I think there's
something inside, but I can't get it
to open.

---
label: Talk_023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Can't crack the code... Can't get the box
open... This just isn't my day.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}We've got the garb. Now if we could just

I bet even greater discoveries await us!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're curious about it too, huh? {{delay8}}Let's go
over it one more time.

{{color id="0"}}these ruins{{color id="-1"}} had dragon designs. {{delay8}}But what
does the bit about "forest serpent" mean?

---
label: Talk_009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I heard a song once that compared the

that be related?{{pageBreak}}What is a Zonai charge though? {{delay8}}And
where's this tail with an altar it mentions?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh. I'm confident I'm translating this
right, but I still don't understand.

---
label: Talk_038

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Much as I want to crack this code, {{delay8}}I'm
also dying to know what's in that {{color id="0"}}chest{{color id="-1"}}
I found in the back of the room there.

---
label: Talk_010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, I noticed a relic at the rear of
the chamber. It looked like there was
something inside.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Although noticing it is as far as I've
gotten. I haven't figured out yet how
to pry it open.

---
label: Talk_039

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm very curious to know what's in that

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The treasure chest you opened had a

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}"Wear the electric garb" might mean the

you found, Link.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But "offer a Zonai charge to the altar at
the tail"? {{delay15}}What's a Zonai charge? And
where is this tail with an altar?{{pageBreak}}Could another {{color id="0"}}tall dragon pillar {{color id="-1"}}be
marking the altar site, just like the
