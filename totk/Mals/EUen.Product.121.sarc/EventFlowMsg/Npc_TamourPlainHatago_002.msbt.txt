I have a ring garland too!

This weather is horrible...

label: Near02
---
A rumored beast...

---
label: Near05
---
That's so odd...

label: NakedPlayer

Down to the skivvies, hm?

---
label: BoneHorse

Is that a monster, or...

label: GoldHorse

That's a special horse.

Very impressive...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Good morning.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hi there.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It's late. Why don't you stay here tonight?

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hi. Too bad about this weather, huh?

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Why don't you rest here until the rain
lets up?

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hm? Oh, hello. {{delay8}}Welcome to South
Akkala Stable.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Sorry. I was lost in thought there.{{delay8}}


I was wondering why so many people
are SO interested in that.

That {{color id="0"}}beast is the stuff of rumors{{color id="-1"}} and is
apparently found in the south.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}A huge, tusked creature...{{delay8}} Pffft!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's gotta be made up, right?


Nobody in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}'s even seen its
footprints, let alone the thing itself.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My little sister, Gleema, won't stop talking
about that so-called {{color id="0"}}Cucco oracle {{color id="-1"}}on the
hill behind the stable.
I don't buy it, personally. There's no way
a Cucco can talk.{{delay8}} 

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}There's this rumor going around about a
{{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}} appearing at East Akkala Stable
to the northeast.
They say it can revive dead horses. {{delay8}}Pffft!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Why is everybody so quick to believe the
silliest things?

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oops. Sorry. {{delay8}}Didn't mean to waste your
time with dumb gossip.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'd better get back to work. Take it easy.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's so rainy in the {{color id="0"}}south of Hyrule{{color id="-1"}}, you
can hardly make anything out anyway.

Pffft! That must be how {{color id="0"}}rumors started
about this beast{{color id="-1"}}! Someone was probably
looking at a rock or tree or something.

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I mean, nobody in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}'s ever seen
the thing, not even its footprints.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}What?{{delay8}} You mean...{{delay15}} You've actually seen
what's behind all the rumors about
that beast?{{delay15}}
Geez.{{delay8}} From the look in your eyes, it
seems like you're telling the truth.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I thought it was all made up, but I'm kinda
happy to find out these animals are out
there somewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Now the world feels a little...{{delay8}}bigger.{{delay8}}
Thanks for telling me.

label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are {{color id="0"}}lots of rumors floating around{{color id="-1"}}
at stables. Be careful what you believe.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Oh, it's you. Welcome.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you been to any other stables?


{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}There's talk going from stable to stable
about some {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}. We hung
up a picture of it. See?

---
label: 0001

So, about Dondons...

---
label: 0002
---
Goodbye.

label: Talk26

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I just don't understand why everybody
loves rumors and superstition so much.

My rule is never to put stock in something
I haven't seen with my own two eyes.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ever since you told me there was some
truth about that beast, I've understood a
little about why rumors spread so easily.
Still, I wish people wouldn't get quite so
absorbed in them.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But since you go around the world seeing
the truth with your own eyes, I guess
you're probably fine.

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You're the one who brought a picture
of the Unity Bell, right?

Honestly, I have zero interest in all this
stuff about connections.

But my little sisters seem to like it, and
that makes me happy. So thanks.
