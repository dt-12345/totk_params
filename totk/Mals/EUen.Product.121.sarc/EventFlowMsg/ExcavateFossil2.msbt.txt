{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I thought you might show up!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Are you seeing what I'm seeing?!{{delay8}}
How adorable is the sharp, little mouth
on this leviathan skeleton?
He looks so different from the one in
Eldin too. Maybe he's another species?{{pageBreak}}Or should I say "she"? What if they're the
same species, but one's a boy and one's
a girl!{{delay8}} Oh, it's just so fascinating!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Which makes it even sadder...{{delay15}}that some of
this little dumpling's {{color id="0"}}bones are missing{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}In addition to one missing {{color id="0"}}fin bone{{color id="-1"}}...

label: Talk04

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}One of the {{color id="0"}}bones in this cutie's spine{{color id="-1"}}
is detached.

label: Talk12

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}One of this cutie's {{color id="0"}}fin bones {{color id="-1"}}is detached.

label: Talk05

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}Every step I took on the long walk
here, I thought,{{delay15}} "I can't wait to see the
{{color id="0"}}fully intact leviathan fossil{{color id="-1"}}."
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I bet the {{color id="0"}}missing bones{{color id="-1"}} are still right
nearby too... 

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Oh, I wish I could see it all together! I'd
pay anything for one good look at it.

label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}O-oh, OK. I was hoping we could talk
fossils again...

---
label: Near01
---
I wanna see the full thing...

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}After all that walking, I was really
hoping to see the leviathan fully intact...

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You...{{delay8}}fixed it? {{delay15}}You fixed it! {{delay8}}Look at that—
it's good as new!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ahhh... Take a moment to drink it all in.
Those elegant fins, that rigid back...
It's simply breathtaking!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I really can't thank you enough for fixing
my precious leviathan.

This is for you.{{delay8}} It's the least I can do
after getting to see such a darling fossil!

label: Talk09

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'd love to stay here gazing...{{delay15}}but there's
still {{color id="0"}}one more{{color id="-1"}} leviathan out there!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}They've been waiting for me for years,
and I don't wanna make them wait even
a second more!
The last {{color id="0"}}leviathan is in the Gerudo region{{color id="-1"}}.
So that's my next stop!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Actually, let me see your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk10

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They should be right around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}How adorable do you think they'll be?
My money's on SUPER adorable!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}What am I doing waiting around here?{{delay15}}
I've got to hit the road! Wait for me, cute
little leviathan—I'm coming for you!
