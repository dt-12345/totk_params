{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}We were not too late...{{delay8}} The splash fruit
that Lady Yona gave us has done its job.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Tottika!{{delay8}} We are near to the infirmary!{{delay15}}
Stay strong!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If we had not received that splash fruit
from Lady Yona, this warrior here would
have been in quite a predicament.

Too slow!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Runaway"}}{{size value="125"}}Hiyaaa!{{size value="100"}}


Too slow!{{delay8}} Far too slow!

label: talk1019

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Too slow... {{delay8}}Very much too slow!

What's too slow?

See you later.

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}The report!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}What is he thinking... Time is of
the essence!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The cliffs at the {{color id="0"}}shore of Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}
crumbled due to the Upheaval.{{delay8}}

Miraculously, an ancient ruin appeared.


{{anim type="Think_01"}}I am pleased that Prince Sidon asked the
Zora historian, {{color id="0"}}Jiahto{{color id="-1"}}, to investigate.

However, he is far too interested in
satisfying his curiosity for those ruins and
simply will not provide us with a report!
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I understand that historians believe theirs
is a labor of passion, but sometimes that
perspective is downright impractical!

---
label: talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}I was ordered to provide the prince with
a summary of the results and a full report.
I wish Jiahto knew how frustrated I am!

---
label: talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}...{{delay15}}Never mind. My apologies.{{delay15}} There is no
point in troubling you.

{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sigh...{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}Jiahto {{color id="-1"}}really is a problem.

---
label: talk1017

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} You were able to read the message
on the stone slate at {{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}?

So? What was written? {{delay8}}No... Hold!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I am grateful for your kindness, but it is
Jiahto's duty alone to submit his report
to me.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I cannot believe he has left it up to a
Hylian to report on the investigation.
Honestly!

label: talk1025

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It is truly incredible that you were able to
read the message on the stone slate at
Toto Lake. I deeply respect your prowess.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}However, it is only appropriate for Jiahto
himself to provide the report. I shall wait
here for him to fulfill his duty!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That picture of Princess Mipha standing
in the moonlight...{{delay15}} I am greatly impressed
by your drawing skills.
Witnessing your many talents encourages
me to continue challenging myself in
new ways.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I was inspired by the painting you showed
me and decided to practice the art myself!

Maybe it was the rush of emotion I felt
when seeing Princess Mipha's picture...{{delay15}}
It was refreshing for this old warrior.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}If I keep training for 100 years or so,
perhaps even I, Seggin, can surpass your
mighty drawing skill! Ha, imagine that!

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}One fine day, I will paint a picture that
evokes even more emotion than that
lovely one of Princess Mipha.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}And to do that...I must train harder than
ever every day!{{delay8}} Ha ha ha!
