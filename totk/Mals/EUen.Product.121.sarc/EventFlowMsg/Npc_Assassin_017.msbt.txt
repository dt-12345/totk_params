{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}What a massive {{color id="0"}}rock pile{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_1001

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I don't think I've ever seen a {{color id="0"}}rock pile{{color id="-1"}} this
big before.

What's going on?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm...{{delay8}} I don't get it.{{delay8}} How'd it get built
up so high?

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Kyaaah!{{size value="100"}}


Y-y-{{delay8}}you really scared me!{{delay8}} P-{{delay8}}please
don't frighten people like that!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}It's a good thing you're in your
investigation clothes, or I would have
thought you were in the Yiga Clan!
Wait, those aren't investigation clothes...


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Eeep! ARE you in the Yiga Clan?!{{size value="100"}}

You bet I am.

Of course not.

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Is this a joke to you? {{delay8}}Pretending to be
part of our clan is an unforgivable sin!

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}D-{{delay8}}don't lie to me! {{delay15}}The Yiga Clan are all
masters of disguise!

They train extra hard to make sure their
disguises are flawless to the naked eye!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If you want me to believe you, then...{{delay8}}
prove you're not hiding any Yiga clothes
under your outfit and ditch the weapons!
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}If I see you wearing clothes in my
presence again, {{delay8}}you'll be in big trouble!

I'm staying dressed.

If I must, I must.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}D-don't lie to me!{{delay15}} The Yiga Clan are
known masters of disguise!

I've heard they train really, really hard to
master the art of deception!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If you want me to believe you, then...{{delay8}}
prove you're not hiding any Yiga clothes
under your outfit!
Wait...{{delay8}} You're not wearing anything.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Huh, OK. {{delay8}}Phew!{{delay15}} But seriously, you
shouldn't scare people like that!

---
label: talk_1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Tch... Have I given myself away?{{delay8}}
I have no other choice, then.

---
label: talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, good, no more clothes or weapons,
huh?{{delay8}} I guess you're not a Yiga after all.
I can finally relax a little.

---
label: talk_1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I'm not telling you again!


If you want me to believe you...{{delay8}}prove that
you're not hiding a Yiga uniform under
those clothes and put away the weapons!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}This is your last chance! Mess around and
you'll be in for a bruising!

So, what are you doing?

---
label: 0021
---
Well then, take care...

---
label: talk_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, well, I'm investigating this {{color id="0"}}rock pile{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You're thinking, "but you can find those
all over the Depths," right?{{delay8}} Sure, but this
one is different. Look how big it is!
That said, like all the others, it DOES have
{{color id="0"}}weapons at the top{{color id="-1"}}. But anyway...

---
label: talk_1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}I warned you over and over, didn't I?!
{{delay8}}And you just didn't listen! SO rude!

---
label: talk_1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}It should be easier than ever to defeat
you now.

Taking off all your armor just because
I asked? You really are a fool.

---
label: talk_1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh, before you go!


Now that you're nothing but weak spots,
I'm going to kill you real quick, OK?

---
label: talk_1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You made it REALLY easy to defeat you.


I mean, taking all your clothes off in a
place like this? Terrible choice.

label: talk_1041

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you on investigation duty too?

---
label: talk_1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Well, check out this {{color id="0"}}huge rock pile{{color id="-1"}}...


Sure, you can find piles of rocks all over,
but none of them are THIS big, right?

---
label: talk_1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Though I still saw {{color id="0"}}weapons on top{{color id="-1"}} of it,
just like the others.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This {{color id="0"}}rock pile is gigantic{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} I've seen them
before,{{delay8}} but never one this big.

Though I still saw {{color id="0"}}weapons on top{{color id="-1"}},
