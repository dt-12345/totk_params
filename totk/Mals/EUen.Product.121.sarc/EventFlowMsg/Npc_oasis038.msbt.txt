{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That was impressive. You're very skilled.{{pageBreak}}I'm certain there's much I can learn
from studying your technique.

Even I found planning for the expert
course to be a challenge. I'm eager to
see how you handle it.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That was impressive. You're very skilled.{{pageBreak}}The expert course was difficult, even for
me. I did not expect you to complete it
and beat my time so easily.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}There's a lot I can learn from studying
your technique.

And as long as you're here, surely the
research can continue without issue.
Shabonne and I should be free to leave.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I must continue to refine my technique.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Should I reevaluate how I train my body?
Or do I need to reconsider how I plan my
run on a course...

label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Maybe I need to work on my cornering?
Where I pick up speed? {{delay8}}Hmph. No, I just
need to plan my run better.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}If I study the course from high above,
perhaps I can determine what the
fastest route will be.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}If you can view the course from high
above, maybe you'll see what route will
give you the fastest time.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I must change the way I think. I must

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Racing on the surface of the ocean...{{delay8}}
I have never experienced anything like it.

I am filled with new ideas for

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It seems I'll have to be content with
racing in my mind until the rain lets up...

No... There must be something I can use
to race, even when it's raining like this.

label: Talk_1005

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Whether it's sand, dirt, or water...you
must understand your race environment
if you're to build the perfect vehicle...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, I never thought I would feel this
inspired by a project again. And yet,
my heart is filled with excitement.
It's all because of you. You taught me
how to use a steering stick. You set me
on this new path. {{delay8}}Sarqso.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Perhaps I'll build my next vehicle to
emphasize speed...

Hmm...if I do, I'll need to consider the
impact on steering and control.

Yes, I'll need to focus on efficiency and
adjust the width of the hull...
