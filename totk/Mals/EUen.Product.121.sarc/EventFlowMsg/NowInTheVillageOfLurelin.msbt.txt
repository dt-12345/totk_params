I'm so worried...

label: Near04
---
Lurelin's in a bad spot...

---
label: Talk01_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I wonder how things are now...

---
label: Talk01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm worried about everyone back home in
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}. I keep hoping they got
away from the {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Me too... We're so fortunate to have
refuge here. I can't say the same for
everyone else...
The village is way out on the {{color id="0"}}edge of East
Necluda{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}, and there's
nowhere nearby for them to run to...

---
label: Talk01_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Rozel{{color id="-1"}}'s the {{color id="0"}}village leader{{color id="-1"}}, so he'd be
the first to know how things shook out
back home.
But we've got no way to reach him...
Never thought something like this would
happen in our peaceful little {{color id="0"}}hometown{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk01_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hm?

---
label: Talk01_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Are you a customer?

---
label: Talk01_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}You must have overheard the bad news...
But enough about that!

---
label: Talk01_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}You must have overheard the bad news...


We were speaking freely because we
didn't figure any customers would come
by at this hour. But enough about that!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can't stop worrying about everyone back
at home...

---
label: Talk02_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}There's no nearby place around
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}where folks would
be able to seek refuge, you see.

---
label: Talk02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}{{color id="0"}}Rozel{{color id="-1"}}'s the {{color id="0"}}head of the village{{color id="-1"}}—I bet he'd
know whether or not everyone is safe.

---
label: Talk02_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh?

---
label: Talk02_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Mubs! We have a customer.

---
label: Talk02_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Sorry. We were deep in conversation.
But enough about that!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Sorry. We were deep in conversation.


We didn't expect any customers at this

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Sorry. We were deep in conversation.


We didn't expect any customers at this

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sorry you overheard all that...


You see, our hometown is a place called
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}. It's a fishing village on the
{{color id="0"}}southeastern edge {{color id="-1"}}of Hyrule.
It's a small place, but our little village
had specialty shops you can't find
anywhere else.
People would travel great distances
just to visit the shops. It was a very
lively place...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But then it was attacked by pirates.
I hope everyone is all right...

{{color id="0"}}Rozel{{color id="-1"}}'s the {{color id="0"}}head of the village{{color id="-1"}}—surely 
he'd know how everyone fared.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But it's so far from here, and
we've got no way to contact him.
We're beside ourselves.

---
label: Talk03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I'm worried sick about everyone in
Lurelin Village...

Hey, maybe I should head back there and
scope out the situation?

---
label: Talk03_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Don't be ridiculous!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}{{size value="125"}}The pirates are really dangerous!{{size value="100"}}


Losing my hometown was enough, but
losing you too? Not an option.

---
label: Talk03_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah, a customer! Sorry about that. We
were caught up in conversation.

---
label: Talk03_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Everyone in the village is OK?! You...{{delay15}}you{{delay15}}
spoke to Rozel?

---
label: Talk03_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Thank goodness! Just hearing that
everyone is all right is enough for me.

The village and houses can all be rebuilt,
but there's no replacing the people.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Still, I can't imagine how they're all
feeling, with no homes to return to...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_01"}}How long do those no-good pirates plan
on staying there?

---
label: Talk03_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Well, anyway!

---
label: Talk03_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}All we can do now is hope that
those pirates leave Lurelin Village
at some point.
{{color id="0"}}Our shop{{color id="-1"}} is there too... I wonder what's
become of it.

---
label: Talk03_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}{{size value="125"}}The pirates are already gone?!


{{size value="100"}}And Rozel and everyone from the village
are OK too?!{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk03_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank goodness! {{delay15}}I'm so glad. They're all
safe. I was beside myself...

---
label: Talk03_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}To top it off, the ruined buildings have all
been restored?!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Thank you for bringing us the best
possible news!

---
label: Talk03_23

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Please, have this, as a sign of
our gratitude.

---
label: Talk03_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, looks like your pouch is full and you
can't fit any more!

I had been hoping {{delay8}}to give you a {{color id="0"}}mighty
salt-grilled crab{{color id="-1"}} that I brought from
our hometown.
But if you don't have room, I can't offer
you this gift.

---
label: Talk03_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So? Did you make some space?

---
label: Talk03_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oh, it looks like your pouch is still full.


I want you to have a {{color id="0"}}mighty salt-grilled
crab {{color id="-1"}}I brought from our hometown.

Please come back once you've made
some space.

---
label: Talk03_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That {{color id="0"}}mighty salt-grilled crab{{color id="-1"}} is my
finest cooking.

It's a dish that really brings out the
warrior in you. Please, enjoy!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}With the pirates gone, I have to wonder
how our little shop back home is looking...

Even if I have to go on my own, maybe
I should return to Lurelin Village.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}With the pirates gone and the village back
to normal, I have to wonder how our little
shop back home is looking...
Even if I have to go on my own, maybe
I should return to Lurelin Village.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But if you'd be lonely without me, then I
can stay here, Mubs...

---
label: Talk03_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Even with the pirates out of the picture,
there's work to be done.

They're going to be busy for a while,
{{color id="0"}}rebuilding{{color id="-1"}} the houses and shops.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Without any woodworking skills, you'd
just get in the way if you went back now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Instead, we should focus on saving up
money in the meantime.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That way, once the village is {{color id="0"}}restored{{color id="-1"}},
we'll have the means to reopen our
shop there!

---
label: Talk03_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Don't be ridiculous.


With Lurelin{{color id="0"}} restored{{color id="-1"}}, we villagers need to
come together and bring life back to our
once-bustling little village.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I can take care of the shop here,
no problem.

You should get the village shop opened,
pronto, and start saving money too.

---
label: Talk03_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You're right. Let's keep the business here
rolling until the village is back to normal.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Good call, yeah...


{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Though, I'd have preferred to stay with you a
while longer...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}OK, I'll make my way to Lurelin Village.
Leave the village shop to me!
