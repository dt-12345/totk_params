{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks for helping to keep our food
supplies intact. I'll deliver them to the
village as soon as I've packed them up.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}We're lucky the cave-in didn't extend
farther inside.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Also that the food I collected is still intact.
I need to pack it up and hurry it over to
the village.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's cold outside the cave. Keep yourself
warm, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hey. I owe you for opening up that cave
the last time we met.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Thanks to you, all the food I collected
made it back to the village. They needed
it too!{{pageBreak}}I wish I could say everything is fine now
that the snow has stopped...{{delay8}}but I need to
check for any damage to the bridges.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The last thing we want is any more
bridges collapsing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}From my initial inspection, none of the
other bridges look too seriously damaged.{{pageBreak}}But it couldn't hurt to inspect them again
just to be sure.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I was in the middle of inspecting the
bridges, but I'll have to get back to it
after the rain stops. {{delay8}}Guess it's break time.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm just about finished inspecting the

wasn't for this rain.
