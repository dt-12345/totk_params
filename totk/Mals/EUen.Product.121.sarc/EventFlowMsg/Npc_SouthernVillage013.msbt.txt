I wonder if everyone's OK.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Does the heart good knowing Lurelin
Village is being rebuilt through the
generosity of others.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Some folks treat manual labor like sport—
they get a kick out of hefting and hauling
things around.
If you're like that, I bet you'd even enjoy
something as cumbersome as moving
around big, heavy logs.

---
label: Talk_0204
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's nearly impossible to do this work
when it's raining. I bet most everyone
would be happy for a break, anyhow.
Most of the folks of Lurelin Village
prefer a leisurely pace.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm glad those pirates got what was
coming, but some of the villagers still
haven't returned yet.
If the village is restored to its former
glory, they'll come wandering back.
You'll see.
I...have no basis for that, mind you—I can
just feel it in my bones.

---
label: Talk_0203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Wherever they are, I hope the villagers
who've yet to return are keeping dry.

I keep thinking about the day when they
return home and fall asleep under their
own roofs, listening to the waves...

---
label: Talk_0205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}On behalf of the village, thank you for
restoring the inn.

The owner, Chessica, has since returned,
and I'm betting the travelers who visit will
spread the good news about the village.
Thanks to you and Bolson, things are
looking brighter here.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Now that the restaurant is shipshape,
the villagers are all aglow.

Kiana's cooking goes a long way in
restoring people's spirits.

My spirit is lifted, too, thanks to your hard
work and kindness.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You've gone and done it again! The
Lucky Treasure Shop is fully restored.

The owner of the shop likes to entertain
and delight people.

We all love it there, me included. So
happy to see it's back up and running.
Thank you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I'd all but given up hope on ever seeing
my house put back together... And yet,
there it is, just as I remembered it.
Thank you. Thank you so much.{{pageBreak}}A village heirloom was hung up
inside, and wouldn't you know it,
it's undamaged!
Please, go on inside and have a look at it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It's been some time since I've seen Armes

Armes is an exceptionally generous
person who shares his daily catches.

Please, help yourself to what he's

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Thanks to your efforts, more than half of
the village has been restored.

There are just {{color id="0"}}two{{color id="-1"}} buildings left in need

splendor is close at hand!

We are down to...{{delay15}}{{color id="0"}}one{{color id="-1"}} building left that

I know I've relied on you heavily through
all of this, but...{{delay8}}please help us cross the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Thanks to you, Lurelin Village has been
restored. You must feel a kinship with this
place after all the work you put in, hm?
Please feel free to ask me anything about
the shops in the village. Whatever I can
do to help.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Aha, the savior of Lurelin Village.{{delay8}} We're

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}There's plenty to see and do around here.
You can get yourself some new gear,

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm grateful that you're so interested.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Of course, of course. If it's about the
village, I'll explain as many times as
you need.

Time to stock up!

---
label: Talk_0102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Ah, then you should take a look at the
inn, the restaurant, and the general store.

---
Tell me about the inn!

---
label: Talk_0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Aha, the inn! Yes, that would be
Chessica's place along the coast.

Her {{color id="0"}}salt spa{{color id="-1"}} is particularly popular,
especially for weary travelers looking
for rejuvenation.
If you have {{color id="0"}}rock salt{{color id="-1"}}, savior, you can use
the salt spa for {{color id="0"}}free{{color id="-1"}}.

How is the restaurant?

---
label: Talk_0104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Kiana's cooking is the best in the village—
No, in all of Hyrule! You'll find her
restaurant near the village entrance.
Princess Zelda was a frequent patron and
loved Kiana's cooking as well.

In fact, the princess was the one who
named it Azure Bay!

{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Kiana enjoys preparing {{color id="0"}}rare and exotic
cuisines{{color id="-1"}}, so it's always a special treat.

And, savior, it's all free for your use,
of course.

label: 0005
---
The general store?

---
label: Talk_0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You'll find it located at the end of the
pier. If you see the flashy-looking boat,
then you're in the right place.
The shop offers {{color id="0"}}rare goods{{color id="-1"}}, and travelers
come from afar just to shop there.

Of course, savior, everything available
there is {{color id="0"}}free{{color id="-1"}} for you and you alone.

---
label: Talk_0117
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That would be Garini's shop at the end
of the middle pier.

However, his boat, which is his tool for
acquiring his wares, has gone and
floated off...
When he was in full swing, travelers from
afar would come to shop his {{color id="0"}}rare goods{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I sure hope his boat comes home soon...

---
label: Talk_0118
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Garini and Mubs, a sweet married
couple, set up shop on the middle
pier awhile back.
But they fled due to the pirate invasion...


A little bird told me that they headed for
a {{color id="0"}}fort {{color id="-1"}}of some sort. Type of place where
folks go for refuge?
Now that it's peaceful and pirate-free,
I sure hope they come on back and
reopen the shop.

I want to have fun!

Treasure Shop and the Lurelin Water
Rally, then.

Lucky Treasure Shop?

---
label: Talk_0108
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Mm-hmm, that's the big boat-shaped
house by the mountain, savior. The game
is simple—just choose a chest!
The owner, Cloyne, is very particular
about the prizes he gives away. They're
wonderful, and the shop is popular for it.
Cloyne won't let you play continuously
though. I suppose that builds
suspense, hm?
{{anim type="Think_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Savior, I'll let you in on a little secret... If you have a
{{color id="0"}}porgy{{color id="-1"}}, something good might happen if you {{color id="0"}}cook{{color id="-1"}} it
and hide it in your pouch before you play.{{size value="100"}}

Tell me about the race!

---
label: Talk_0109
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah yes, our famous race, in which you
ride a vehicle on the water!

The racing pros and Bolson adjust the
course daily to keep things fresh.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Maybe we should rename it to the "Savior's Race"...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Lurelin Village is almost asleep, and so

Please head to the inn for some shut-eye.
Nothing like dozing off while gazing at
your own handiwork, hm?
And if you have any {{color id="0"}}rock salt {{color id="-1"}}on you, it's
a great opportunity to take a dip in the
