{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My mentor has entrusted me with
{{color id="0"}}decorating{{color id="-1"}} a weapon in a stylish way...

She told me to "make it {{color id="0"}}sparkle{{color id="-1"}}!" And
that "it must radiate burning {{color id="0"}}passion{{color id="-1"}}!"
But I don't know what she's talking about.
She's got an allergy to monsters too, so
that means {{color id="0"}}monster parts{{color id="-1"}} are off-limits.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If I just had a weapon I could use as a
reference for where to start, that would
help a lot!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq for before!{{delay15}} Oh, I mean sarqso!


To show our appreciation for your help in
the defense of the town, feel free to take
a bow and arrows if you need them!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq for fighting alongside us! {{delay15}}Oh, I
mean sarqso!

With the sand shroud cleared away,
supplies can reach the town again. {{delay8}}
Help yourself to a bow and arrows!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My mentor has entrusted me with what
feels like an impossible task...

She said to stylishly {{color id="0"}}decorate{{color id="-1"}} a weapon,
but I just don't know how to approach
this request!
She told me to "make it {{color id="0"}}sparkle{{color id="-1"}}!" And
that "it must radiate burning {{color id="0"}}passion{{color id="-1"}}!"
But I don't know what she's talking about.
And to top it all off, she's got an allergy
to monsters, so that means {{color id="0"}}monster parts{{color id="-1"}}
won't do.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If I just had a weapon I could use as a
reference for where to start, that would

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}My mentor said the decoration should
"{{color id="0"}}sparkle{{color id="-1"}}" and "radiate {{color id="0"}}burning passion{{color id="-1"}},"
but I don't know what to do.
And she has an allergy to monsters, so
that means {{color id="0"}}monster parts {{color id="-1"}}are off-limits.

Honestly, I don't even know where to
start. What would make a good decoration
for a weapon?

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I really don't think a soldier's weapon needs
parts that sparkle...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I...um...


{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}You know you aren't holding anything,
don't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}...Got my hopes up thinking you'd have
something in hand that {{color id="0"}}sparkles{{color id="-1"}} and
radiates {{color id="0"}}burning passion{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hmmm...{{delay8}} Something isn't quite...


I don't know if I'm getting the {{color id="0"}}sparkle{{color id="-1"}}...
the {{color id="0"}}burning passion{{color id="-1"}}...from what you've
done with the weapon.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But still, sarq!{{delay15}} I mean, sarqso!


I do appreciate you trying to help!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hm. Hmmm.

this weapon!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ahhh. So if you attach a ruby like this...

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That sparkle! And the weapon positively
radiates with burning passion!

Even I can make something like this, and
it will certainly please my mentor!

Sarq for showing me such an inspiring
decoration!{{delay15}} Please, take this!

label: near0001

I'm so appreciative!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Oh. Your pouch is full.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I want to give you an Electric Keese wing.
Could you come back to visit when you
have some free space?

label: talk0023

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Because of your help, I was able to fulfill
my mentor's request. It seemed so
impossible too...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Sarq for showing me such a wonderful
decoration. Please, take this!

label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}It's the material I would recommend for
decorating weapons!

label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Normally I wouldn't recommend going out
into the desert at this hour—there are
usually quite a few monsters around.
However, if you want to test the strength
of a weapon you've added something to,
now is a perfect time!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Monsters are often waking up around
