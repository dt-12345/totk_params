{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_01"}}I wish I could call for help, {{delay8}}but then they'd find me.


Maybe I'll just whisper it as loud as I can...{{delay8}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Ugh! Why did I come back for some stupid clothes?


This could make for a good story one day, I guess...{{delay8}}
Though it won't be as funny if I die at the end.

If I whisper for help enough times, maybe someone

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}You want to hear something pathetic?
During the whole pirate raid, I was holed
up in my house, hiding.
After the evacuation, I'd snuck back to
grab a change of clothes.{{pageBreak}}But before I knew it, there were pirates
outside! So I had no choice but to hunker
down and pray they didn't find me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If not for you, they probably would've
demolished my house with me in it.

You saved my life, and you helped me
come to an important realization...

The outbuilding was destroyed, but my

it was—{{delay8}}and in perfect condition!{{pageBreak}}Moving rubble, building houses...

Princess Zelda?

label: Talk_1021

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The princess was quite fond of our little
village. She often came here, disguising
herself as a simple traveler.
It was during one of those visits that she
painted the picture of {{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}You know, Kiana's {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}} and
Chessica's {{color id="0"}}salt spa{{color id="-1"}} were both inspired
by Princess Zelda's ideas.
Really, we have her to thank for our
reputation as Hyrule's top vacation spot.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a {{color id="0"}}pond{{color id="-1"}} on {{color id="0"}}Tuft Mountain{{color id="-1"}}, that big
mountain looming behind my house.{{pageBreak}}There was a time when lots of folks went
there in hopes of finding true love.{{pageBreak}}Then those {{color id="0"}}ring garlands{{color id="-1"}}, said to bring
people close together, started being sold
in a village somewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Now there are fewer and fewer visitors
to Lover's Pond.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Still, Princess Zelda made her way out to
{{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond {{color id="-1"}}whenever she was in town.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Only in the evening though... I'm not
