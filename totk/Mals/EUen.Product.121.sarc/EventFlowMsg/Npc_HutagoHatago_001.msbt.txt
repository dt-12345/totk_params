Oh, we have one of those.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Welcome to {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now for the fun part. Because this is your
first time here at Dueling Peaks Stable...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In addition to celebrating your first use of
Dueling Peaks Stable, we want to thank
you for {{color id="0"}}registering a horse{{color id="-1"}}. So...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not only is this your first use of Dueling
Peaks Stable but you've even {{color id="0"}}lodged
with us{{color id="-1"}}. That deserves a reward, so...

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The drawings at this stable have gotten
out of hand, haven't they?

I'm sorry about that. No matter how many
times I scold them, those sons of mine
just don't listen.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If you ask them, they'll tell you they saw
some {{color id="0"}}big footprints{{color id="-1"}}, the likes of which
nobody has ever seen!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I swear, I'll never stop being surprised by
the things my kids can imagine.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, you just reminded me. Apparently a
new species of animal called a "Dondon"
has been discovered in Faron.
This old world of ours is just full of
surprises, isn't it?

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}That ring garland catch your fancy?{{delay15}}
It's pretty cute, right?

A young girl in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}to the
{{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} made it.

I put it up hoping it might bring some calm
to the travelers that visit this place.

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't give you ours, but if you really
want a ring garland of your own...

Then I recommend you buy one at
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, directly north of here.

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're really that fixated on our garland,
you should head to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} and
buy your own.
Just head north. You can't miss it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Quite the frame, isn't it?{{delay8}} I want to fill it
with an appropriately grand scene of
natural splendor, but, well...
Tell me, Link, do you know where to find
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule's most beautiful sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?

At the edge of the sea {{color id="0"}}southeast {{color id="-1"}}of here
is a small fishing village called {{color id="0"}}Lurelin{{color id="-1"}}.
It has a reputation as a resort town.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But its real claim to fame is the beautiful
moment where the sun rises over the
horizon and lights up the whole village!
And they say the most breathtaking view
of this sunrise is from the {{color id="0"}}summit of
Tuft Mountain{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'd love to see that view myself, but it's
so far away, and I can't just leave work...{{delay8}}
Nor can I climb mountains.
If only I could see {{color id="0"}}Hyrule's finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
I'd paint my own picture of it and finally
put that frame to use.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Do you have {{color id="0"}}a picture of Hyrule's
finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}, a small fishing town on the
edge of the sea {{color id="0"}}southeast {{color id="-1"}}of here, is a
famous resort spot.
And it's home to {{color id="0"}}Hyrule's finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}!
The moment the sun clears the horizon
and lights the village is truly a must-see.
They say it's best experienced from the
{{color id="0"}}summit of Tuft Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But I can't leave my job to go sightseeing
any more than I can, well, climb a
mountain. And it's so far away...

---
label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It makes me smile just thinking of seeing
{{color id="0"}}that beautiful sunrise over Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}
from the summit of Tuft Mountain.
I would love to paint that view for myself,
but I'm afraid my job comes first...

---
label: 9001

See for yourself.

---
label: 9002
---
Gotta go.

---
label: 9003
---
Sorry, no pictures here.

---
label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Do you have {{color id="0"}}a picture of Hyrule's
finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wish I had some sort of picture of
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule's finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}Then I could
paint it for myself!

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of Hyrule's finest
sunrise{{color id="-1"}}, please show it to me!

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Doesn't it look spectacular?{{delay8}} It wasn't the
easiest painting I've ever done, but what
a view!
If you can top that with another {{color id="0"}}picture of{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule's finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}, I'm happy to copy
and frame a new one.
So if you're ever struck by the urge to
replace the picture, don't be shy about
showing me something new!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}There it is! Hyrule's best sunrise over
Lurelin!{{delay8}} What majesty!{{delay8}} What breathtaking
natural splendor!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Thank you, Link. Thank you for bringing
me such an amazing sight!

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You've given us an incredible gift, Link.
I can practically feel the light of the
sunrise warming up our stable!
Right now, the whole world is in chaos
because of {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}...

But no matter how dark the night, it's
always followed by the dawn. {{delay8}}That's the
feeling that will carry me through this.

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} did you have thoughts about
that {{color id="0"}}picture of Hyrule's finest sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I've already had customers tell me that
the sight of this painting lifts their spirits!

Let's try something new.

I like it how it is.
