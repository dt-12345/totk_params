{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ooh,{{delay8}} you must be the voe everyone's
been talking about.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now, normally I wouldn't have anything
for youngsters like you, but...

I've heard a new vai is going to be coming
to town sometime soon, and that news
sparked a fire in me!
I came up with a {{color id="0"}}special version{{color id="-1"}} of my
signature drink. It's one everybody,
from vehvi to vaba, can enjoy!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}However...I can't get my hands on what
I need to make it while we're stuck here.
And I don't want to forget the {{color id="0"}}recipe{{color id="-1"}}...
Hmph. When is this {{color id="0"}}sand shroud {{color id="-1"}}going to
clear up, anyway?

I heard that I could return to my canteen

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I heard all about what you did, voe.{{delay8}}
They're saying you fought to save

You and your thin frame have more than

Because of you, I was able to return to my

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}What? Really?{{delay8}} You're not an easy one to

Well, that's OK. Come back if you find

I promised!

---
label: talk0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure thing! {{delay8}}Oh, hang on. You need to
make some room in your bag before I can
give this to you.
You can't fit anything more in a bag that

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It took some serious work, but I'm really
proud of the special version of Noble
Pursuit that I came up with!
I was inspired when I heard that a new
vai was going to be coming to town...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The drink is full of all the vitamins and
minerals you need to take on a harsh
desert day. It'll really boost your energy!
If you like it, by all means come back and
get some more.{{delay15}} Oh, but only the first one
is free.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I'll be happy to make another for you in
the future, but it'll cost {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I run a business and have my reputation

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oops, hold on... {{delay8}}You're a little short on

Maybe it's a voe custom to drink now,

Come back when you've saved up a little!

---
label: talk0012

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's a real treat, if I do say so myself.
The key is including the {{color id="0"}}special, locally

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The ice comes from the {{color id="0"}}icehouse north
of town{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}They gather the snowmelt from the
Gerudo Highlands to make the ice there.{{delay8}}
It really brings out the flavor of the drink!
But the deliveries have slowed down
lately. I wonder if the higher temperatures
in the desert have anything to do with it...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Well? {{delay8}}What are you thinking?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Anche from the icehouse asked me to

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That reminds me...{{delay8}} I'd heard a new vai
would be coming to town. Oh, I mean in

I haven't seen her though. I guess she
hasn't arrived yet...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Supposedly she's coming here from a
place called {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} I wonder how far

fine vai.

label: talk0021

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}A side of sarqso makes the drink all
the better, doesn't it?

---
label: talk0022

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}...Oh, hang on. You need to make some
room in your bag before I can give this
to you.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even if you were planning on drinking it
right away, it's best to have some space
free. That's just a good habit to get into.
I'll hold on to this drink for you until then.
