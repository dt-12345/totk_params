{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}One last thing! Have you already seen the
{{color id="0"}}Zonai ruins{{color id="-1"}} at Digdogg Bridge?

You can get there by heading west down
this road to a three-way intersection,
then turning south.
I've heard that the Zonai ruins that
showed up there are the {{color id="0"}}biggest in
the world{{color id="-1"}}.
Well, I thought it sounded interesting.
If you haven't seen 'em yet, you should
take a look.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Ah! Sir! {{delay8}}You can't just take things from
the stable as you please!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That decoration there is kind of lucky
to have around these days. The Stable
Association said I should hang it up.
They're made in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} over to
the east in the Necluda region.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Ah! Sir! {{delay8}}I told you, you can't just take
things from our stable!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}If you want your own, you'll just have to
go buy one.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}They're made in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} over to

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}Go buy one of those in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in Necluda to the east of here. Then do
whatever you like to it.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh! That's a {{color id="0"}}map of cherry-blossom trees{{color id="-1"}}.
I made it by gathering information from
customers at our stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Cherry-blossom trees are beautiful trees
with pink flowers.

---
label: Talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I worked hard making that map of them!
You won't find one like it anywhere else.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The closest cherry-blossom tree from
here is {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}, on {{color id="0"}}Satori Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.

When you {{color id="0"}}make an offering to the tree{{color id="-1"}},
a {{color id="0"}}mysterious creature {{color id="-1"}}will appear!

Or at least, that's the legend...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Ahhh, I would just love to see a
cherry-blossom tree with my own eyes!

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}One day I'll go and see a blooming
cherry-blossom tree out there in nature.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But for now, I can settle for looking at this
wonderful picture you gave me!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hm. {{delay8}}What should I put in that frame?{{delay8}} A picture of a

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}What with the Upheaval and all, these are
some troubled times. I'd like to show a
picture that puts folks at ease.
Say, Link, do you know about
cherry-blossom trees?{{delay8}} They've got
the prettiest pink flowers.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We actually have a map of them hung up
next to the picture frame.{{delay8}} Did you see it?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Satori Mountain{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}} has one,
and I've heard folks say it's enchanting.
Something really special.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'd love to paint a marvel like that
cherry-blossom tree...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}I'd go paint it if I had time.{{delay8}} But I never do. If only
I saw a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} of it...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}

label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Did you see our stable's map of
cherry-blossom trees?

I think we need a picture of a cherry-
blossom tree to put next to it. That would
really put customers at ease.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I bet the {{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}} to the
{{color id="0"}}northwest {{color id="-1"}}on {{color id="0"}}Satori Mountain{{color id="-1"}} would
make for a nice painting!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's supposed to be absolutely

label: Com_Photo_05

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Just a picture would do. If I had some kind
of reference for {{color id="0"}}a cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}},
I could paint a copy.

label: Com_Photo_06

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I was hoping to see {{color id="0"}}a picture of a

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I knew this would make a great picture!{{delay8}}
It's just as heartwarming as I imagined.

I'd paint myself a new copy of a
{{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}} anytime you
want to bring one in.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So, if you think another painting of the
blossoms will look better, just show me
a new picture.

label: Com_Photo_08

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The petals have such a delicate color.
I can hardly believe something that lovely

warm in my very soul.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Thanks to you, Link, this painting

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} did you want to do something

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Oh,{{delay8}} I find myself so captivated by that
painting of the cherry-blossom tree.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It really captures the warm, inviting hue of
the cherry-blossom petals. {{delay8}}So beautiful!
