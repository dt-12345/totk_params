I don't think I'll ever find a bed that's as
comfortable as the stone slab in the Ring
Ruins. It's so cool and comfortable.
I may never be able to sleep on a regular
bed—no matter how soft—ever again.

What should I do? Guess I'll sleep on it
and figure it out later.

Monsters appeared at the Ring Ruin out
among the hills that lead west of here,
disrupting my research.
Is anyone out there capable of dealing
with something like this?

I'm not from the village, so I hope it's OK
for me to ask.

The Cuccos used to lay their eggs in front
of the store, but they've been wandering
off somewhere in the mornings.
So where are those dang Cuccos laying
their eggs?

We rely on those eggs for our business.

The secret base is a secret just between
me and mommy!

So no one is allowed to follow me ever!
That's what makes it secret!
