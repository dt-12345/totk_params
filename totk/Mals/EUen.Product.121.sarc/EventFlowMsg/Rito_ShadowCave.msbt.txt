Now where was it again?

label: Talk01_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay15}}That cave...where was it again?{{delay15}}
Oh, hello.

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! {{delay15}}If it isn't the guy who worked with
Tulin to save the village.{{pageBreak}}Everyone in the village is happy to stretch
their wings again without them icing over.{{delay8}}
So thanks for that.{{pageBreak}}And the end of the blizzard has improved
visibility too. {{delay8}}It's much easier now to find
{{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} where we can gather food!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I saw one just the other day, in fact, while
I was flying around...{{delay15}}but I forgot exactly
where it was.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It had a {{color id="0"}}rock wreathed in green light{{color id="-1"}}
inside it, just like the one beneath the
general store.{{pageBreak}}Just where did I see that {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}, anyway?{{delay8}}
I found it while I was looking for that
{{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk02_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there! {{delay15}}I still haven't figured out where
I saw that {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} the other day...

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yeah...there were mushrooms in it and
a pond with fish. It would've been the
perfect place to stock up on supplies.{{pageBreak}}All I remember is that I found it while
looking for that {{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Where was that cave?

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Over there? No, I don't think that was it.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmmm. This is frustrating.

---
label: 0001
---
There was a white bird?

---
label: 0008
---
Tell me about the bird.

---
label: Talk03_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah. {{delay15}}Have you ever looked up at the
peak of the spire here in Rito Village?

---
label: Talk03_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sure. I don't mind telling the story again.{{delay15}}
I found that cave while looking for a
{{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That bit jutting out sideways looks kind
of like a bird's perch, right? {{delay8}}We call it
{{color id="0"}}Vah Medoh's perch{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk03_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I told you about how the peak of the spire
the village is built around is called {{color id="0"}}Vah
Medoh's perch{{color id="-1"}}, right?

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Part of my morning routine is to head up
there and bask in the sun as it rises.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}That day, I was getting some sun up on
the perch, same as always, just when the
{{color id="0"}}dawn was breaking{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Right about then...{{delay15}}I looked to the west
and saw a {{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}} resting atop the {{color id="0"}}long
shadow of the perch{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk04_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}It's weird for a bird to rest on a shadow,
right? {{delay15}}I was curious, so I went to go have
a look where I saw the bird.{{pageBreak}}Thing is, I couldn't find the white bird
again after that. Instead, I found a
{{color id="0"}}cave entrance{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It's kind of like the {{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}} led me to
that {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I don't know why I can remember all that
so clearly, but not where the cave was...

---
label: Talk04_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}When I happened to look west while up on
that perch, basking in the sun at dawn...{{pageBreak}}I saw a single {{color id="0"}}white bird{{color id="-1"}} resting atop the
{{color id="0"}}long shadow of the perch{{color id="-1"}} caused by the
angle of the morning sun.

---
label: Talk04_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}After I was done sunning, I went to have
a look at the {{color id="0"}}bird{{color id="-1"}}, but it wasn't there
anymore. {{delay15}}There was just a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} entrance.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}The white bird was nice enough to lead
me to that cave, so it's frustrating that
I can't remember where it was now.

label: 0002
---
Any standout details?

---
label: Talk06_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}Was there anything that stood out?
Let me think...

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I was lucky to find it. I don't think the
area around the entrance was anything
special or memorable.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But it was {{color id="0"}}right next to a resting white
bird{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}That much, I do remember.{{pageBreak}}Deep inside, I could make out a {{color id="0"}}rock{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}wreathed in green light{{color id="-1"}} like the one
that's beneath the general store now.

---
label: 0003

I hope you find it.

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Ugh. If I could just remember where I
found it, we'd have one more place to
search for food.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Yeah! That's the cave, all right! So you
found it on your own, huh?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I remembered that it was near where I saw
the bird from the peak of Rito Village, on
the tip of Vah Medoh's perch's shadow...{{pageBreak}}But I'd never have found it again without
your help, so I appreciate you telling me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Maybe I'll check it out soon to see what
kind of food we can scrounge there. {{delay15}}I bet
Bedoli would like to come along.
