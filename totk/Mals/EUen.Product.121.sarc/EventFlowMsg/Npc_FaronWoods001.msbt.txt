That's a splendid horse.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, hello. Mind if I ask you about
something that's troubled my thoughts?

Have you, perchance, seen a rather
{{color id="0"}}strange animal {{color id="-1"}}around here?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, hello. Mind if I ask you about that

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I wonder if you've happened to see it...
That {{color id="0"}}strange animal{{color id="-1"}}...

label: Talk1008

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Also, I've heard the {{color id="0"}}sound of a
flute {{color id="-1"}}somewhere...{{delay8}}

It's vexing, really. Not knowing where
that's coming from.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}And did you, perchance, find out where
the {{color id="0"}}sound of a flute{{color id="-1"}} is coming from?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}That's right. It was a stocky animal that
was wider than a horse and had strange
horns. But not like a cow's or goat's!
Oh, and it had tusks that made the beast
look like a little brute!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}I saw the animal once in the {{color id="0"}}forest{{color id="-1"}} off to
the east. I rushed closer to get a good
look, but it ran off by the time I got there.
I'd never seen anything like it. I must say,
the whole experience was shocking.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Some travelers passed through here from
{{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable{{color id="-1"}} and said they'd seen a
similar animal.
So maybe I'll find it again somewhere!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Right... It was a stocky animal that was
wider than a horse. Strange little horns,
too, not like a cow's or goat's.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There were travelers who came from
{{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable{{color id="-1"}} and they said they'd
seen a similar animal.

I think it was a Dondon.

I don't know.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Oh, I didn't know there were animals
called Dondons!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Quite a bouncy bit of a name they have!
Dondon...{{delay8}} Dondon...{{delay8}} I could say that all
day, and maybe I will. {{delay8}}Dondon...
So, Princess Zelda rescued those
creatures and asked Lakeside
Stable to take care of them...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Princess Zelda is very kind.


The stable isn't that far away, so it might
be interesting to see those creatures.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}I'm tempted to bring them something,
but what might Dondons enjoy?

Dondon...{{delay8}} Dondon...{{delay15}} Dondon!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Oh, I see.{{delay8}} That's a shame.


{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}The sight of that strange animal is going
to really trouble my thoughts.

label: Talk1007

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Dondon... Dondon... Oh, what a bouncy
name those animals have.

So, they're under Princess Zelda's
protection and are being cared for at
Lakeside Stable...{{delay8}} 
If you happen to go there to see them for
yourself, take something with you that
they might enjoy.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But what might a Dondon...{{delay8}}Dondon...{{delay8}}
Dondon...{{delay8}}like to eat?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh, I just remembered... While thinking of
that strange animal, I was walking through
the {{color id="0"}}trees on the north side of the stable{{color id="-1"}}.
Out of nowhere, I could hear someone
playing a fun tune on a {{color id="0"}}flute{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But I couldn't see who it was! Not even
the slightest sign of this mysterious
musician. Who was playing? And where?
