You who revived my spirit's four vessels...


Make an offering...


Offer {{color id="0"}}Poes{{color id="-1"}} to me...spirits that ought to
return to the afterlife.

They are pitiful beings who have lost
their way home and wander this land.

I am one who returns all Poes to the
afterlife without prejudice...

Good... Evil... That's the futile perspective
of narrow-minded beings... There is no
such distinction in wandering spirits...
