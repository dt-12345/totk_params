Bugs...aren't food...

I'm working up an appetite.

label: Near_0006

I could use a break.

Hope it clears up soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}You're the one who saved me from that
nasty bout of food poisoning, aren't you?{{delay8}}
Fancy running into you again.
Our mistake was using monster parts in
cooking. They're supposed to be mixed
with bugs to make elixirs.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What were we thinking?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Taking a morning stroll? {{delay8}}It's soothing,
isn't it, the warmth of the morning sun
on your face.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}bugs{{color id="-1"}} can feel the sun on
their faces.

label: Talk_0014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You've more energy than I, going out on
a midday walk. {{delay8}}The sunlight's already
wearing me down.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}bugs{{color id="-1"}} get tired in the sun.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Going on an evening walk? {{delay8}}When the sky
turns deep red like this, I always feel like
doing that too.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}bugs{{color id="-1"}} feel the same way?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Taking a midnight stroll? {{delay8}}I know how
you feel, being drawn out of bed by
the moonlight.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}bugs{{color id="-1"}} look up at the moon.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You've got gumption, taking a walk in
the rain. {{delay8}}As for me, I don't like my clothes
getting squidgy.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}bugs {{color id="-1"}}like the rain, or if they
prefer to stay dry like me.

Bugs?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, sorry. I've got bugs on the mind. I'm
hoping to catch some and mix them with
{{color id="0"}}monster parts {{color id="-1"}}to make a few handy {{color id="0"}}elixirs{{color id="-1"}}.
Bugs blend in with nature, so you can't
always see them at first glance.{{delay15}} But
they're all around us.
Crickets are often lurking in patches of
grass, for instance.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And the bug I'm looking for now, the
rugged rhino beetle, likes to perch on
tree trunks.{{pageBreak}}If you see one, be sure not to make any
sudden movements. {{delay15}}Bugs scare easily!

Be kind and gentle when you catch the
little guys! Do it lovingly!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I will say, they're shyer than usual today.{{delay8}}
Maybe because of all the noise above the
treetops? What is that?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Lots of bugs are nocturnal. {{delay8}}And if you
want to catch a nocturnal creature,
you've gotta be one.
That's why I'm going to bed now—so I can
lay hold of a {{color id="0"}}rugged rhino beetle {{color id="-1"}}tonight!
