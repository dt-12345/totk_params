So they finally did it...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, look at this. You're the one I saw
flying around the sky.

It's great to meet the first one to ever
be launched from a Skyview Tower.
A real historic moment.
Hey, what's your name?

---
label: Talk_0027

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Link, you say?{{delay15}} Hold on there...{{delay8}} Really,
your name is Link?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hey, buddy...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}You've got the same name as that
famous swordsman.{{delay15}} Ha, good for you!{{delay15}}
Pretty big name to live up to though.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm {{color id="0"}}Penn{{color id="-1"}}, by the way. I work for the
{{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}}.

I'm writing an article about this event,
so folks everywhere will know about the
Skyview Towers being activated!
I'd better get to work. Our newspaper is
short on staff, so I've had to flap all over
the place to cover the news.
Hey, we could use another reporter!
You should join us. Seem like a brave
type and all—that's what it takes.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Our newspaper is based in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}} to the
northwest. You'll find it near the bridge
that leads to {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}.
Stop by if you're up for the adventure of
a lifetime...{{delay8}}in the newspaper biz!

Until then...

Which stable first...

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}OK, listen up, partner! We're on the trail
of the truth about Princess Zelda.

We can't let even the smallest clue
slip through our talons. Or hands, in
your case.
We should visit as many stables as we
can. Travelers always have plenty of
goings-on to talk about.

Someday...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hello, partner. {{delay15}}What's going on?{{delay8}}
Starting your day feeling a little lonely?

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello there, partner. {{delay15}}What's up?{{delay15}}
Everyone else is really busy, leaving you
feeling a little lonely?

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there, partner. {{delay15}}What's up?{{delay15}} Feeling a
little lonely this evening, are you?

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see you're still awake, partner. {{delay15}}Most
folks are sound asleep at this hour.{{delay8}}
What's up?

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello there, partner. {{delay15}}This rain is really
something, isn't it.{{delay15}} Anyway, what's up?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Mmm. I thought there'd be at least some
clue, but there's nothing...

Hmm?

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Mmm. It looks like there's nothing for
us here...

Hmm?

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, hey, partner! I didn't think I'd be
running into you here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Did you hear how well the articles
investigating the rumors of Princess Zelda
did? Apparently folks really enjoyed them.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}To think we were able to reveal the truth
behind those stories...

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You're really missing our time together,
aren't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Those articles investigating the rumors of
Princess Zelda did well, didn't they.
Apparently folks really enjoyed them.
It makes sense to me though! We made a
pretty perfect team.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}We revealed the truth behind a lot of
rumors, partner.

It was thanks to you!

---
label: 0001

It was thanks to me!

---
label: 0002
---
We make a great team!

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Hahaha! You think so too, partner?


My zeal for the truth behind a story is
what got us to the answers, that's
for sure!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Heh, aw... Who are we kidding?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We both know that you were the one who
did most of the heavy lifting, partner!

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yeah, you're not wrong about that.
You gave it so much effort that it really
put the wind under our wings.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You really did.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Then again,{{delay8}} how far could you have
gotten without the chirps and warbles
I got from my sources?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So maybe I deserve a fair share of the
credit here...

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}True enough. You're not wrong.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But how far could you have gotten if I
didn't share the chirps and warbles from
my sources? Worth a thought.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Right, well... Maybe it's not my place to
say, but I think we made a great team.
Our first time working together too!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}That's the right way to look at it anyway.
But I'll also say...{{pageBreak}}On any given story, whoever did the
earliest talking with sources probably
gets the most credit for wrapping it up.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, which of us was the most helpful
one here?

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Nice of you to keep saying that. But look,
you need to see it from this angle...

On any given story, whoever got the
first questions in with our sources maybe
gets the most credit for where we got.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, which of us was the most
essential here?

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Without you, I wouldn't have gotten all
the facts for our stories. Hard to look at
myself in the mirror, realizing that.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It'll be good for me to relax in this place.
A famous bard perfected his craft here,
studying the songs of this land.
Besides, our editor, Traysi...{{delay8}} She told me
to take some time off.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'll stay right here and look out across the
land, just like that bard. I'll get in touch
with my reporting instincts!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination"}}Then you bet I'll get my talons on a huge
scoop that will knock you flat on your
tail feathers, partner. You just wait!

label: Talk_0009

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A famous bard once perfected his craft in
this place, studying the songs of this land.

I'll stay right here, just like him, and look
out across the land. I'll get in touch with
my reporting instincts!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination"}}You know that I'll be back in action
someday, partner. One half of a great
team—just wait and see!

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So...I'll leave that froggy armor with
you for now.{{delay15}}

...{{delay15}}


{{anim type="LaughS"}}What, you think it wouldn't fit me?


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Don't you worry! I could squeeze into
that anytime.
