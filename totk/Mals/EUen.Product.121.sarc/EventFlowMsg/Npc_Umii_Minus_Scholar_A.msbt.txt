{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Ah! {{delay15}}I didn't think we'd see anybody
else down here!{{pageBreak}}Though I imagine you could say the same
to us, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, hey, I thought we were the only ones
down he—{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Er,{{delay8}} wait, no.{{delay8}} I mean...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Uhhh...{{delay8}} You're here to investigate too,
right? {{delay8}}Y'know, {{delay8}}since you took the Yi—{{delay8}} Er,
I mean, the survey-team interview?
Because we definitely took that interview
too. That's why we're here. Yep...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Oh, uh, take a look at this! {{delay15}}Our latest
discovery nearly knocked us off our feet.

We found this weird device with these
wavering green letters on it, and this
{{color id="0"}}strange statue{{color id="-1"}}!
We think it's one of those living stone
{{color id="0"}}constructs{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}Pretty sure it's supposed to
move too.
Well, I say that...{{delay8}}but it's all just conjecture
on my part.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Truth is, we're in a bit of a panic here.
If we don't figure out how this thing works
soon, we're going to be in big trouble.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}strange statue{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} It's got to be a
{{color id="0"}}construct{{color id="-1"}}, no doubt about it.

I think it's supposed to move...{{delay8}}but how
do we wake it up?
