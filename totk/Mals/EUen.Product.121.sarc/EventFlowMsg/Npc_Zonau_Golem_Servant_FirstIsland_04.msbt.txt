{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I recommend using {{color id="0"}}flint{{color id="-1"}} as a fire starter.{{pageBreak}}Place {{color id="0"}}flint{{color id="-1"}} next to a bundle of wood.{{delay8}} Then
strike it with a metallic or stony weapon.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can cook anytime and anywhere.
All you need is a pot with a lit {{color id="0"}}fire{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}One method of cooking is simply to throw
random ingredients into the pot.{{pageBreak}}Others are more careful. This is the best
way to make meals that can warm you up.
Other {{color id="0"}}effects{{color id="-1"}} are also possible.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Insects and monster parts are not edible.
Do not cook horns or guts with food.
Save these parts as materials for {{color id="0"}}elixirs{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Elixirs are also helpful in the mountains.{{delay8}}
They are an alternate way to {{color id="0"}}warm {{color id="-1"}}your
body or {{color id="0"}}recover stamina{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The first step in all cases is to start a {{color id="0"}}fire{{color id="-1"}}.
