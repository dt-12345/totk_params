{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm waiting for Tulin. We were supposed
to go looking for food together, but he's
running late.{{pageBreak}}Probably still getting ready at {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}.
I can wait a little longer.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It's past time for us to get to work.
Could Tulin still be at {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Nothing to do but keep waiting, I guess.

Tulin...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's not that Tulin is untalented.
Far from it.{{pageBreak}}Everyone admires his {{color id="0"}}ability to generate
his own gusts{{color id="-1"}}. No one else in the village
can do anything like it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The problem is he knows he's talented,
and it makes him headstrong and prone
to acting rashly. His youth doesn't help.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}But I shouldn't be standing around talking
to passing travelers about this.{{pageBreak}}I need to report this to Harth so we can
discuss what to do about it.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If you're going after Tulin, you'll want to
head into that cave.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I think you'll find him near the {{color id="0"}}lone cedar{{color id="-1"}}
on {{color id="0"}}Talonto Peak{{color id="-1"}}. It's visible to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}
after you leave the cave.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I hope he's not up to anything reckless.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Our investigations haven't revealed what's
above those clouds. You should be ready
for anything before you head out.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We have no way of knowing what we'll
find above those clouds...{{pageBreak}}If I was going up there, I'd make sure
I was prepared for the worst.

repaired. There are bright days ahead

that travelers can cross without fear!{{pageBreak}}Thank you for all you've done.
