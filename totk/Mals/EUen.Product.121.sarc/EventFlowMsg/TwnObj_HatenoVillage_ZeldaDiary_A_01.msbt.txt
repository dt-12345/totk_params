After the Calamity, I asked myself how to
rebuild, and set out across Hyrule in
search of an answer.{{pageBreak}}I saw collapsed buildings, lost cities...
The damage was far worse than I had
imagined.{{pageBreak}}But as I watched the people and heard
their stories, I was convinced all was
not lost.{{pageBreak}}The people's spirits were not broken.
They and their strong wills are Hyrule's
greatest treasure.{{pageBreak}}They are the ones who will rebuild, and
my contribution to their efforts will be to
protect them while they do so.

As part of Hyrule's reconstruction, we've
built a school in Hateno Village.{{pageBreak}}It's the largest Hylian village, with its
sprawling, bountiful land.{{pageBreak}}There are so many children living here
that it seemed the ideal place to found
a school.{{pageBreak}}I've recruited Symin from the research
institute to teach there.{{pageBreak}}He was Purah's assistant for years, which
makes him well-equipped to deal with the
needs of quirky children.{{pageBreak}}I'll be overseeing the school for a while
myself to keep an eye on the students.

I commissioned Bolson, who taught his
trade to Hudson of Hudson Construction,
to construct the school for us.{{pageBreak}}He seemed deeply moved by the request.
This will be his final job in Hateno Village
before he sets off on a journey.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}I had him add a secret room to my house—one that
won't appear on the plans. It's dim but humidity-
and temperature-controlled, so it's very comfortable.{{pageBreak}}It's proven very useful when I'm working alone and
need to concentrate.{{size value="100"}}

Work on the school has been moving
along smoothly, but a major problem
recently reared its head.{{pageBreak}}We don't have enough teachers. Symin
is interviewing people, but he hasn't
found a good fit yet.{{pageBreak}}I'd like to hire someone intelligent,
educated, and capable of earning the
children's trust.{{pageBreak}}Nurturing our children is an extension of
our duty to this land. We shape our future
by the way we shape their path.{{pageBreak}}I hope to see sterling members of our
community come to this village and take
up that mantle as their teacher.
