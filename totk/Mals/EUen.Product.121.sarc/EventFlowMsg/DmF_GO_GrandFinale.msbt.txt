{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I can hardly believe ya, makin' me worry
like that. I oughta—

label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Please don't be mad at President Yunobo.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It's OK, Slergo. I'm the one who made
such a mess of things, after all.

If I had just been more careful...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You said you'd put Goron City back to
normal, and you did!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You're the hero of Goron City! You were
when you made YunoboCo,{{delay15}} and you still
are now!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I... I...{{delay15}} Thank you, goro.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}And we have to thank you, too, Link.


You got rid of the marbled rock roast, and
smiles are coming back to Goron City.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I keep imagining what might've happened
if you hadn't broken that mask...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ugh, no! I can't even think about it.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_7
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Princess Zelda wasn't angry we ruined the
mask, was she?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Actually, we weren't able to catch up
with her.

It was all so strange...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Now that I think about it, it seemed like
she was walking toward that giant
monster by choice.
After that, we didn't see her again.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}President Yunobo...


Do you think that maybe Princess Zelda is
one of the bad guys?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}What do you mean?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_1_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Like maybe the giant monster was
pretending to be Princess Zelda?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}No way!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Hang on.{{delay8}} Come to think of it,{{delay8}} my ancestor
was talking about the Sage of Time...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}And that sage looked a whole lot like
Princess Zelda. Maybe she's the
real Zelda!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But my ancestor was alive a really, really
long time ago. So...that can't quite be it.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Then that means the Princess Zelda we
were following WAS the real one!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Except she was doing a bunch of bad
stuff... Maybe you're right, Offrak.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_27

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Real or not, we need to find Princess
Zelda and ask her ourselves!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}No way!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}And that sage looked a whole lot like
Princess Zelda. So maybe she IS the
real Zelda!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But my ancestor lived a really, really long
time ago. So...that would be weird.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}But! If that IS true, then that means...that
WAS the real Zelda we were following!

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_33
---
My ancestor said... But that was so
long ago...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_34
---
And Princess Zelda?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_35
---
Could she have been the real one?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_36
---
Or not?

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_37
---
Or MAYBE...

my ancestor referred to as the Sage
of Time...

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_42

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}She said she wanted to help the
swordsman Link. Now that I think about
it, that was definitely Princess Zelda!

the past...

Princess Zelda we saw was an impostor!

label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_45

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}And that impostor is making a bad name
for our Princess Zelda! That's no good!

'em, goro!

the area around the city for any leads

not go diggin' up any more weird rocks.

Ya got that, President Yunobo?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey, Link, you haven't been to Lookout
Landing yet, have you?

They should be searching for Princess
Zelda and investigating the Upheaval.

It might be a good idea to go there. It's
just south of Hyrule Castle.

---
label: DmF_GO_GrandFinale_2_15

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey, Link.


You've visited Rito Village, Zora's Domain,
and Gerudo Town.

You've gathered a lot of info by now.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Why don't you go back and report it all
to Purah? I'm sure she's eagerly waiting
for you.

You've visited Rito Village, Zora's Domain,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You've gathered a lot of info by now.
You should go talk to the folks at
Lookout Landing about what you know.
It's just south of Hyrule Castle.
