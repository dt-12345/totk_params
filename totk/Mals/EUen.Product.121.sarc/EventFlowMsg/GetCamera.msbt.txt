I gotta find Goggles!

---
Come on... Please!

---
label: Talk_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Inspiration"}}Sorry, can't talk now!


There's something I gotta discuss with
Goggles right away about our {{color id="0"}}research
into the chasms{{color id="-1"}}.
Let's talk later!

---
label: Talk_63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hey, you—you're actually back! It's been
a long time!

Yeesh, do you have any idea how
worried we've been about you?
Purah told me everything!

---
label: Talk_71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Is it true you've got the Purah Pad?

---
label: Talk_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hey, you! Is it true you've got the
Purah Pad?

---
label: Talk_65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Purah and I worked together on the
design, but I'm the one who put it
together, you know.
We should've called it the Robbie Pad,
technically speaking.

---
label: Talk_69
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, it's you!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You know, that Purah Pad of yours may
seem perfect... {{delay8}}But it could be even
more perfect!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I'll need to head back to the lab when
Josha's got {{color id="0"}}the Depths investigation{{color id="-1"}}
sorted out...

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Purah and I worked together on the
design for the Purah Pad, but I'm the
one who put it together, you know.
We should've called it the Robbie Pad,
technically speaking.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}But Purah went and slapped her own
name on it—grabbing all the glory!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Whatever. It's fine. Anyway, Josha
wanted to talk to me about something.
So I'm waiting for her right now.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Purah asked Josha to {{color id="0"}}research the
chasms{{color id="-1"}}. That's a big mission for such
a young person.
But she's a prodigy, you see. Puts the
rest of us full-grown adults to shame with
all she can do.
{{anim type="Think_01"}}Maybe she's discovered something that
even my imagination couldn't conjure!

---
label: Talk_75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder what Josha wants to talk
to me about.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, she's real young, but despite
that she was asked by Purah to {{color id="0"}}research
the chasms{{color id="-1"}}.
She's a prodigy, you see. Puts the rest of
us full-grown adults to shame with all she
can do.
Maybe she's discovered something that
even my imagination couldn't conjure!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Come ON, Goggles! Are you even listening
to me?

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh! Uh, yes!


Sorry, you were saying?

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I was SAYING that I want {{color id="0"}}to go investigate
the Depths{{color id="-1"}}!

Look, if you're not gonna listen to me,
I'll go and jump into a {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}myself!

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}No way, no how! You can't do that!


{{color id="0"}}The Depths{{color id="-1"}} are far too vast for you to
explore on your own. And we've only
barely begun to look into them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd love to go gallivanting around down
there too—who knows what wonders
are at the bottom of those chasms!
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But no matter how wondrous they may be,
it's far too dangerous for you.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}I'm not about to allow our young prodigy
to go wandering around somewhere so
unknown, so foul!
If anything were to happen to Purah's
favorite student, it'd be the end for me!{{delay8}}
The END!

---
label: Talk_67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}But I need more on that {{color id="0"}}figure{{color id="-1"}}! If we have
more info on it, then it should help us
better understand {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 0005
---
What figure?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh, Swordsman! Sorry, I didn't mean to
leave you out of the conversation.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_03"}}Let me get you up to speed.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Our survey team brought back some
artifacts from a journey into {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.
One of them caught my eye.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This piece of slate. Specifically, the image
depicted on it.

{{anim type="Think_01"}}See that figure standing on two legs with
one arm raised up?

Well...{{delay8}}I have a theory.


I think it could be evidence that a
mysterious people once lived in
the Depths.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_02"}}That's why I want to go {{color id="0"}}down there{{color id="-1"}}—so I
can see if there are any more depictions
like this one. I want to see for myself!

---
label: Talk_68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But Goggles here says it's too dangerous,
and he won't let me go.

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Josha, come on now...{{delay15}}


Tell you what. I'll go down there myself
and see if I can't find anything about the
{{color id="0"}}figure{{color id="-1"}} on that {{color id="0"}}slate{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And Link will join me!

---
label: Talk_93
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Though there's been a sighting of the
{{color id="0"}}princess{{color id="-1"}} at the castle—allegedly—I know
searching there will prove fruitless!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}The Depths{{color id="-1"}} must hold the secret to her
location. We must continue our
investigations there.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Besides, Purah said she's in charge of
the castle investigation...

So, the Depths require our continued
attention!

---
label: Talk_94
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll need you to take your Purah Pad
down there to get a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} of anything
we may find that resembles the {{color id="0"}}figure{{color id="-1"}}.
The {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} feature should make that
easy. Then we'll bring it back here
to Josha!

---
label: Talk_52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We'll start by looking for {{color id="0"}}anything down
there that resembles the figure on
the slate{{color id="-1"}}.
Assuming we find what we're looking for,
we'll use your Purah Pad's {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} to take
a picture of it for Josha.{{delay15}} A perfect plan!

---
label: 0001
---
Camera?

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You don't know about the {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}? It's
one of the Purah Pad's basic features!

With the {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}, you can capture nearby
scenery as an image—one that's stored
in your pad there!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sounds like you still have more to learn
about the Purah Pad...

Well then, I'll teach you {{color id="0"}}how to take
pictures{{color id="-1"}}. Once we're down there, anyway.

There will be lots of monsters in {{color id="0"}}the
Depths{{color id="-1"}} though. So I'll be counting
on you to keep me safe.

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Let's see...{{delay15}} I guess we should enter
through the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} of
Lookout Landing.
I'll go on ahead. Once you're ready and
rarin' to go, come find me there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ta-ta!

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait, hang on!

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Looks like{{delay8}} he's gone...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm sorry you got roped into all of
this, Swordsman.

Goggles means well... But when he wants
to help me, he leaps before he looks.

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_03"}}But here, maybe this will help you out,
at least.

---
label: Talk_86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We've set aside supplies for the Depths,
and you'll need to prepare, after all.

---
label: Talk_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, and take this too.

---
label: Talk_62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_03"}}The {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}} are pretty deep, so light from
the surface doesn't make it down there.
It's pitch black!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But if you attach a {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seed {{color id="-1"}}to an
arrow and shoot it, it'll light up the area.
Definitely a useful trick down there!

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK, you'll want to head straight out of
Lookout Landing's {{color id="0"}}southern gate{{color id="-1"}}. You'll
find the chasm Goggles used just outside.
I don't know too much about how your
{{color id="0"}}camera {{color id="-1"}}works...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}But I'm counting on you to bring me that
{{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}}. Oh, and please look after {{color id="0"}}Goggles{{color id="-1"}}
for me!

---
label: Talk_92
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I heard something about a potential
sighting of {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} at the castle...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I need to stay focused on my research
into {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.

That's where I'm sure we'll find a real clue
about what's happened to the princess!

---
label: Near201
---
How far did Robbie go?

---
label: Talk_201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Are you Link?


Pleasure to meet you. I am Ponnick, from
the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}}.

{{color id="0"}}Robbie{{color id="-1"}} told me to guide you to him once
you arrived.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But he rushed along with such haste that
I didn't bring enough {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}},
and now I've run out.
So I lost sight of him...

---
label: Talk_206
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Robbie{{color id="-1"}} told me to guide you to him once
you arrived.

But he rushed along with such haste that
I didn't bring enough {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}}.

So I lost sight of him...

---
label: Talk_204
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I thought he was taking a short walk over
to that {{color id="0"}}glowing area {{color id="-1"}}over there.

---
label: Talk_207
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then he just kept going...

---
label: Talk_208
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}and going...


And last I saw him, he was heading way
out there, off to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you have any {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}}
with you?

---
label: 0006
---
I do.

---
label: 0007
---
I don't.

---
label: Talk_203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, that's great news. Light from the
surface doesn't reach down here, as you
might have noticed.
You'd be risking your life to wander here
without a light source, you know.

You can easily get brightbloom seeds
from {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}, and they'll {{color id="0"}}light up if struck{{color id="-1"}},
so they're pretty easy to use too.
We use the seeds all the time on the
Zonai Survey Team. The simplest way is
to {{color id="0"}}throw them with your hand{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_209
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those of us skilled enough with a bow will
attach them to {{color id="0"}}arrows{{color id="-1"}} and fire them off
into the distance down here.

---
label: Talk_210
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Although, this time, Robbie grabbed me in
such a rush that I didn't gather enough
in advance...

---
label: Talk_202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Oh, that's no good at all. Light from the
surface doesn't reach down here, as you
might have noticed.
It's incredibly dangerous to explore here
without a light source.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You can easily get brightbloom seeds
from {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}, and they'll {{color id="0"}}light up if struck{{color id="-1"}},

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're going to explore the Depths, take
plenty of those seeds with you.

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?!


Look at how bright that thing got!
That light down in this dark is
downright refreshing.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hm...{{delay15}} In fact, it's so luminous, it's
almost like...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Like we're on the surface!


Just standing near it makes {{color id="0"}}me feel so
much better{{color id="-1"}}. How strange.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, it's you! You're finally here!


I need to show you what I've found.

---
label: Talk_81
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Now, let's get a better look at this thing!

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hey, you! You're finally here!


Take a look at this.

---
label: Talk_80
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I won't be able to show you what I've
discovered with it this dark.

---
label: Talk_83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If only that huge, glowing root was
providing more light...

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}This statue...{{delay8}} It's standing tall on two
legs, one arm raised high...

It looks an awful lot like the figure Josha
showed us on that piece of slate, don't
you think?

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can barely make it out, but this
{{color id="0"}}statue {{color id="-1"}}here...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's standing tall on two legs, one arm
raised high...

It looks an awful lot like the figure Josha
showed us on that piece of slate, don't
you think?

---
label: Talk_90
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Even if it is, it's too dang dark!

---
label: Talk_84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}If only that huge, glowing root could give
off more light!

---
label: Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All right! Get that {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} of yours ready. 
It's time to put it to work.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's right! I forgot you hadn't used
the {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} when we last spoke.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Very curious indeed, given it's one of
the Purah Pad's basic features.

Hmm...{{delay8}} Give me that Purah Pad for a
second, all right?

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Well! There's the problem!


Your {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} is locked. And so's your
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Compendium{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hang on.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}If I remember correctly... You press this while you
pull this, and then you tap that, and...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{size value="125"}}Boom.{{size value="100"}}


Now you should be able to use both the
{{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} and your {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Compendium{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So! Go capture a {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}of that statue!
This is a good chance to verify that it's
working properly too.
Test it out. Experience is the best teacher,
after all!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Once you've captured the image, come
back here. I'll want to see how it looks.

---
label: Near_05
---
Use your camera!

---
label: Talk_60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So? Did you get a good {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I'm sure this statue is like the figure on
that fragment Josha has. This may even
BE what it's showing.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Use the {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} to capture an image of it.
Oh! When you take the picture, your view
has to be just right...{{delay8}}to be perfect.
You'll make Josha very happy if you
bring back a great image.

Test it out. Experience really is the
best teacher!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Once you've captured the image, come
back here. I'll want to see how it looks.

All right, then. Let's see it.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{size value="125"}}Stupendous!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Looks like you've captured it well. I'm
sure Josha will be satisfied with this.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Lighting up that immense root...{{delay8}} Getting
us a picture of the statue...

You've just started helping us research
what's down here, but soon enough we're
going to have even more to investigate.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well then, it's time I head back up to
the surface.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}See you at {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}. Don't make

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}HEY! What's the matter?

---
label: Talk_89

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}statue{{color id="-1"}} is right there! It's just like the
figure on that fragment Josha has.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This may even BE what it's showing.
In fact, I'm almost certain of it!

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So, capture an image of the statue with
your {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}, and then show it to me!

label: Talk_54

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can find the chasm that Goggles
headed for by going straight out of
Lookout Landing's {{color id="0"}}southern gate{{color id="-1"}}.
I think he plans to enter {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}
from there.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Sorry I can't tell you anything about how
that {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} works. I just know it captures

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So if you find a {{color id="0"}}figure {{color id="-1"}}down there that

Just like on the slate, this figure must be
