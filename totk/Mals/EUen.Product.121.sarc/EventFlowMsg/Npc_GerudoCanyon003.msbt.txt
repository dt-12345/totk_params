{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, hello again, my enduring friend! It's
been some time since our fateful match.{{pageBreak}}In the time since, I have been traveling
from place to place in the hopes that I
may reforge myself.
That's when I met some like-minded
folks—the two throwing punches
on the cliff over there.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Though it pains me to say it, I...cannot
keep up with them.{{pageBreak}}Day or night, rain or shine, nothing stops
their endless barrage of punches.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But that just means I have room yet to
grow! There's always someone better out
there, so I must never stop training!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, it's you! You have been diligent in
your training, I hope?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}No matter how hard I try, I cannot keep
up with my constantly punching friends
on the cliff over there.
So I've taken it upon myself to stand
guard here.{{delay8}} It's all I'm good for, anyway...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I once thought that none could best me
in matters of endurance.{{pageBreak}}But between you defeating me twice over
and my friends on the cliff, I have learned
how vast the world truly is.
Perhaps this is a sign that I must redouble
my training efforts...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, you again! I trust you've been keeping
up with your training?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}My friends continue to throw punches
up on that cliff, undeterred by the rain...{{pageBreak}}Meanwhile, my limited punching capacity
has consigned me to guard duty.
Ugh, I'm so ashamed of myself...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'd like to have their unflinching focus
someday, but for now, I've no choice but
to endure...guard duty.
