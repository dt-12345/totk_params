Ack, rain in my eye!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, I remember you... What are you up to
this early?

label: Talk_Greeting0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, I remember you... What are you up
to today?

label: Talk_Greeting0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, I remember you... What are you doing
out so late?

---
label: Talk_Greeting0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? What are you doing out in rain
like this?

---
label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hm? Did Purah send you? I'm Saguru.
Nice to meet you. I specialize in studying
the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.
I mean, look at all of these fascinating
ruins just dropping out of the sky!{{delay15}} Great
stuff, right?
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh?{{delay15}} Wait, you're not with the
survey team!

This is an official Ring Ruins research site.
It's dangerous here for civilians.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}But if you're the sort of guy who comes
all the way out here for curiosity's sake,
you must be a researcher at heart.
Since you're here, I'm happy to answer
questions. Um, as long as they're about
the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This is an official Ring Ruins investigation
site... {{delay15}}And it IS dangerous for civilians...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}But I respect your curiosity.


Since you came all the way out, I'll answer
any of your questions. Um, as long as
they're about the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What admirable curiosity! Do you have
any questions about the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}?
They're my specialty.
If I'm honest, I don't know much about
anything else.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'm not boring you, am I?


Because I can go on about the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}
forever! Go ahead, ask me anything!

What are sky islands?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know when you start daydreaming
and stare off into the sky? And then you
go, "whoa, a floating ruin?!"
That's a sky island.


{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Remnants of the Zonai civilization, like
these {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, have fallen all over.
Turns out they come from the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Which means...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}The whole Zonai legacy is up there! The
islands are untouched, so everything must
be well-preserved.

label: 0017
---
Anything live up there?

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We're not sure what lives up there, but
we've found new species of plants around
the fallen ruins.
And if there are plants, I'm sure other
things live up there too.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}If you're interested in that sort of thing...

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Try talking to {{color id="0"}}Cori{{color id="-1"}}. She's our resident
plant expert.

Right now she's trying to {{color id="0"}}cultivate plants{{color id="-1"}}
that were attached to the ruins.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If that interests you, you should definitely
ask her about it.

---
label: 0018
---
What makes you curious?

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm...{{delay15}} I want to know more about {{color id="0"}}armor{{color id="-1"}}
made with Zonai tech.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Clothing and culture are tied together,
and there's so much we don't know about
either of them. So many mysteries...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Anyway, the {{color id="0"}}bigger the sky island{{color id="-1"}}, the
bigger the settlements. We think some
sort of {{color id="0"}}cultural relic {{color id="-1"}}must be up there.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}But since we can't get up there, it's all
conjecture. I'll have to content myself
studying the Ring Ruins.

Goodbye.

label: Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We don't have a way to get to the {{color id="0"}}sky
islands{{color id="-1"}}. At least, not YET! I'd love to
go someday.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I bet the folks in Tarrey Town could improve the
balloon. I wish I had a reason to head northeast...{{size value="100"}}
