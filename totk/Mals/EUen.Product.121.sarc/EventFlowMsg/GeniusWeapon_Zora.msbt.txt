So, you have come...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Link.{{delay15}} Once again, {{delay8}}you have done Zora's
Domain a great service.

Thanks to the efforts of you and our
young King Sidon, the domain has been
saved.{{delay15}} You must allow me to thank you.

{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Link.{{delay15}} If you intend to go up against the
various phenomena plaguing this world,
you need a weapon that is up to the task.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}} has been passed
down through generations of the Zora
since ancient times. {{delay15}}It will not fail you.
Bring me the necessary materials and I
will craft one for you with all due haste.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You must acquire a Zora spear, three
diamonds, and five pieces of flint.

Even a {{color id="0"}}Zora spear{{color id="-1"}} that is decayed
will suffice.

label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Do you have the required materials?{{delay8}}
If so, I will get to work.

I want that trident.

Not right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}With a Zora spear, three diamonds,
and five pieces of flint,{{delay8}} I can craft
you the {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}}.
Return when you have what is needed.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Link.{{delay8}} Thank you for coming.

label: talk0002_01

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Will you be able to gather the required
materials for the {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}}
Here is what you must procure...

---
label: talk0011
---
{{color id="0"}}Diamonds{{color id="-1"}}... You need {{color id="0"}}three {{color id="-1"}}of them.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{color id="0"}}Flint{{color id="-1"}}... You need {{color id="0"}}five pieces{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0013
---
One {{color id="0"}}Zora spear{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} Even a decayed one
will suffice.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Return to me when you have the required
materials.{{delay8}} I will be waiting.

label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I do not have any hesitation helping the
hero who saved the domain.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}I require a Zora spear, three diamonds,{{delay8}}
and five pieces of flint.{{delay8}} With those, I can
craft you the {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}}.

I want that trident.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You have acquired all of the materials! 


This will not take long...

---
label: talk0004_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You acquired the necessary materials.
However...{{pageBreak}}That {{color id="0"}}Zora spear{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}has been altered in
some way.

I cannot craft the {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}} using
an impure Zora spear.

---
label: talk0004_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If it were decayed, that would be no
matter. {{delay8}}However, I require a Zora spear
that has not been altered in any way.
You can remove the addition yourself,
of course. However, {{delay8}}know that it would
not survive the process.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I hear there is someone in {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}},
up in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}} to the north, who can remove
items used to alter weapons.
You should perhaps pay them a visit...and
have them remove the item haphazardly
attached to your spear.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The Lightscale Trident...{{delay8}} I am entrusting
it to you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If it becomes broken or lost, or if it has
otherwise disappeared from this world,{{delay8}}
I will remake it for you.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hm. I sense that the Lightscale Trident
has not been lost to this world.

If that changes, return and I will remake it
for you.
