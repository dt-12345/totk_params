{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}That outfit... {{delay8}}It would be best if the guards
didn't see you dressed that way.

But besides that...

Hm.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}The desert may be a warm place, but I
would really appreciate it if you'd wear
a little bit more clothing, OK?
But besides that...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I was...not expecting a voe to suddenly
appear right before my eyes. Nearly made
me jump out of my skin!
I should thank you though. I had a crick
in my back, but the shock of your arrival
seems to have fixed it!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}My husband is a Hylian voe too. Imagine
if he'd been the one suddenly appearing!
But obviously he isn't allowed into town...
Since it is customary for Gerudo to return
to town at a certain age, our daughter
and I moved back here...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I warned my husband—several times—that
voe were not allowed inside the town and
were sometimes jailed, but...
Well, he insisted on traveling with us all
the way here, and I saw him eyeing the
town walls when we parted ways.
{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Wabbin... I wonder what you're up to right now...{{delay15}}{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Anyway, once you're done shopping,
you'd better get out of town before any
of the guards catch you.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh, you're back? I'm surprised the guards
haven't found you. Normally they're pretty
good at catching intruders...
Usually when a voe tries to sneak into
town, he's quickly caught by the guards
and thrown into {{color id="0"}}jail{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I won't turn you in, of course, but once
you're done shopping, you should get out
of town before the guards find you.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Wow, I see another Hylian voe and all I can think
about is my husband...

Wabbin... What are you up to right now?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry, I forgot an important rule of the
{{color id="0"}}Secret Club{{color id="-1"}}—everyone's business is
their own.
You'll be safe from the guards here, so
feel free to take all the time you need to
look at the things we sell.
