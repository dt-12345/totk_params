{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Babi has been training hard since we fought
the Gibdos.

She's the one who told us that our spears wouldn't
even leave a mark though...{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The only thing that seemed to have any effect at all
was {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}lightning strikes{{color id="-1"}}.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Instead of practicing with our regular spears, should
we be looking for a {{color id="0"}}weapon that has electricity
flowing{{color id="-1"}} through it?{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Maybe, but if we bring it up to her right now, she'll
tell us to pay attention to our own shortcomings!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}And if we're really unlucky, she'll drag both of us
into her intense spear training too!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Lady Riju's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}lightning strikes{{color id="-1"}} worked...


Instead of practicing with spears, maybe
we should be looking for a {{color id="0"}}weapon that
has electricity flowing{{color id="-1"}} through it?

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Shhh, Marta! Keep your voice down!


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}If Babi hears you, then she's gonna tell us that only
martial perfection will help us in battle, and then
make us train more!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}That messenger earlier...{{delay8}} I wonder if it
had anything to do with the Gibdos...

label: Talk29

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I don't know what the message was, but
it was enough for Buliara to head for
{{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.
Something big must be happening...

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}You could be right...


Still, it's amazing—and a bit wild—that
Babi is training so intensely.

I mean, spear attacks didn't even slow
those Gibdo things down.

label: Talk11

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The real fighting is gonna start soon, but
I'm still sore from Babi's scolding and
from all the extra training after that.
She knows that regular spear attacks
won't do anything against the Gibdos.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}We shouldn't be lax about our training,
of course, but I want her to acknowledge
that there's more to a successful battle.
You know, things like {{color id="0"}}gathering intel and
learning an enemy's weaknesses{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Our preparations were perfect!


Now all that's left is to stab, stab, stab!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Your coordination with Lady Riju was
impressive! Not bad for a Hylian voe.

There aren't that many Gerudo who use
a bow and arrow, so you really were
invaluable in the battle!

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Up till now, I've been training extra hard
with the spear with Babi, but...

Maybe it's time we formed a bow-and-
arrow unit.

Once I've finished up polishing this spear,
I think I'll let Babi know that I want to
change directions.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Yup, just gotta finish with this spear, then I'll be
ready... Maybe.{{size value="100"}}
