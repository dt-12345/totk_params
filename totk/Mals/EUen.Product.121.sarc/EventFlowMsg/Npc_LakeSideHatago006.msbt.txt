Oh, a ring garland. Pretty!

Down to the skivvies, hm?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh my! You must have come quite
a long way!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Still, you must have come quite a

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is a sanctuary for {{color id="0"}}Dondons{{color id="-1"}},
the new animal species discovered
by {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.
{{color id="0"}}Dondons {{color id="-1"}}are quite precious, as we've only
found five of their kind in the wild. Please
be gentle if you touch them.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}They might look intimidating, but you've
got nothing to worry about. They're a
good-natured sort.
When the princess came to research
the Dondons, they used to go tromping
around after her wherever she went.
I think they're actually quite fond of us
two-legged folk.

label: Talk_0112
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}That reminds me... {{delay15}}Did you hear that
rumor about Princess Zelda being seen
riding a beast?
Well, I'd bet what people actually saw
was her with a Dondon back when she
established this sanctuary!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It just goes to show how much rumors
can take on a life of their own.{{delay8}} Dondons
aren't beastly. They're adorable.

---
label: Talk_0111
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh my. You've taken an interest in the
Dondons, hm? I don't blame you.

Only five of these little ones have been
found in the world. Few have the chance
to meet them in person.
I promise, strange as they look, they're a
good-natured sort. They used to follow
the princess around like little ducklings.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Oh, and the way she would dote on them!
It was very sweet.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Anyway, they really are gentle. Feel free
to come visit them whenever you find
yourself out here.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}W-{{delay8}}wait!{{delay8}} We'll get wet out here!


If you want to talk, let's talk over there.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh dear, oh dear... Rain comes down
so suddenly here. I hate it.

The Dondons don't seem to mind though.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Eeeyah!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I've hated lightning ever since
I was a child.

But the Dondons, they don't even
flinch at the sound of thunder.
They're unflappable.

label: Talk_0123

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Waaah!

---
label: Talk_0126
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh! {{delay15}}You startled me. I wasn't expecting
to run into anyone in this storm.

---
label: Talk_0125
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}All this thunder and lightning...{{delay15}} It's really
fraying my nerves.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Maybe we should take shelter. Go and
watch the Dondons while we wait out
this storm.

label: Talk_0124

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Ah, sunshine! {{delay8}}I just hope it sticks around.

label: Talk_0130

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Excuse me, but...{{delay15}}you can't take that gem.

---
label: Talk_0131

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That gem is a precious clue to
understanding {{color id="0"}}Dondons{{color id="-1"}}' lives
and habits.

---
label: Talk_0132
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry to repeat myself,{{delay8}} but that gem is a
clue to learning about the lives and habits
of {{color id="0"}}Dondons{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You'll have to bear with me. It's a bit of
a long story.

One day, some {{color id="0"}}luminous stones {{color id="-1"}}I'd
picked up fell out of my bag.

Before I knew it, a {{color id="0"}}Dondon {{color id="-1"}}charged over,
and then...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{size value="125"}}Chomp, chomp!{{size value="100"}}


It gobbled the luminous stones{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}right up!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}These animals show no interest in food...
and then luminous stones, of all things,
spark their hunger? {{delay8}}I was shocked!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}After a while, we found {{color id="0"}}gems{{color id="-1"}} on the
ground where the Dondon grazed.

Those...{{delay8}}are the gems.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Where they came from remains a little
uncertain,{{delay8}} but I think the Dondon created
them after eating the {{color id="0"}}luminous stones{{color id="-1"}}.
If that's the case, I might learn more
about the nature of Dondons by studying
those. So please, don't take them.

---
label: Talk_0134
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I'm sorry.{{delay8}} I can't give you those gems.


But I'm happy to tell you about Dondons,
if you're interested!

---
label: Talk_0135
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Thank you... {{delay8}}And please, be sure to spend
time with the Dondons while you're here.
