{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh... Those {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}} are a nuisance...
They keep attacking us from the cover
of the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
If it weren't for Lady Riju and her
{{color id="0"}}lightning strikes{{color id="-1"}}, we'd have been
wiped out already.
Grrr... We're supposed to be protecting
her, not the other way around. What kind
of guards are we?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Lady Riju hasn't been able to completely
master her {{color id="0"}}control over lightning{{color id="-1"}}... If only
I could do something to help her.
So sore... {{delay15}}I guess I should focus on my
own recovery, but... Ugh, I just feel
so pathetic.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}} may be the core of our fighting
power, but I'm going to do my part! I'll
catch these monsters off guard this time!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The defense of the town isn't just on Lady
Riju's shoulders! We'll all do our part to
keep everyone safe!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Don't let them reach Lady Riju!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's no way to know if they'll be back,
but for now, we've driven them off and
that's a huge victory.
If they come back, I'll stop them from
getting through this gate—with my life,
if I have to!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm protecting this area. I won't let the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, it's you!{{delay8}} Don't worry—you can come
and go as you please.

Now that the sand shroud has cleared up,
you can really appreciate the beauty of
the desert. Just look at that view!{{pageBreak}}When I want to relax, I rent a sand seal
from the {{color id="0"}}rental shop{{color id="-1"}} over there and
explore the desert.
Because of you and the chief, it's safe
to go out and really appreciate the
desert scenery!

seal{{color id="-1"}} from the {{color id="0"}}rental shop{{color id="-1"}}, you can always
try and catch one of them on your own.
But they're very {{color id="0"}}sensitive to sound{{color id="-1"}}. You
have to approach them very quietly.{{size value="80"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Shhhhhh... {{delay15}}Be sneaky!{{size value="100"}}
