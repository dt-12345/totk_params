---
Are you well? You seem a bit distracted.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_002_b
---
I apologize. I keep getting lost in my thoughts,
thinking about how I can return home.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_003_b
---
With your power over time... If I were able to learn
that kind of control...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_004_b
---
I might be one step closer to my era.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_005_b
---
I see...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_006_b
---
The secret is to think of it like drawing out the
object's memory.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_007_b
---
You ask the object where it was, how it arrived where
it is now, and then you coax it back to that original
moment in time.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_010_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_010_b
---
The object's memory...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_011_b
---
I am sure it will become almost like second nature,
and you will be able to find your way home.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_012_b
---
But, Zelda...there is more on your mind than just that.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_013_b
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_014_b
---
You, of course, do want to get back to your time.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_015_b
---
But...you also desperately want to help us out
in this era. Am I close to the truth?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_016_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_016_b
---
How did you know?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_017_b
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_017_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_018_b
---
I do not believe it is possible to keep anything secret
from Sonia.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_019_b
---
Oh, your concern is very sweet, Zelda.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_020_b
---
But listen. You can focus your attention on
returning home.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_021_b
---
After all, you possess more than power over time.
You have a sacred power that can dispel evil.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_022_b
---
Both of these powers will help you protect your
own era.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_023_b
---
Queen Sonia...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_024_b
---
And, of course, you must make it home safe to put
Link's mind at ease.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_025_b
---
Link?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_025_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_026_b
---
That is not a name I have heard.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_027_b
---
He is a royal knight. He had been originally appointed
for my protection. 

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_028_b
---
But later, he became a hero by saving both me and
Hyrule from a great evil!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_029_b
---
Oh? A hero, is he?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_030_b
---
He is so very dedicated. And he refuses to back
down from any challenge.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_031_b
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_032_b
---
He is very strong...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_032_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_033_b
---
And his heart is good and true!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_034_c
---
Ah. I can see that you have absolute faith in him.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_035_c
---
Hearing you speak so highly of Link, I find myself
wanting to meet him as well!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_036_b
---
Indeed.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_037_b
---
I would also like to meet him.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_038_b
---
He must be quite the brave, courageous knight.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_039_b
---
What a picture Zelda paints of him!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0005_Text_040_b
