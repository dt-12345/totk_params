What should I do?

label: talk1002_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Hoo boy, that startled me!{{delay15}} I didn't expect
to see anyone else here...

---
label: talk1002_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey there! {{delay15}}I didn't expect to see anyone
else here.

---
label: talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Did you also come here in search of
treasure after hearing about the
{{color id="0"}}ancient manuscript {{color id="-1"}}from {{color id="0"}}Kodah{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk1065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, is that not it?{{delay8}} Then...you just
happened upon this place. Huh.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'm here with {{color id="0"}}Finley{{color id="-1"}}. She's the best
person I've ever met, so there's no better
person to hunt for treasure with!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Back in Zora's Domain, Finley's mother
{{color id="0"}}Kodah {{color id="-1"}}showed us an {{color id="0"}}ancient manuscript{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You won't believe what it said...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}"Long, long ago, at {{color id="0"}}Tarm Point{{color id="-1"}},
a blessed stone was hidden away
within a sacred {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}}.
"It was a magnificent {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}} that was
overflowing with blessings."{{delay8}} That's what
it said! Or, something like that, at least.

---
label: talk1054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}That's right! {{delay8}}It's an ancient manuscript
left behind by {{color id="0"}}Kodah{{color id="-1"}}'s ancestors.

Since {{color id="0"}}Finley {{color id="-1"}}is Kodah's daughter,
we asked her to tell us all about the
contents of that document.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It said something like, "Long, long ago,
at {{color id="0"}}Tarm Point{{color id="-1"}}, a blessed stone was
hidden away within a sacred {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}}."

---
label: talk1054_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I know it's an ancient manuscript and all,
but the writing...{{delay8}}lacked clarity, if you ask
me.{{delay8}} I was a bit skeptical at first.

---
label: talk1054_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}But come ON! It's a sacred shrine!{{delay15}} If I was
going to hide treasure, that's exactly
where I'd leave it!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Finley was so convinced that she
declared, "Treasure hunt, ahoy!"{{delay8}} Next
thing I knew, she'd left Zora's Domain.
She was so excited—and where Finley
goes, I go. So here I am. We made it all
the way to this cave as a team.

---
label: talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But then Finley swam ahead all by herself
and went {{color id="0"}}deep inside the cave{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}"Don't lag behind!"{{delay8}} she hollered back
at me. Easier said than done, I'm afraid.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Finley thinks I'm capable of anything.
She really is such a sweetheart.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I've been training like mad, but...{{delay8}}
I'm just not a very good swimmer.

---
label: talk1055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I found a perfect little {{color id="0"}}raft {{color id="-1"}}there and
thought maybe I could ride it to her
location.

---
label: talk1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Nope. The water in this cave {{color id="0"}}goes up and
down drastically{{color id="-1"}}, so even if you manage
to get going, you end up on a rock.
That means I have no way forward, so I'm
not sure what to do.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I promised Finley... {{delay8}}"Of course we'll find
the treasure together! Anything for you!"
That's what I said. {{delay8}}Ugh, what should I do?

---
label: near1002
---
Sasan...

---
label: talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}This must be the shrine we heard about
in the ancient manuscript's text... {{delay15}}I had
better wait for {{color id="0"}}Sasan{{color id="-1"}} here.

---
label: talk1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Where is {{color id="0"}}Sasan{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}} We promised each other
that we would find the treasure together...

---
label: near1006
---
{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Over here!

---
label: talk1079
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Tee hee!{{delay8}} Sasan has finally arrived!

---
label: near1003
---
What should I do?

---
label: talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}I wonder if I'm just not trying hard
enough to go deeper into the cave.

---
label: talk1070
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Are you ready to raft, by any chance?

---
label: 0011
---
It's rafting time!

---
label: 0012
---
What's your deal again?

---
label: 0013
---
Just do the best you can.

---
label: 0020
---
Wait a moment.

---
label: talk1068
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Huh? {{delay8}}You're really going to {{delay8}}help me get
where I need to go on the raft?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Thank you! You're ridiculously kind!{{delay8}}
I'll happily accept your help.

---
label: talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Sure thing! {{delay8}}Raft, here I come!

---
label: talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hoo boy... {{delay8}}I came here with Finley to
look for treasure in this cave.

---
label: talk1012
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}I need to use this raft to catch up to her,
since she swam on ahead.

---
label: talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}But {{color id="0"}}since the water level keeps rising
and falling{{color id="-1"}}, I end up getting stuck on the
rocks, and then the raft capsizes.
I wish I could somehow move the raft
forward bit by bit whenever the water
level is high...

---
label: talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Yes, of course! {{delay8}}I won't give up!

---
label: talk1069
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}No problem! {{delay8}}Thank you so much for
helping me!{{delay8}} Just let me know whenever
you're ready.

---
label: talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}So... {{delay8}}Are you ready to raft?

---
label: talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}Oh... The way it is now, I can't really sit in
the raft. That seems important.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'm pretty sure I'll fall right in the water
unless I'm properly seated. Can you
please leave an open spot for me?

---
label: talk1073
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}Oh... The way it is now, I can't really sit in
the raft. That seems important.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I've been working on my leg strength,
sure, but I only just started getting them
pumped. Can you leave me a spot to sit?

---
label: talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Please let me know when you're ready
to raft!

---
label: talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_00"}}Hm... Something on your mind?

---
label: 0014
---
Where we headed?

---
label: 0015
---
Let's go back for a bit.

---
label: 0021
---
Leave the raft for a sec.

---
label: 0016
---
It's nothing.

---
label: talk1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What? You're heading back?{{delay8}} Oh, hey,
no worries. I understand. {{delay8}}Please be
careful on the way back.

---
label: talk1034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Phew... {{delay8}}So we made it back somehow.

---
label: talk1071
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}You got it.{{delay8}} I'll vacate the raft right away.

---
label: talk1072
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Please just let me know when you're
ready to head out.

---
label: talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sigh...

---
label: talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I have to catch up to Finley! She swam on
ahead all by herself!

---
label: talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_01"}}Poor Finley. She must be so worried.{{delay8}}
I need to catch up to her as soon as
possible!

---
label: talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful"}}Ah... {{delay8}}I see.{{delay15}} Well, please keep up the
great work.

---
label: talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}So, um... Is there anything else you want
to ask?

---
label: talk1035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}We did it!{{delay8}} I'm finally here. Thank you!

---
label: talk1056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sasan! Look at you! You're so pale.
{{delay8}}Are you all right?

---
label: talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}I...I'm fine. Really.{{delay8}} So sorry I kept
you waiting.

---
label: talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Look at that, Sasan...{{delay8}} There's a stone
emitting a mysterious light!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Could this be the sacred shrine that
houses the blessed stone written of in
that ancient manuscript?

---
label: talk1025_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hm. But I don't see any treasure like I was
imagining.{{delay8}} How disappointing.

---
label: talk1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Finley...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}We journeyed to this cave all the way from
Zora's Domain in search of treasure.

It was really tough, but now the two of us
have the memory of seeing this sacred
shrine together.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That means more to me than any treasure
ever could!

---
label: talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Sasan...{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Our little treasure hunt...it was a blast. I'll
never forget it!

You're right. This memory is the greatest
treasure of all. Truly.

---
label: talk1028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you so much for bringing me all the
way out here. {{delay8}}It's because of you that
Finley and I have this treasured memory.
Oh, that reminds me! {{delay8}}I need to reward
you!{{delay8}} Take this. Please, I insist.

---
label: talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I picked this up along the journey to the
cave!{{delay8}} I'd be overjoyed if it helped you out
in some way.

---
label: talk1090
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh, I have something for you too!{{delay8}}
Here, take this.

---
label: talk1095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Just like Sasan, I found this on my way
here.{{delay8}} It matches his!

---
label: talk1052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}What a great day, Finley. {{delay8}}How about we
head back to Zora's Domain? I can't wait
to tell Kodah...
The story from that ancient
manuscript was real!

---
label: talk1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}That sounds delightful!{{delay8}}


However, let's be sure to hold hands as
we swim back so that we don't get
separated again!

---
label: talk1057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Um...that sounds difficult, but if it's what
you want, sure thing.{{delay8}} Let's please just
take it nice and easy on the way back...

---
label: talk1036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, um... {{delay8}}You might be holding on to too
many things right now?{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I really want to give you an {{color id="0"}}opal {{color id="-1"}}as
thanks.{{delay8}} Once you organize your things,
it's all yours.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I want to give you an {{color id="0"}}opal {{color id="-1"}}as thanks.
Let me know when you make some room.

---
label: talk1038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I want to give you an {{color id="0"}}opal {{color id="-1"}}too! You had
better make room for both.

---
label: talk1039

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh, look at that! {{delay8}}You made room for my
gift.{{delay8}} Here, it's all yours, along with my
thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Huh?! What in the world is happening?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Finley isn't over here!{{delay15}} Maybe we

label: talk1045

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Um, what are you doing?{{delay8}} I'd appreciate it
if you didn't do anything weird to the raft.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey!{{delay8}} I need that raft to get to Finley!{{delay8}}
Please, please, please don't break it...
