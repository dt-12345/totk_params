{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Wake up! Oh, please wake up!


{{color id="0"}}Saguru{{color id="-1"}}'s not far off, and if he finds out

What are you going to do if {{color id="0"}}Saguru {{color id="-1"}}finds
out you've been sleeping on the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I know the rain is soothing and all...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}But SERIOUSLY?


If anyone blabs to {{color id="0"}}Saguru {{color id="-1"}}that someone
is sleeping on that {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}}... I don't
know what I'll do. It's beyond value!

Stone slab?

Where's the inn owner?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful_01"}}Ah, yes. Stone slabs are, well, slabs.
Like the one this guy's SLEEPING on.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The survey team discovered stone slabs
in each of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}sites here. They
found this one in the {{color id="0"}}ruin above us{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Our leader is able to read Zonai writing
and says the text on this slab is a record
of a historic fight.
One that was between a great king of
that era...and the Demon King.

The ruler did not, or could not, defeat
the Demon King and instead imprisoned
that mighty foe.
The text also says...{{delay15}}that the sages who
fought beside this ruler {{color id="0"}}left something
behind{{color id="-1"}} in case the Demon King returned.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It worries me to know this discovery talks
about a Demon King's return...{{delay15}}and here
the Upheaval has just happened.
If only we knew what those sages did to
prepare{{color id="0"}} in case he came back{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah,{{delay8}} sorry. I didn't mean to think and fret
at the same time there.

You can read the {{color id="0"}}deciphered writing{{color id="-1"}} for
yourself. It's all right next to the slab.

label: Talk_0009

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Huh, the inn owner is...him! That
guy there!

He came to change our beds, but then I
realized he'd fallen sound asleep.

Nothing wakes him up! I tried shouting.
And then shaking him. Nothing!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What's more, he decided to doze off on
top of this priceless {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}He's been saying "truffle" now and then.


Maybe he's having a dream of eating
a {{color id="0"}}hearty truffle{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder if he'd wake up if he {{color id="0"}}smelled{{color id="-1"}}
one right under his nose.

But it's hard to get a hearty truffle.
They're pretty rare. I did find one,
however...

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It was bobbing along under that waterfall.


I don't know if somebody dropped the
truffle there or if it {{color id="0"}}floated in{{color id="-1"}} from
somewhere else.

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}*sigh*...{{delay15}} At any rate, I hope he'll get off
of the {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} soon.

label: Talk_0010

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}Huh? I said it was this guy!{{delay8}} The one who's
sound asleep on the {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}}!

He won't wake up even if I shake him or
shout. This is really bad!

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}It looks like he's having a dream about
{{color id="0"}}hearty truffles{{color id="-1"}}.

Maybe he'd open his eyes if he {{color id="0"}}smelled{{color id="-1"}}
a truffle in front of his nose.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But hearty truffles are fairly rare and
hard to find.{{delay15}}

I found one...once.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I've got to do something about this guy
soon though. {{color id="0"}}Saguru{{color id="-1"}}'s in the{{color id="0"}} ruins above{{color id="-1"}},
and he'll come back here eventually.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Thanks for helping me wake that guy up!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can't believe he fell asleep on one of the
priceless {{color id="0"}}stone slabs{{color id="-1"}}. That can't have
been comfortable.
Anyway, I'm glad he woke up before
{{color id="0"}}Saguru {{color id="-1"}}found him.

label: Talk_0013

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Looking at this {{color id="0"}}stone slab {{color id="-1"}}makes me think
about that inn owner. Hoo-boy, I sure
was nervous!
I'm glad you came along before {{color id="0"}}Saguru{{color id="-1"}}
found him.

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I still can't believe he fell asleep on a
{{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} of all things...

I'm sure glad he woke up before {{color id="0"}}Saguru{{color id="-1"}}
found him.

---
label: Talk_0018

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Ah, yes. Stone slabs are, well, slabs.
Like the one that inn owner was using
as a bed.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hang on... If I slept on a stone slab, would I dream
about the glory days of the Zonai?

{{color id="0"}}Saguru {{color id="-1"}}never comes down, so maybe I'll give it
a try...{{size value="100"}}
