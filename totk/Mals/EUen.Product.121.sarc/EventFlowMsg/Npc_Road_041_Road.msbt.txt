{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Ack, it's the Yiga Clan! Wait.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Notice"}}That mask... That's one I made!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hey, I know you—you're the guy who
saved me.{{delay8}} You gave me a real jump there!

label: FriendGreet_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm glad to see you keeping well, at least!
You're clearly having fun on your journey.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Me, I'm still spending all my time seeking
out {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}, so that I might
return to my beloved Nobo.

label: FriendGreet_00

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh! {{delay8}}We met earlier, right?{{delay15}} Remember me?{{pageBreak}}Of course you do, nobody could forget
style this sublime.{{delay8}} You saved me from
the Yiga Clan!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Gotta say, {{delay15}}being forced to make their
costumes was really miserable.

Who knows what might've happened to
my fashion sense if you hadn't shown up?

label: FriendGreet_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm hot on the trail of Misko's hidden
treasure. First I get the treasure, then I
confess my feelings to my beloved Nobo!
And when I say {{color id="0"}}treasure{{color id="-1"}}, I mean {{color id="0"}}clothes{{color id="-1"}}!
The bandit Misko hid part of their
legendary wardrobe in a nearby {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Just imagine it! Me, dressed entirely in
Cece, offering Nobo my love with one
hand and Misko's clothes with the other!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Old fashion meets new!{{delay8}} Romance meets
adventure! A moving scene that speaks to
love in our modern era!{{delay15}} That's my plan.

label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe it's {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}} of here. I mean,
there is a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} on the northern bank
of the {{color id="0"}}Floria River{{color id="-1"}}, so...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Yeah, I'm calling it now! Misko's treasure
is absolutely, positively in that cave!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Along with a whooole lot of {{color id="0"}}river water{{color id="-1"}}.
That's gonna be a problem.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I mean, I'm dressed in Cece brand from
head to toe.{{delay8}} I'm not about to get any of
this stuff wet.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I know Misko's treasure is hidden near
{{color id="0"}}Floria River {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}. It's in a
cave on the river's north bank!{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But just knowing that doesn't actually
help me. The {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}is filled with {{color id="0"}}river
water{{color id="-1"}}, and I can't get in.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those legendary clothes are supposed
to be in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} somewhere along the
{{color id="0"}}coastline{{color id="-1"}} here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Problem is, there's a lot of coastline,
and no way to narrow things down!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I've heard that if you walk with your eyes
up, you'll find it right away...

But it's supposed to be in a cave, I think.
Caves are usually close to the ground,
right?{{delay8}} Where is this treasure?!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The cave containing Misko's treasure is
supposed to be {{color id="0"}}somewhere along this
very, very long coastline{{color id="-1"}}.
I was told to keep my eyes up, but looking
up for a cave just feels wrong.{{delay8}} Misko
really hid that "hidden treasure," huh?

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Some of Misko's {{color id="0"}}legendary clothing{{color id="-1"}}
should be in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} in this region...{{pageBreak}}I just can't find it.

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} should be in a cave
somewhere around here...{{delay8}}but I've been
looking for so long, I'm just spent.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I won't give up though! I can't confess
my love to Nobo without those clothes!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I see it all in my mind's eye—Nobo, as beautiful as
ever. Me, clad in legendary fashion! Aaah! There's
no way she wouldn't fall in love with me too!
There is, of course, the worry that Nobo might
attract other suitors while I'm out searching...{{pageBreak}}Once I've rested up, I need to find those clothes.{{size value="100"}}

label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've tracked a piece of Misko's {{color id="0"}}legendary
wardrobe{{color id="-1"}} to a {{color id="0"}}cave on the north bank{{color id="-1"}} of
the nearby Floria River!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Which would be great...{{delay8}}if the river hadn't
{{color id="0"}}flooded the cave{{color id="-1"}} and I weren't wearing
designer clothes. What do I do now?

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}treasure's supposed to be in a cave{{color id="-1"}}
on the north bank of the Floria River...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}But the cave's flooded, so I can't get in.

label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You know how you can follow this road
to the sea?{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}One of Misko's treasures{{color id="-1"}} is
hidden in {{color id="0"}}a cave along the shore{{color id="-1"}}.
Sounds like a pretty great tip, right? It is,
until you remember how big the sea is...
That's a lot of ground to cover.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Apparently the key to finding it is to
"walk with your eyes up"...{{delay8}}but it just
feels weird to look up for a cave.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I got a hot tip that the treasure is hidden
in a cave along the coastline.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Yep. Somewhere along this...very, very
long coastline.{{pageBreak}}I have heard it's easier to find the cave
if you "walk with your eyes up."{{pageBreak}}Though honestly, that doesn't make much
sense to me...

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The legendary clothes are in a cave on
the {{color id="0"}}northern bank of the Floria River{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}But the cave is {{color id="0"}}flooded{{color id="-1"}} and getting in
would ruin my outfit... {{delay15}}I'm sorry, Nobo,
but our love will have to wait.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The treasure's supposed to be in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}
on the {{color id="0"}}northern bank of the Floria River{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}
but the cave's completely flooded.
*sigh*{{delay8}} The sooner I get my hands on
{{color id="0"}}Misko's legendary clothes{{color id="-1"}}, the sooner
I can return to my lovely Nobo...

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I know it's hidden inside a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere {{color id="0"}}along the shore{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}But there's a whole lot of shore and only
one me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I heard that you need to "walk with your
eyes up," but I'm not about to risk my
Cece-designed hat falling off.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm not even close to finding {{color id="0"}}Misko's
legendary clothes{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}They're supposed to
be in a {{color id="0"}}cave by the seashore{{color id="-1"}}...
But so far, no dice. I've heard you've got
to "walk with your eyes up," but I don't
want my Cece hat to fall off.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Also, seeing it again...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I make a fine mask! Any Yiga would be
lucky to end up with gear that elegant.{{delay15}}
I really am a fashion genius.

label: Yiga_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Also, it might not be my place to say...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}But maybe find a different look. {{delay15}}Otherwise
everyone will think you're part of the
Yiga Clan.
