{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello, welcome!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm sorry. The old fellas who stock this
place are busy driving off monsters.

They've gone off to the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}}
that's among {{color id="0"}}the hills that lead west{{color id="-1"}}
of the village.
So, as you can see, we've run out
of goods.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those two... They just don't get along.
That's going to stand in the way of them
taking care of that problem up there!
I can't go and check up on them, and the
longer they're away, the more worried
I get.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I'm sorry. I'm afraid we've got nothing
in stock.

The old fellas who stock this place haven't
come back from chasing off monsters.

They're up at the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}that's among
{{color id="0"}}the hills that lead west{{color id="-1"}} of the village.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I'm sorry. I'm afraid we're almost
completely sold out.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? You defeated the monsters? And
those two have made up?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can't believe it! But if it's true, then
this is quite the occasion!

Those two have been bickering for ages.
Offense is best. Defense is best. Pffft!
Round and round until my head hurts.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Please take this, along with my thanks
for doing the impossible.

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Thank you, truly!


After the old fellas get back, I'm sure
that they'll get this place stocked again.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So please come back!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I usually recommend the {{color id="0"}}swift carrots{{color id="-1"}}
that my mister grows, but here's
the problem...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}He's gone off with that other old fella
to {{color id="0"}}drive out {{color id="-1"}}monsters that live in one of
the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
It's the ruin that's among {{color id="0"}}the hills that
lead west {{color id="-1"}}of the village.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}So, he's not here to tend to his garden,
and that's why we're pretty much out
of stock.

{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Fortify your defense!

---
label: Near03
---
{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Offense is best!

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You blather on about that "best defense
is a good offense" nonsense...

And now it's morning already!

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}On and on you go with your "best defense
is a good offense" nonsense...

And now it's afternoon already!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You just don't know when to stop going
on and on with that "best defense is a
good offense" nonsense.
And now, here we are. The sun's
gone down!

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I don't care how many times you say it,
"the best defense is a good offense" is
still nonsense from back to front...
And now look at us. It's late at night!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}We haven't gotten any closer to gettin'
rid of those monsters!

And we won't as long as you keep turning
it upside down. The best offense is NOT
a good defense!

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You stubborn old codger!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Yeah? Look who's talkin'!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}While you've been going on and on with
your poppycock about offense being
superior to defense...
We're stuck here until you see reason!
We need to clear out those monsters!

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}What?! Don't blame me. We can't get to
those monsters because you keep spittin'
all your foolish talk!
There's no way that defense is better
than offense!

You know what? I'm done! You can just
go off and "defend" yourself all you want.
I'm not going to be worm food.

I don't believe it!

What...

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You defeated all the monsters...
Just who are you...

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A member of the Yiga Clan...{{delay8}} Or not, it
seems! Just who are you?

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Th-that was some kind of fightin' he
did there, Olkin...

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It sure was. {{delay8}}A firm grasp of defense AND
a strong hand with offense!

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Have I had it wrong all these years? It's
plain as day now. You can't defeat your
enemies purely with defense!

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}No, I had it wrong. If you just attack,
you're goin' to get hurt. Or worse.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Well, the important thing is that we've
realized the truth before it's too late.
We need a balance between the two.
And this fine fighter here...showed us
the way.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I don't know if this is a good reward,
but Olkin knows a thing or two about
defense. I'm all about offense.
I doubt there's much a warrior like you
could learn from the likes of us, but glad
to help if we can.

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well, now that the monsters are gone, I'd
suggest that we head back to our village.

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Right. I bet my Trissa's store is runnin'
low on goods right about now. People
there must be in deep need.

---
label: Talk40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Well, visitor, I heard the news.{{delay8}} You've
done us a huge favor.

Those two have argued about offense
and defense since they were barely old
enough to walk!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}They just praised each other's vegetables,
and now it's like a brand-new day for
those old coots.
We've also got some stock back in, so
it's happy days all around.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That reminds me, please take this...

---
label: Talk55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}That's called an {{color id="0"}}endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}. Cook it
to gain stamina. It's a precious natural
remedy.
It's been prized since old times, and it's
become remarkably rare of late. Please,
take it with you on your journey.

---
label: Talk51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh dear.{{delay8}} Looks like your pouch is full.


I thought I'd give you this {{color id="0"}}endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}
in thanks.{{delay8}} But please come back when
you've made some space.

---
label: Talk77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh dear, oh dear...{{delay8}} Your pouch is still full.


I want to give you this {{color id="0"}}endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}
in thanks. But please come back when
you've made some space.

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thank you, truly! {{delay8}}Please drop by anytime!

---
label: Talk59

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Made some space in your pouch?{{delay8}} Then
here's what I couldn't give you...
