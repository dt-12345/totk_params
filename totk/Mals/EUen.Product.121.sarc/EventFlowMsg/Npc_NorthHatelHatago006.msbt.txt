{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not only is it your first visit to {{color id="0"}}Wetland{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Say, Link,{{delay8}} have you heard about the
trouble in {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}All that good water polluted by {{color id="0"}}some kind
of mysterious muck{{color id="-1"}}. As far as I know,
no one knows where it came from.
It's terrible for the Zora, of course,
being water folk. I'm not sure how
they'll manage.
{{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}} is to the east past the
{{color id="0"}}Lanayru Wetlands{{color id="-1"}}. I used to recommend
it to tourists, but...well...

label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Link, have you already decided where
you'll head next? Perhaps the beautiful
city of water, Zora's Domain?{{pageBreak}}I also recommend {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. It's
a popular spot due to its unusual ruins.
Have you seen them?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They're hard to miss. As you exit the
stable, head to your right, toward the
{{color id="0"}}big ring{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}Link! Did those drawings catch your

They're actually images of...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Link! Are you interested in those pictures
after all?{{pageBreak}}It's not like the footprints of that
{{color id="0"}}rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}are something you
see every day, eh?

Rumored beast?

---
label: Talk1005

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}That's right! Just a little while ago, a
customer who came from the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} drew
them for me.
It seems that there were {{color id="0"}}twin kids {{color id="-1"}}at a
stable somewhere who said they'd seen it.{{pageBreak}}The customer heard all about the beast
and the footprints from those kids.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Now, I don't tend to believe all of the wild
tales that kids tell, but...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's been a lot of chatter around the
{{color id="0"}}Stable Association {{color id="-1"}}about this {{color id="0"}}rumored
beast{{color id="-1"}}, so I thought it might be true.

Goodbye.

label: Talk1007

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Sorry... I got a little carried away.{{pageBreak}}It's just that the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}} is a hot
topic around the {{color id="0"}}Stable Association {{color id="-1"}}right
now, and, you know...{{delay15}} It's so exciting...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}Huh? At Lakeside Stable?!{{pageBreak}}...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}I see... So the rumors about the so-called
beast weren't very true, then.{{pageBreak}}I must admit, it was thrilling to think that
there was a mysterious beast out there,
ready to spring into the open.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}But thank you for letting me know. As
disappointing as it is, it's better to know
the truth.
Stables should be providing accurate
information for travelers and customers,
so it's important to know the real story!
Thank you for this valuable information.
Since you helped the stable out, here...

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That's a good reward, right? I hope you
visit us again soon!

label: Talk1014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Link, are you still interested in the
Dondon footprints?{{pageBreak}}To think that the rumors about a beast
were actually about animals Princess
Zelda cared for at Lakeside Stable...
All sorts of customers had been coming
to ask if those rumors were true.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Thanks to your information, Link, we can
give them the real story. You really helped
us out!
Providing information is an essential
stable duty. The truth is always more
important than fanciful ideas.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hm? A customer?{{delay8}} Please, allow me to

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Hey, Link! Replacing our furnishings is
such a bother!{{pageBreak}}That decoration is a popular lucky charm
right now, so we made sure to get one
for our stable.{{pageBreak}}If you want your own, they sell them
in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, which is in the
mountains to the southeast.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Now, now, Link!{{delay8}} Please don't make me
tell you again!{{pageBreak}}If you want one of these decorations,
you should go buy one for yourself.{{pageBreak}}They sell them in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, which
you can find in the mountains southeast
of here.

label: BurnedWakka_01

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}If you're SO interested in that decoration,
how about you go buy your own?

They're sold in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, which is

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Since I'm going to the trouble of hanging
a painting, I'd sure like to hang one of the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}everyone's talking about.
The Ring Ruins are ruins that are each
shaped like rings. They all fell around
Kakariko Village in the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}My gosh, are they ever a hot topic with
all the customers who come here!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So I'd like to have a{{color id="0"}} BIG painting {{color id="-1"}}of them
to hang on the wall. One that shows that
{{color id="0"}}ring-like shape {{color id="-1"}}they have.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But I can't paint that scene without seeing
it. Sure, I can see some of the ruins from
here, but it's all too far away to see well.
Anyway, I'd really like to do up that
painting, but I'm just not sure how to
go about it.

label: Com_Photo_02

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Wait, do you have a picture of the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?

label: Com_Photo_03

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Since I'm going to be hanging a painting
up, I'd like to hang one that shows the
Ring Ruins around Kakariko Village.
Everyone's talking about them these days!


I'd really like to display it in a big way,
so the{{color id="0"}} picture{{color id="-1"}} needs to show off their
unusual {{color id="0"}}ring-like shape{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Com_Photo_09

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'd like to paint a picture of the Ring Ruins
everyone's talking about. But they're so

What I need is a {{color id="0"}}big, impressive picture{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Did you bring me a picture of the

label: Com_Photo_05

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}You can see them from this stable, but
they're still too far away for me to paint
them properly.{{delay8}} I'm not sure what to do.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}},

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Whoa!{{delay8}} I'm really happy with this nice, big
painting of the Ring Ruins here.

But if you have a different {{color id="0"}}picture of the
Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, I'm happy to copy it and hang
it there instead.
Yes, if you ever want to see some fresh
art up there, just show me a new image!

---
label: Com_Photo_08

They really are huge ruins, aren't they...{{delay8}}
Who built those? And why? What was
their purpose?
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}No wonder that ruins falling out of
the sky has caused such a stir all
around Hyrule.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thanks to you, Link, I got that painting
