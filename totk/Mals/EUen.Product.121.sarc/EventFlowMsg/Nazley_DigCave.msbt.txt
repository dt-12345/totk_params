That's it for the entrance...

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}A cave-in? You've got to be kidding me.
How am I supposed to get inside now?

---
label: 0001
---
What's wrong?

---
label: 0002
---
Where's Tulin?

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, {{delay8}}take a gander for yourself.

---
label: Talk02_01
---
The entrance to the cave is completely
blocked off.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I was hauling food out of there when the
entrance collapsed. Now what do I do?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I should have picked some bomb flowers
from the other caves. Could've used 'em
to blow these rocks away. What foul luck.
I hate to leave all that food behind, but
maybe I just need to call today a wash
and come back tomorrow.

label: Talk09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Tulin? Do you need him for something?


He's out collecting food at another cave
right now. I'm pretty sure he was with
Gesane's group.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}bonfire{{color id="-1"}} burning outside the
{{color id="0"}}entrance {{color id="-1"}}of the cave he was headed to,
so that should help you find him.
It'll be a good place to warm up and rest
if you feel yourself starting to freeze too.

label: Near02
---
There's no other way in...

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This isn't good. The cave entrance is
completely blocked off!

Ugh, why didn't I harvest bomb flowers
from the other caves? I could've used
them to blow these rocks away.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's still food in that cave I haven't
hauled out... I have to get in there
somehow.

---
label: 0003
---
See you around.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Maybe I could manage if I had something
to break the rocks with, but as it is, my
wings are clipped.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}I hate to ask, but...could you clear the
way into the cave?

---
label: 0009
---
Leave it to me.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Really?! I'd appreciate that.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It'd be great if you could make a hole {{color id="0"}}big
enough {{color id="-1"}}for me to walk through.

That will let me bring the supply of food
in the cave back to the village.

---
label: 0010
---
I wasn't planning on it...

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Ah. {{delay8}}I suppose that's fair.


It doesn't seem like there's any way in
except through these rocks. And I did not
come here prepared to dig.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Hmmm. {{delay8}}Maybe I just need to call it a day
and come back tomorrow.

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hey, could—{{delay8}} Could you get through those
rocks for me?

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Listen, I—{{delay8}} Would you break through the
rocks blocking the cave for me?

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hey...{{delay8}} Would you be willing to open up the
blocked cave for me?

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Really?! I'd appreciate that. We were
trying to collect what food we could
from this cave.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}As you can see, a cave-in closed off
the entrance, and I can't get in.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But if you make a {{color id="0"}}hole in the rocks big
enough for me to walk through{{color id="-1"}}, I can
bring that food back to the village.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I see. {{delay8}}That's too bad.


There's food in that cave, but I can't bring
it back to the village if I can't get in.

Seems my only option is to dig through
those rocks. Even getting prepped for
that could take a while though...
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}Maybe I should just cut my losses
and give up on this for today.

---
label: Near03
---
Whoa! Look at the cave!

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Again, sorry to trouble you with this.


If you could make a {{color id="0"}}hole big enough for
me to walk through{{color id="-1"}}, it'd be a huge help.

---
label: 0007

Hang tight.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks. I owe you one.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Hey! {{delay8}}Those rocks didn't know what hit
them. You're amazing!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Now I can bring some supplies back to
the village! Thank you so much!

Oh, right, I need to reward you somehow,
don't I? {{delay8}}Here, take this.

Consider it a token of my gratitude!{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}All right, I'm going to go check if that
food is still good. Thank you for opening
a path for me!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Hey! {{delay8}}I saw what you did. That was
awesome! Those rocks never stood
a chance.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I was searching the cave for food to bring
back to the village, but a cave-in blocked
off the entrance and put a stop to that.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But now, thanks to you, I can fly the
supplies in there back home.

I know you didn't do it for me, but...
Here's a token of my gratitude. {{delay8}}Take it.{{delay15}}
