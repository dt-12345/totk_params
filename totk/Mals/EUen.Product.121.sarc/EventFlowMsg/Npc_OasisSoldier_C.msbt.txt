{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I did everything I could to fight against
the Gibdos with my spear, but I hardly left
a scratch!
They're incredibly hardy, and their
numbers...{{delay8}} If we don't pick them off
fast, they'll surround and wipe us out!
But if we want to win...

label: Talk16

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can't believe that my expertly delivered
spear attacks did nothing to even slow
them down.
I guess there's only one option available
to me!{{delay15}}

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I've got to hone my spear skills!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I attached an {{color id="0"}}Electric Lizalfos horn{{color id="-1"}} to my
spear like another guard suggested, but...

I don't know. This seems like such a
simple solution. Is it really going to be
the key to defeating the Gibdos?
Well, we can't know for sure until we try.
Nothing we've done so far has been the
answer, anyway.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hrnnnnnn!{{delay15}} I can feel the energy!{{delay15}} Can you
feel it too?

It's Lady Riju's power!{{delay15}} I feel invincible!{{delay15}}
I cannot lose!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You showed off some really impressive
abilities with your bow during the battle.

I can't imagine how much training you've
endured to become so skilled.

Really, this whole event has revealed how
much more I could do to improve myself!

---
label: Talk15

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Until now, I always thought that you
could get through a fight with skill and
strength alone...
But it seems like my way of thinking is a
bit out of date. Some folks are fighting
with {{color id="0"}}modified weapons{{color id="-1"}}...
I never realized what else could turn the
tide of a battle.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That said! {{delay15}}Weapons aren't everything. A
well-equipped army of greenhorns can still
fall to experienced opponents!
Training is just as important as ever!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you need something from me? As you
can see, I'm busy training right now.

Once I've trained just a bit more...

label: Talk25

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Then I'm planning to go defeat a Molduga.
You know, the monster of the desert!

Training is good, but actual experience in
battle is even more important!

---
label: 0001
---
Molduga?

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There are many different kinds of
monsters that roam the Gerudo Desert.

There is one, though, that is gigantic!
It's a fierce creature known as a {{color id="0"}}Molduga{{color id="-1"}}.

Even for us Gerudo, a Molduga is a
dangerous opponent. We usually attack in
numbers, yet the battle is always tough.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But once I've finished my training, beating
one will be as easy as taking honey candy
from a vehvi!
First, I'll draw the attention of a Molduga
with something that makes sound. They
have famously {{color id="0"}}sensitive hearing{{color id="-1"}}, after all.
And then, once it comes to the surface,
I'll launch a full-on attack! What do you
think? Perfect plan, am I right?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I just...{{delay8}}need to do a bit more training
