{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello. You're out early.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're having pleasant weather today.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, what did you need at this time of
the day?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, what did you need, out in this rain?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Why are you wearing that awful mask?


It'd be a good idea to remove that while
in this village. If you mean it as some sort
of joke, some will not find it funny.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}You're the lad who helped us defeat
those monsters! I have to thank you for
bringing a geezer like me to my senses.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I talked everything out with Steen, and I
understand now that he's just a bold sort.
Charges ahead. Makes his own way.
We spend our hours discussing the
merits of pumpkins—and of carrots, of
course.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}By the way, during our talks, Steen and I
came up with {{color id="0"}}a method of attacking
while defending{{color id="-1"}}.
A lad like you has probably mastered
all there's to know about battle.

But I'd be glad to share our method
with you if you're interested.

---
label: 0005

I'm interested!

No, thanks. Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Normally, you'd use a shield only for
defense, right? And you can't use it to
attack.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Or CAN you? You see, if you {{color id="0"}}attach a
weapon to a shield{{color id="-1"}}, you can then defend
and attack at the same time.
Steen and I think it'd be worth trying
out with {{color id="0"}}monster horns {{color id="-1"}}and{{color id="0"}} rocks{{color id="-1"}}. Good
thing we got to talking.
We believe that, if you really run with
this idea, it opens up a whole bunch of
interesting possibilities.

---
label: talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration"}}Keeping an open mind can lead to
attaching new ideas to your old ones, and
that's more impressive in the end.
So, attacking while defending—who knew
that was possible. Yet it is, if you {{color id="0"}}attach
a weapon to your shield{{color id="-1"}}.
Steen and I are still working on this
method and hope to test it out with
{{color id="0"}}monster horns {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}rocks{{color id="-1"}}.
Who'd have thought that two opinionated
old geezers like us could put aside our
differences to talk about battle.

---
label: talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Ha! All this talk is probably just a lot of
blather to a skilled fighter like you.

---
label: talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}You shouldn't wear that awful mask in
this village. Not many of us would find
it funny in the least.

---
label: talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Trissa sells my pumpkins now at her {{color id="0"}}store{{color id="-1"}},
and that makes me want to work extra
hard in my field.
Steen is helping me too. I appreciate
all of the support.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}And I know that I would have never come
up with that {{color id="0"}}method of attacking while
defending {{color id="-1"}}without him.
A lad like you has surely mastered all
there's to know about battle.

But I'd be glad to share that new method
of ours if you're interested.

---
label: talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm glad to work hard with Steen so
that Trissa has an easier time stocking
up her {{color id="0"}}store{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's the usual time I help Steen with
his field.

---
label: talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I got a lot done in my field too, thanks
to Steen's help.

---
label: talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I'm sure if he wasn't around, I wouldn't
have figured out that new {{color id="0"}}method of
attacking while defending{{color id="-1"}}.
I can't believe I didn't get along with him
until now. What a shame.

A lad like you has likely mastered all
there's to know about battle.

But I'd be glad to show you the {{color id="0"}}secret
technique {{color id="-1"}}I came up with, if you're
interested.

---
label: talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That idea that Steen and I came up
with, that whole {{color id="0"}}method of attacking

It's probably not interesting to a lad like
you, who's mastered all there is to know
about battle.
But I'd be glad to show you the {{color id="0"}}secret
technique {{color id="-1"}}I came up with, if you're
curious.

label: talk25

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you want a fortified pumpkin, buy it
at Trissa's store. Steen sold her on the
idea of selling my pumpkins there.

---
label: talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I don't sell my fortified pumpkins here.
Buy them at Trissa's store.

---

Goodbye.

---
label: talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}The fortified pumpkin has the effect
of {{color id="0"}}making you tougher{{color id="-1"}}.

If you use them in your cooking, the
dishes will increase your defense.

I used to ask my old lady to cook up
those dishes so I could eat some of
that every day.

---
label: talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Trissa has more than pumpkins in her
store. Stock up on ingredients there
anytime you head out of our village.

That's an impressive pumpkin. You might
be reprimanded if you take it.
