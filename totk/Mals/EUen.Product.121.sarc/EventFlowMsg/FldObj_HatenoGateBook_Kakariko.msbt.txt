While Tauro and I were taking a break, he
asked me, "Hey, Calip, what attracted you
to join the Zonai Survey Team?"{{pageBreak}}A little flustered, I answered that I heard
its research division was led by a brilliant
man by the name of Tauro.{{pageBreak}}Because of you, essentially.{{pageBreak}}I meant it sincerely, and in my heart,
I longed to continue...{{pageBreak}}"You're not like these other dullards, you
know. You immediately grasp the breadth
of my vision."{{pageBreak}}Of course, no such thing passed my lips.{{pageBreak}}But I am certain that Tauro, and no one
else, is the man who can help the world
see my indescribable worth.

Our leader Tauro has done nothing
but surprise me since I joined the
Zonai Survey Team.{{pageBreak}}One day, I arrived at the research site to
find him sitting on bare earth as he stared
at a stone slab.{{pageBreak}}I wished him a good morning, and to that
he turned to me and said...{{pageBreak}}"Ah, Calip. Sorry I didn't notice you.
Working overtime today, huh?"{{pageBreak}}I thought back to the night before. As I
was heading in, I saw Tauro sitting on
bare earth, examining a stone slab.{{pageBreak}}It hit me then—he had stayed up all
through the night puzzling over the
slab, never moving from his perch.{{pageBreak}}I felt a profound envy of his ability to
focus so completely that the passing of
time escaped his notice.

It's a researcher's duty to use his wisdom
and intuition to bring to light historical
truths which the ruins would keep secret.{{pageBreak}}We carry on the work of our forebears and
continue our pursuit tirelessly, then pass
what we learn to those who come after.{{pageBreak}}Our leader Tauro understands well that
this is not a task that can be completed
in a single generation.{{pageBreak}}He says this is why he wants to make so
many discoveries, even if the credit to
whom they belong is lost.{{pageBreak}}That's the sort of man Tauro is. But I,
Dr. Calip, won't be so easily satisfied.{{pageBreak}}My discoveries will be noteworthy, to be
sure, but it is my name that I want to live
on forever.{{pageBreak}}Not just in peoples' memories, but in
books, stone tablets, and—if I might be
a trifle immodest—landmarks!{{pageBreak}}Calip Valley, Calip River, the Calip Hills...
My dreams recognize no boundaries!
                                                -Dr. Calip
