{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, you're the one, uh...{{delay15}}from the survey
team's whole misunderstanding about
that underpants thing.
I guess meeting you in a place like this
shows you're traveling all over too.

---
label: Hello_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You know, I can't help thinking...


What would have happened to all those
people on the survey team if I'd never
traveled to Foothill Stable?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Some of them would've gotten hurt if
they'd kept trying to do survey work in
their underpants.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'm just glad I could help everyone figure
out it was all a mistake. Our day-to-day
work is way too important.

---
label: Hello_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}And, er,{{delay8}} given that we cleared up that
misunderstanding, you sure you want to
be out here in the field like that?
I mean, you might be safe if you stick
around here, but it'd be dangerous to
head out into this snowy terrain that way.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I was just offering up a prayer at
this memorial.{{delay15}}

The only reason Hyrule still exists is that
there were those who fought for it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I know the kingdom has been a strange
and dangerous place since the Upheaval.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But as we face the problems of today,
at least we can look to the people of the
past for inspiration.
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}They worked hard to have peace in their
time, and I'm going to do the same!

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}By offering up my prayers, I am thanking
the spirits of those who kept Hyrule safe.

I'm also asking for them to protect and
guide me as I do my research.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I may not be able to fight for my kingdom,
but I can defend it through my research!

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmph... I can't find a path that leads
down to the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}How did it end up down there, anyway?


Maybe they built it at ground level, but
after a seismic shift, it got swallowed up
into the earth.
Or could it be {{delay8}}they put it in down there
on purpose to {{color id="0"}}hide something important{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}
Hmmm.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Beneath us, there's an extraordinary ruin
called the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.

I just wish I knew how to get to it.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You really have to wonder why the
ancients put it down there!

Hiding some kind of {{color id="0"}}priceless treasure{{color id="-1"}},
perhaps? You never know!

{{anim type="LaughS"}}I say that as someone who considers
murals and dusty old monuments to be
priceless treasures.
I've learned that not everyone shares
that viewpoint.

label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In a sense, we can be grateful it's raining
here. At least it's not cold enough for it
to snow.
That's why I've always been nervous
about visiting {{color id="0"}}Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}} in
{{color id="0"}}Tabantha Tundra{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}As nice as it sounds, I really cannot stand
the cold.{{delay8}}

I've been told it's fine as long as you have
{{color id="0"}}food or clothing{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}keep you warm{{color id="-1"}}.

{{anim type="Ease_01"}}But I'm not sure... Even just seeing snow
in the distance, I start to shiver.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd love to stretch my legs and go on
a stroll to {{color id="0"}}Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}} in {{color id="0"}}Tabantha
Tundra{{color id="-1"}}, really I would.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I just am not cut out for the cold.{{delay8}}


I've been told it's fine as long as you have

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That canyon alongside the road is called
Tanagar Canyon.

And at one end of it, there's a ruin known
as the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.

I'm thinking about heading down there
to investigate.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But the canyon...{{delay15}}it's so deep. How am
I going to get down?

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What?! You want to investigate the
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}} with me?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wish I could take you up on that. But it's
at the bottom of Tanagar Canyon.

And I just haven't been able to find a path
down there.

But maybe if you look for one, you'll have
better luck.

---
label: GoRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I really want to get to the bottom of
Tanagar Canyon, that canyon along
the road.
There's an amazing ruin at the bottom
called the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I just...{{delay8}} Urgh... {{delay8}}I can't find a path
down there.

I've walked up and down this road so
many times, and nothing. {{delay8}}Nothing!

I thank you...

How do I get down there?

Phew! Time for a breather.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I've been rescued.{{delay8}} Thanks. Don't know
how I would've made it on my own.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks!{{delay8}} You really saved me! There's no
way I could've survived that myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Ah! You saved me!{{delay8}} I can't believe it.
Thank you so, so much!

Thank you.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ohhh...{{delay8}} That really, really hurt.{{delay8}} I'll still
be aching tomorrow.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh, th-that...{{delay8}}that was the worst...{{delay8}} But I
made it through somehow.

like that before.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I have to give you something in thanks

Please, take this. I think it will be helpful
on your journey.
