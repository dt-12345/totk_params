Wait. Let me start over. Because of his wife's

Hudson recruited her when he built this village. So...{{delay15}}

She's got quite a backbone. Doesn't let her mama

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I heard from my husband, Hagie—and this is just
between you and me, mind you—a little something
about Mattison.
He said she's tried to board the {{color id="0"}}railcar {{color id="-1"}}multiple
times to visit her papa at the construction site.
And she got in trouble for it!
Apparently she couldn't pay the {{color id="0"}}fee{{color id="-1"}}. She really
should just talk to her papa and mama about it.

But it's hard for children to tell their parents when
