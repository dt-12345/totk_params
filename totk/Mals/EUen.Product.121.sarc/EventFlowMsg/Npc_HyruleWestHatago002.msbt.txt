{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm tired of waiting around for my older
brothers to make a decision.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Maybe I'll simply...leave. Go off and have
an adventure of my own.{{delay8}} They'd probably
come running after me though!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Do you need something? If so, you'd be
better off asking a {{color id="0"}}stable worker {{color id="-1"}}for help.
I'm just a visitor.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}My older brothers have been arguing
incessantly about where to go next.
It's exhausting.
I got so tired of listening to them that
I had to seek refuge out here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I don't put much faith in either legends or

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Hold on! Can this wait until later?


Long ago, my metal sword was struck by
lightning and, well... Let's just say I get

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I would like to lie down in my bed, but my

prefer to be sleeping inside.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But of course, I can't because my older
brothers... {{delay15}}They'll keep on bickering, even
while they're asleep!
Good grief. {{color id="0"}}Rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}legendary
