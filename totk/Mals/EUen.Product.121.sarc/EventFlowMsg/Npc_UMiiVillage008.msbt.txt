{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now, what did I have for dinner again?
Or...perhaps I haven't had dinner yet?

label: Talk_0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Whew, it's sure hard to stay up
late nowadays.

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ooh, I feel rainy days right in the knees.

---
label: Near_0001
---
Ooh, what a chill!

---
label: Talk_0095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Need to take shelter... This cold is no
good for these old bones!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh! Well, well. It's been a while.

---
label: Talk_0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My memory isn't what it used to be, but of
course I remember you.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Yes, we met just over there. Or, ah,
maybe it was over there...

---
label: Talk_0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Eh? {{delay8}}Who are you, again? I'm sure I
recognize you from somewhere.

I just can't keep things straight,
these days...

---
label: Talk_0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well, that's nothing for you to worry
about. It certainly doesn't worry me!

---
label: Talk_0042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I just remembered that I'm supposed to
meet my wife.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Eh?{{delay8}} Oh, this won't do...


I need to hurry if I'm going to be on time.

---
label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}Now, where is my sweetheart? I thought
this is where we agreed to meet...

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It may be late, but I'm wide-awake.


I decided to take a little stroll until it's
time to meet my wife.

Now then... {{delay8}}Where did we decide to
meet? That's important...

Was it here?

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}Was this where we planned to meet?
I'm sure it was outside...

My house...

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What's this? {{delay8}}Where did my house go?{{delay8}}
Did it run off somewhere?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Eh? {{delay8}}Ah, that's right!{{delay8}}


K... {{delay8}}Ki... {{delay8}}Kil...{{delay8}} Kil-something-or-other
bought the house.

What is he planning on doing here,
I wonder?

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, yes, Kil-something-or-other bought
this place.

By the way, dear, would you remind me
where we decided to meet?

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Eh? {{delay8}}Oh, this won't do!{{delay8}}


K... {{delay8}}Ki... {{delay8}}Kil...{{delay8}} Kil-what's-his-name bought
this place.

But what IS this? Is this really
Tarrey Town?

label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}What in Hyrule is this place? Is this really
Tarrey Town? {{delay15}}Is it, dear?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}Eh? What's this?! {{delay8}}My house is gone,{{delay8}}
and instead there's...this?

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}A monster! Look out! A monster!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}Is anyone else here? Am I alone?!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Eh?{{delay8}} Oh, this won't do.{{delay8}} This is a mere
imitation. Hmph.

label: Talk_0006

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Eh? {{delay8}}Oh, this won't do!{{delay8}}


K... {{delay8}}Ki... {{delay8}}Kil...{{delay8}} Kil-what's-his-name bought
this place.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Now that I think about it, wasn't there a
monster here? Maybe someone drove
it away.

label: Talk_0053

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}It's late, isn't it? I should try and sleep.{{delay15}}

But it's late and I'm going to sleep.
Could you come again tomorrow?

---
label: Talk_1002

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Eh? {{delay15}}Who are you?{{delay8}} Are you lost?


I've also been getting more forgetful
lately, so I understand.
