{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Huh?! Who are you?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This is a {{color id="0"}}Hudson Construction {{color id="-1"}}site. We're
doing {{color id="0"}}critical work {{color id="-1"}}that can't be done
anywhere else. It's no place for civilians...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Not to mention the falling ruins. Those are
incredibly dangerous—you really shouldn't
be here.

Hudson Construction?

---
label: Talk_0015

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Hudson Construction is the number one
construction company!

And they don't only do buildings, like the
ones at {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}...

They also build machinery, like the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Towers{{color id="-1"}}. Amazing!

And just wait until you hear about their
latest invention...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}This {{color id="0"}}balloon{{color id="-1"}}!


Can you believe it was made using
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Purah has taken a keen interest in all the
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices {{color id="-1"}}found here.{{pageBreak}}So she asked Hudson to make this balloon
for the Zonai Survey Team to use.{{pageBreak}}Thanks to this thing, the scope of our
research has broadened considerably!

label: Talk_0018

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ahem. Anyway. As I was saying, we do
{{color id="0"}}critical work{{color id="-1"}} here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}No civilians allowed.

Critical work?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}More {{color id="0"}}Zonai artifacts{{color id="-1"}} fall here than

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Look! See that? Only {{color id="0"}}three{{color id="-1"}} have been

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}To someone on the Zonai Survey Team,
a site like this is a dream come true.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Imagine rare research materials just
falling into your lap. Incredible!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We do {{color id="0"}}critical work{{color id="-1"}} here that can't be

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Do you have the capacity to build another
order of balloons? And would you be open
to accommodating a few design requests?

label: Talk_0023

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Of course. We'll do whatever we can to
help with your research.
