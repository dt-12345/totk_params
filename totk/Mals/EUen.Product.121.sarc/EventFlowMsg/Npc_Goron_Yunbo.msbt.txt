{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I remembered something about that
other {{color id="0"}}Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.

When we were mining marbled rock roast
{{color id="0"}}on the north side of Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}},
she said something kinda funny.
She told me not to go near the {{color id="0"}}Lizard
Lakes{{color id="-1"}}. But she didn't say why.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hey, Link...


I've been crackin' my skull trying to
remember anything that might help clue
us in on Princess Zelda.
But so much of my memory is a blur from
when I was wearing that weird mask...
I did recall one thing though.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}When we were mining marbled rock roast
{{color id="0"}}on the north side of Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}, the
princess said something.
She told me not to go near the {{color id="0"}}Lizard
Lakes{{color id="-1"}}. But she didn't say why.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's why I was talking to Boss about it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder why that other {{color id="0"}}Zelda {{color id="-1"}}told me not
to go near the {{color id="0"}}Lizard Lakes{{color id="-1"}}.

I recall that some of the older Gorons
used to play there back{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}when they
were children...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}How's the search for Zelda goin'?


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I've been tryin' to remember anything that
might help us.

But everything's hazy from when I was
wearin' that mask...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So I've given up on trying to recall what
happened then.

Instead, I'm focusing on investigating
around here to see if {{color id="0"}}anything weird{{color id="-1"}}
is happening.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll investigate around here to see if

So don't you worry! You should focus
your energy elsewhere, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Something's been bothering me...

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The blacksmith Rohan and his apprentice,
Fugo, have been arguing a lot.

Sounded like it had to do with the
Boulder Breaker.

Fugo had stopped working because of the
marbled rock roast.

I can't help but feel responsible...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Someone told me that Volcon and Tray
retired from the inn.

Said they had somewhere they needed
to go.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But they don't even know how to find it.
So...they need something to jog their
memory as to the location.
Kinda weird, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The ore YunoboCo provides is high
quality, and we offer it at a low price.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But mining came to a dead halt due to
the marbled rock roast, and we still
haven't caught up on the supply needs.
I feel bad for {{color id="0"}}Ramella{{color id="-1"}}, that {{color id="0"}}Gerudo{{color id="-1"}} who
always treks out here for good ore.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's an old mine we turned into an
amusement park recently!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But we haven't gotten word out much yet,
so it's not seeing much action.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}It's {{color id="0"}}across from{{color id="-1"}} the YunoboCo market
{{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} of Goron City.

The location's not bad at all, but even so,
business is slow...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}We made an amusement park that uses
the old {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}} mine-cart tracks!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But we haven't been able to spread the
word yet, so it's not seein' much action
just yet.
I mean, the location is pretty good, but
the business is struggling...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I heard some chatter recently about a
worker named {{color id="0"}}Mota {{color id="-1"}}who up and vanished.

Mota would've been working in a cave on
the side of {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}mine-cart station {{color id="-1"}}there, so I'm
gonna take a look out that way later and
see what I see.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's a little Goron wanderin' around
the area lately.

He's searching for a place called
{{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}, where Gorons of old
supposedly lived.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}He's really young and probably doesn't
know how to operate the {{color id="0"}}mine carts{{color id="-1"}}...

I'm a bit worried he might hurt himself
tryin' though.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's a Hylian named {{color id="0"}}Kima{{color id="-1"}} who's in
search of some hot springs.

I guess they're called...Simmerstone
Springs?

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Grapp {{color id="-1"}}at the {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs {{color id="-1"}}might

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Link,{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}do you know about {{color id="0"}}perfectly

It can be a real challenge to find, but it's
sooo tasty!

There's a guy at Cooke's {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
Bedrock Bistro, you could check with.

He's a {{color id="0"}}goromand {{color id="-1"}}who can probably talk
your ear off about it.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}If I could try it, even once, I'd die a
happy Goron.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I've heard that {{color id="0"}}Cooke{{color id="-1"}}, the owner of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's a buncha monsters gathering
around a cave to the north of
Death Mountain.
Right now everyone from the

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}The {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew {{color id="-1"}}are really
skilled and deal with this sort of thing
a lot.
Even so, the monsters around here are
intense... I'm kinda worried.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Link, have ya been over to Bedrock
Bistro yet?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}rock-roast pond {{color id="-1"}}is a good marker to
look for its location.

I guess Cooke has been having it out with
a customer...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Cooke's pretty stubborn, so things
will probably stay heated unless
someone intervenes.
{{size value="80"}}Cooke's roasts are so good, but I don't wanna get
mixed up in that mess... What to do...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Have you sorted anything out about the

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Purah said to investigate any ruins from
the {{color id="0"}}age of legends{{color id="-1"}}, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh yeah! {{delay15}}There's a village in the
neighboring {{color id="0"}}Akkala {{color id="-1"}}region called
{{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} that seems worth checking.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}I hear that tons of these things called
Zonai devices are falling from the
sky there!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And it's only a little bit {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}} of here!
I bet it'd be worth the trip...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, I'll search around here to see
whether {{color id="0"}}anything strange {{color id="-1"}}warrants
looking into.
You're free to head wherever you need
to, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Thinking about ruins that originate in the
age of legends...

Maybe {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}} southeast
from here?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If there's tons of Zonai device stuff falling
from the sky, a clue about the {{color id="0"}}fifth sage{{color id="-1"}}
might be there too.
I'll search around here to sniff out
{{color id="0"}}anything strange {{color id="-1"}}that might be happening.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But...I bet you he's on the same page as

Who knows what he's planning—what sort
