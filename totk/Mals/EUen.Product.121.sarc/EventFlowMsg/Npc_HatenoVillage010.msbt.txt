{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Good morning. Are you headed out early?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Have you been traveling long? If you want
to rest, Ton Pu Inn is straight ahead.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}The sun's well and truly set. If you need
a place to stay for the night, I recommend
Ton Pu Inn.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Unfortunate weather, isn't it? The good
news is that Ton Pu Inn straight ahead
from here can offer shelter from the rain.

A few more steps and I can rest.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Errr...sorry about that. Are you a visitor
here? A tourist?{{pageBreak}}You caught me as I was eating my daily
Hateno veggies. {{delay8}}They're very nutritious!{{delay8}}
How else do you think I've lived this long?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Are you hungry, by chance? {{delay8}}I'm in the
middle of my own meal, but...{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}general store{{color id="-1"}} by the village entrance
has a nice selection of seasonal {{color id="0"}}tomatoes{{color id="-1"}}
and such right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}What strange decorations they've been
putting up...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}They've been putting these strange

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You're in Hateno, {{color id="0"}}a village known for
living off the land{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}For as long as anyone can remember,
we've tilled the soil and let nature be
our guide in life.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}Now, though...{{delay8}}everything's getting so
glitzy as some folks try to drum up more
tourism business.{{pageBreak}}Mind you, we were all happy to see {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}
return to the village after she'd been
away for so long.{{pageBreak}}Some folks, like my daughter Prima,
started wearing that flashy {{color id="0"}}Cece-brand{{color id="-1"}}
stuff right away in celebration.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But it's a tad over the top for me and my
son-in-law Worten. We prefer the simple
life, the way we've always lived it.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I'm guessing from the way you dress that
you're not a {{color id="0"}}Cece fan{{color id="-1"}}, traveler.{{pageBreak}}This village started out as a quiet,
peaceful burg where we focused on
living off the land.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Things sure have been different since the
decorations {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}} put up everywhere have
been bringing in the tourists.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I don't mean to talk your ear off.{{delay8}}
By all means, go on and have yourself
a peaceful stay here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Did you know that we're set to hold an
election for mayor here soon, traveler?{{pageBreak}}Sure, I understand Cece's position on
the issues.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But that don't change Hateno's tradition
of living off the land.

There goes the village...

---
label: Talk_04

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Seems like they're getting closer to
holding that election for mayor.{{pageBreak}}Cece is a popular choice with the youth,
seems like. {{delay8}}I suppose it's natural that
things change with the times.{{pageBreak}}But if it was up to me, I'd want Reede to
keep doing it—the way he's always done.

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Won't be long now before they're ready
to hold that election for mayor.{{pageBreak}}Both Reede and Cece mean well for our
village. That much is plain to see.{{pageBreak}}The question on my mind is, what are they
going to do to preserve the traditions we
built this place on?

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Y'know something? I really enjoyed that
Hylian shroom from dear Cece.{{pageBreak}}But in the end, I'm always going to like
carrots better than mushrooms.

Produce and fashion, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Don't I remember seeing you at the
mayoral election?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Well, the election wasn't such a disaster
after all. {{delay8}}I wasn't sure how it would all
come out for a while there.{{pageBreak}}But Cece has a healthy appreciation for
Hateno produce, which is good to know.{{pageBreak}}Maybe I should give those weird outfits
and decorations she makes another
chance, for fairness' sake.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Reede's not resting on his laurels after
winning another term as mayor.{{pageBreak}}I hear he's hard at work on a {{color id="0"}}new Hateno
specialty {{color id="-1"}}to follow up Hateno cheese.{{pageBreak}}Last I heard, he and {{color id="0"}}Nack {{color id="-1"}}were putting
their heads together at the pasture near
the village entrance.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Have you tried a {{color id="0"}}sun pumpkin{{color id="-1"}} yet?
They're the new big thing in Hateno!{{pageBreak}}I can't believe they figured out a way to
get Cece's unique flair into a vegetable.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}You can count on Reede to surprise you,
no doubt about that.
