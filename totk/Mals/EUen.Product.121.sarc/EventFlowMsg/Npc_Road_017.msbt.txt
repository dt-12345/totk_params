Wow, just like the rumors...

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, you taking a rest here too?


It's been a long journey. I figured
{{color id="0"}}Tabantha Bridge Stable {{color id="-1"}}was a good
place to stop and catch my breath.
And with all the tall trees nearby, it was
easy to spot from far away.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There are lots of tall trees around here,
which make the stable easy to find from
far away.
It's always a good idea to make note of
a few landmarks as you travel. {{delay15}}Do that,
and you'll never get lost.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there! You taking a pit stop too?


You may be surprised to learn that before
the Upheaval, this stable was more north.

When the cold snap hit {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}, business
froze up and they had to relocate.

I'm sure it's no accident they moved in
next to a geoglyph. Good chance to make
some dough off the sightseer crowd.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! Word has it there's actually a {{color id="0"}}giant
monster {{color id="-1"}}prowling around {{color id="0"}}north {{color id="-1"}}of
the geoglyph.
So if you're passing that way, be sure to
keep an eye out.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Word has it there's a giant monster
prowling around {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} of the geoglyph.{{pageBreak}}You take care of yourself, OK?

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Travelers like us always have to be wary
of wind and rain.{{pageBreak}}If you're not careful, the chill will sap your
strength and you won't be able to flee
when you need to.
In short, don't be reckless, or you'll get
yourself hurt.

label: RainPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you get too cold, it'll sap your strength
and you won't be able to flee when you
need to. Best not to be reckless.

label: RainRun

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Brr!{{delay15}} Rain's making me chilly. I better go
get under something.

label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Busy day?


You know, there used to be an awful—
and I mean awful—thunderstorm raging
throughout this whole area.
It never let up...{{delay8}}until recently it did.
Which is why I was able to come here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now that it's safer, maybe I should climb
a tall tree and scope things out.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I'm going to climb a tree and look
around, I should do it soon. Never know
when that horrible storm will kick back up.

---
label: Greeting
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Busy day? At least with all the tall
trees around here, you don't have to
worry about getting lost.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look at that structure.{{delay15}} Gotta be...{{delay8}}one of
the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Towers{{color id="-1"}}, right?{{pageBreak}}It's big, that thing! I bet it'd be easy to
spot from a distance.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Maybe I'll use it as a {{color id="0"}}landmark{{color id="-1"}} when
I'm traveling.

Always helps to have a {{color id="0"}}landmark{{color id="-1"}}. That
way, if you get mixed up, you can turn
yourself the right way around!

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Since the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Towers {{color id="-1"}}are so easy to
see from far away, they're good for
{{color id="0"}}keeping oriented {{color id="-1"}}during a long journey.

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When I left on my journey, I used the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}as a landmark to keep
track of my direction.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But down in this valley, I can't see it,
so I'm getting all mixed up.

If I could only scale the cliffs here,{{delay8}} I'd be
able to see the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}and figure
out which way to go.

---
label: GoRange_03_2

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}When I left on my journey, I used the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}as a landmark to keep
track of my direction.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If I could only scale the cliffs here, I'd be
able to get a good look at it and wouldn't
feel quite so lost.

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! You look preoccupied, so I won't
keep you long.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It's just... {{delay15}}I saw sunken treasure in a
pond on the hill near {{color id="0"}}Ludfo's Bog{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Seems a shame to leave perfectly good
treasure chests down there.{{delay8}} I wonder if
there's a way to lift them out...

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those poor treasure chests lying there,
unopened, in that pond on the hill near
{{color id="0"}}Ludfo's Bog{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wish there was a way to get them out...

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Those {{color id="0"}}Skyview Towers {{color id="-1"}}are easy to pick
out on the horizon, huh?{{delay8}} That's why they
make such good landmarks!{{pageBreak}}Though the sky islands are grander,
of course. If ever I'm lost, I know I can
look up at them to find my way.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Is there some way to reach them?
As a consummate traveler, I'd love to
go up there just once...

---
label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Got a lot to do today?


When I'm traveling, I love to take in the
sight of sky islands floating overhead.

---
label: BackRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But from down here, you can't see them
at all... {{delay8}}It's eerie.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If I could scale the cliffs, I'd be able to
see them and the Skyview Towers again.
Then I'd feel much better.

Eastward, then.

label: Near_GoalPoint_01

Where to? Hm...

Will the rain ever let up?

Rain. Not my day.

I've gotta get to shelter.

Just once, I wanna climb it.

It really stands out.

I can't see them...

What can I do?

It's so high up...

tough to deal with on my own.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you so much! If you hadn't shown
up when you did, I'd be done for!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Whew, that was close! {{delay8}}Who taught you to
fight like that?
