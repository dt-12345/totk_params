{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}You! I heard what you did!{{pageBreak}}Helping Bolson rebuild the village?
That's amazing. Truly.{{pageBreak}}When I heard everyone talk about a hero
saving the village, I thought it might have
been you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you so much. I know my father,
Rozel, is grateful too.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}I heard about you.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're him, right? {{delay8}}The person who helped
Bolson rebuild the village?{{pageBreak}}Thank you so much! My father, Rozel,
speaks very highly of you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You know, I was living with my husband
in Hateno Village until not too long ago.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When we heard those monsters occupying
the village were driven out, we decided to
come and look around for ourselves.

label: Talk1019

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Overall, I'd say it's looking mostly as it
did before.{{pageBreak}}I was born and raised here, so I really
appreciate all you've done for this village.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, I'd like to do my part to help get
things going again in Lurelin Village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Problem is, I'm so hungry that I can't
think of ideas. Only food. Like one {{color id="0"}}meal{{color id="-1"}}
that I ate long ago...{{pageBreak}}Hylian rice cooked with Goron spice
and porgy. Mmm!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}{{size value="80"}}Ugh... Thinking about it just makes me hungrier.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}With a few forkfuls of that in my stomach,
I'd have the brainpower to come up with
an idea for livening up the village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But where am I going to find that {{color id="0"}}meal{{color id="-1"}}?
Not here, that's for sure. The ingredients
aren't easy to come by.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I want to liven up the village somehow,
but I'm so hungry. I can't think of ideas...
only a delicious {{color id="0"}}meal {{color id="-1"}}I ate once.
The recipe called for Hylian rice,
Goron spice, and mighty porgy or
armored porgy—{{delay8}}either would work.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}{{size value="80"}}Ugh. Just thinking about it makes me so
very hungry...

What smell?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Apologies. I'm so hungry, I suppose I'm

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Aaah!{{delay8}} This smell! This is the dish I've
been dreaming of!{{pageBreak}}You made it for me? {{delay8}}Thank you so much!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}And now...I eat!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}*slurp* *slurp* That spicy flavor, balanced
by a strong note of umami...{{pageBreak}}It's just too delicious!

label: Talk1025

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}*sigh* So satisfying! At laaast, I can start
thinking of ways to draw in visitors.
Let's see...
Wait... Oh no...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hot! Hot!{{pageBreak}}The Goron spice is burning me up! I can't
focus when my whole body's on fire!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What do I do? I need a {{color id="0"}}gust of wind{{color id="-1"}} to
cool me down...

---
label: Talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Somehow the spice from that dish is
still lingering.{{pageBreak}}I'm burning up so much, I can't focus!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Maybe if there was a {{color id="0"}}gust of wind {{color id="-1"}}to
quench this heat...

Come on, wind! Blow!

for the village!{{pageBreak}}That'll help draw in visitors and liven up
the community!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Time to start working on the design!

---
label: Talk1032

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Really. I couldn't have dreamed up such
a great idea without your help.

Now, I think I'll go liven up Lurelin Village
with a new flag!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Here. {{delay8}}It's the fabric I used for the flag.
Maybe you'll find some other use for it.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}If you go to {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village's dye shop{{color id="-1"}}
they can probably help with that.
