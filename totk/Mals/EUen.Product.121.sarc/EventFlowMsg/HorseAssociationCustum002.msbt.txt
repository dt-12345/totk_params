Scenic spots?

---
label: Talk_0010

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Great!{{delay8}} Let's get scenic!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My first suggestion has to be the
stable nearby.{{pageBreak}}It's called {{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable{{color id="-1"}}. You'll find it if
you take the road toward the east, at the
edge of Lake Floria.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}From there, my next suggestion's nearby.
Go farther east, turn south at the ocean,
and you'll reach a resort town.
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}, it's called. The perfect
place for weary travelers looking to relax!

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wait... What am I thinking?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We got word the other day that pirates
attacked Lurelin Village.{{pageBreak}}Since then, I haven't heard a peep about
the town's fate.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}So, what I said about Lurelin Village being
a good place to relax? Scratch that.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}The village was attacked by pirates
recently. Isn't that awful?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Thankfully, someone chased them off,
so it should be safe now. And I hear
rebuilding efforts are underway.

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I've got plenty more scenic spots
to recommend! {{delay8}}Just say the word!

---
label: 0002
---
Lay 'em on me!

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}All right!{{delay8}} Here's a location that's been a
mystery long as anyone can remember.
A good spot for true adventure!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}To reach it, first ride north until you enter
a thickly wooded forest.{{pageBreak}}Then travel east until you cross Floria
River—and there, go immediately north
into a rain forest.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You will find yourself what folks have
long called...{{delay8}}the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. Very old
ruins—VERY old!{{pageBreak}}I can't imagine a better place for steeping
yourself in nature's beauty and ancient
history at the same time.

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In the air above the Zonai Ruins is a
jet-black thundercloud that's been
there since the Upheaval.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You can see it from here, in fact.{{delay8}} And... {{delay15}}
Am I seeing things, or is there something
inside the cloud?
That's a great scenic spot to visit as well.
Or it would be.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But there's no horse that can get you up
there. The best you can do is gaze at it
from below.

label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}OK! {{delay8}}My third scenic spot is Lake Hylia in
the northwest!{{pageBreak}}Your horse shouldn't go IN the lake, of
course. But you two can take a thrilling
ride across the {{color id="0"}}Bridge of Hylia{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One problem though...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I heard an unsettling rumor.{{delay8}} Sounds like
there's a big monster camping out on
the bridge.{{pageBreak}}If you're as scared of monsters as I am,
you might want to keep your distance.

bridge for a time...{{pageBreak}}But some brave monster slayer sent the
beast to an early grave!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Who that person is, or where they're from,
I don't know...{{delay8}}but if I could, I'd give them

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}All right!{{delay8}} Ready? I saved my favorite
scenic spot for last!{{pageBreak}}Though it's kind of big to be called a
"spot"...{{delay15}} It's the southern coastline!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Picture this—{{delay8}}you and your horse riding
from Martha's Landing to Komo Shoreline
and then Puffer Beach.
You hear the waves lapping against
the beach...{{pageBreak}}feel the cool sea breeze cutting through
your clothes...{{pageBreak}}while your horse's hooves pound faster
and faster against the ground!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ahhh!{{delay8}} There's nothing better!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}On a horse, you'll be able to outrun any
monsters that spot you too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Except...{{delay8}}last time I rode to Puffer Beach,
there was a swarm of flying monsters
waiting for me.
They came screeching out of a cave in
the ceiling of this rocky area. Really
caught me by surprise!
I'm not a flying-thing-ologist, but I guess
they were nesting there?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, those things can move as fast
as horses, so watch out for them.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}Lake of the Horse God{{color id="-1"}} is south
