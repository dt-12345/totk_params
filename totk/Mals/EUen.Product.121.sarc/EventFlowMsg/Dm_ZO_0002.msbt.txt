{{anim type="Ease"}}You...{{delay8}} You saved me!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Thank you...{{delay15}}


How shameful that this should happen
to me, {{delay8}}captain of the guard at Zora's
Domain.{{delay8}} Unbelievable...{{delay15}} Urp!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}After the Upheaval, that filth suddenly
began falling from the sky...

It sullied the waters around here and in
Zora's Domain. Everyone is at their wit's
end because of it.
That is why I set out to investigate the
surrounding area myself.{{delay8}} To think I would
fall prey to falling sludge myself... {{delay8}}Urp!
{{anim type="Sad"}}Just thinking of it makes my scales
bristle...{{delay8}} Urgh... {{delay8}}My gills still feel
so unclean.
If you had not sprayed me with water,
I shudder to think what would have
happened to me...
{{anim type="Ease"}}Please, take this {{color id="0"}}Zora spear{{color id="-1"}} as a token of
my thanks. I am sorry that it is not much,
but it is all I have.
It decayed like all of the other weapons
at the time of the Upheaval, but...{{delay8}} Well, it
is not unusable, at least!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Ah. You have many weapons in
your possession, it would seem.

If you make room and return, I will gift
you this {{color id="0"}}Zora spear{{color id="-1"}}!
