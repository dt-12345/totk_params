Just a bit more...

label: Near_02

I see.

label: Near_03

Not bad.

This one's no good either.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oops... Morning already?


I've been nose down, so I completely lost
track of time.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oops... Afternoon already?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, hey. Is that you, Link?


I've been nose down, so I don't know
what's happening around me half
the time.

---
label: Talk_1_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This's pretty involved, so I'm going to
keep sitting here while I wrench on this.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}You might've heard, but when the
Upheaval happened, all of the
{{color id="0"}}weapons{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}.
I've poured so much energy into trying to
fix them, but it's been no use.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}When the Upheaval happened, all of
the {{color id="0"}}weapons{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}.

I've been {{color id="0"}}attaching various things {{color id="-1"}}to the
tips of weapons.

---
label: 0015
---
Decayed?

---
label: Talk_1_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Yeah. Just before {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}
began pouring out of the ground.

It clung to the weapons, pulsing, as
if alive...

We watched as {{color id="0"}}the weapons rotted to
pieces {{color id="-1"}}right before our eyes.

{{anim type="Think_01"}}It was all pretty wild, and I don't
understand how it happened.

At a time when Hyrule Castle can float,
I've given up trying to make sense of
most things.

Goodbye.

label: Talk_1_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, yeah.


In case nobody has mentioned yet, you're
welcome to the weapons over there.

Though they probably won't be much
use to you, since they're—you guessed
it—{{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_2_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Good work, Link. I heard you helped
a village out of a crisis.

---
label: Talk_2_7
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm trying to repair the {{color id="0"}}decayed weapons{{color id="-1"}},
in the hopes I can help out too.

But try as I might, I come up short.


It seems all you can do is use the
weapons by {{color id="0"}}attaching things to the
ends {{color id="-1"}}of them.

---
label: Talk_6_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, hey. I heard something... Is it true the
Demon King is in the castle?

Which would mean...the gloom that {{color id="0"}}made
the weapons decay{{color id="-1"}} is his fault?

Which also means, once he's gone, I'll be
finished with this work.

---
label: Talk_6_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If the {{color id="0"}}decaying weapons{{color id="-1"}} is this
Demon King guy's doing...

Then that means once he's gone, I'll be
freed up from this work.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yeah. Just before {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}

pieces {{color id="-1"}}right before our eyes,{{delay8}} rendering
them useless.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I couldn't make sense of it at first,
but to think it was the doing of this
Demon King guy...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}At a time when Hyrule Castle can float,
I've given up trying to make sense of
much of anything.
