{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As you can see, my husband is too sick to
move. {{delay8}}I am caring for him here.

This is my fault. I wanted the two of us
to have a wedding adventure. That has
now proved to be unwise.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}He has a weak constitution by nature...
Once before, he collapsed from illness.
A kind traveler helped me treat him then.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I have since pushed myself to know the
ways of medicine. It was only a matter of
time before he would need more help.
The return of my husband's illness is...{{delay15}}
my fault.{{delay15}} But I know what it will take to
heal him this time.
A medicine made from Gleeok guts.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}A Gleeok is a horrible creature that flaps
across the sky using huge wings.

I know there's one that flies over
Gerudo Canyon, but attacking it would
be difficult.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I will need to prepare somehow.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}My husband collapsed all because I
insisted we go on a wedding adventure.
I should not have pushed for it.
If I had Gleeok guts, I could save him...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}C-could this be? Gleeok guts?! How
did you...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No, there is no time for that. Forgive
me if I go right to making my medicine.
I know I can save him with it.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Sarqso!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}A Gleeok is a horrible creature that flaps
across the sky using huge wings.

The thing has three heads, which gives it
three times the terror. It lords over the
sky from the top of Gerudo Canyon.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}But there's no way I can get the innards
of a creature that flies through the sky.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We have decided to continue our wedding

him harder than I should this time.
Well then...sav'orq!

And, of course, to you!
