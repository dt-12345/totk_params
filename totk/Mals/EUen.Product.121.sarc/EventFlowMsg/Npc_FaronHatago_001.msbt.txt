Oooh, a ring garland!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Welcome to {{color id="0"}}Highland Stable{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}To mark your first visit to
Highland Stable...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Not only is this your first visit to Highland
Stable, you've also {{color id="0"}}registered a horse{{color id="-1"}}!
So here...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And, as a token appreciation for your first
time {{color id="0"}}lodging with us{{color id="-1"}} at Highland Stable...

label: Talk_1000

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Have you looked at the sky to
the northeast?

There's an unnatural black cloud over
there. Lots of lightning.{{delay8}} It gives me
the creeps.
It hasn't moved since the Upheaval. Not
even a strong wind can make it budge.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What do you think is going on there?

---
label: Talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Have you looked at the sky to
the northeast?

There used to be an ominous black cloud
over there. Constant lightning. It was
enough to make me shiver.
It appeared after the Upheaval, but then
one day...poof!

It disappeared. All that's left is a new
floating island.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What do you think happened there?

---
label: Talk_2000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Did you hear?{{delay8}} There was a fire north of
the stable the other day. Just a small one,
thank goodness.
Apparently it was started by a young
flute player who was staying with us.
I heard he set off fireworks as a prank.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Hmph. Can you imagine? I haven't seen
him since. Maybe he ran away.

---
label: Talk_2002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}By the way, I heard a rumor from a pair
of travelers the other day about a
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.
They hadn't actually laid eyes on this
white horse themselves yet.

But they were planning to take the road to
the {{color id="0"}}Lake of the Horse God southeast of
here{{color id="-1"}} and search for it there.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Now, I can hardly leave my work at the
stable, {{delay8}}but I'd sure like to see that {{color id="0"}}giant
white stallion{{color id="-1"}} if it exists.

---
label: Talk_2003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hold on...{{delay15}} That horse there...{{delay15}}is {{color id="0"}}white{{color id="-1"}}
and,{{delay8}} uh,{{delay8}} rather {{color id="0"}}large {{color id="-1"}}compared to the
other horses.
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Haha...{{delay15}} but there's no way it could be
THE {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}...is...there?{{delay15}}
HA! Ignore me. I'm just being foolish.

---
label: Com_Photo_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It's such an impressive frame, it's sure to
be the focus of the stable. But now I need
an impressive painting to go inside it.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I was thinking, I heard this rumor the
other day about this rare horse...this
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sounds impressive, doesn't it? I mean,
a white horse is pretty rare, but a giant
one? And it lives nearby, they say!
A {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}of an impressive creature
like a {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion {{color id="-1"}}would suit
that frame perfectly.{{delay8}} I'm sure of it!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Of course, the folks who told me about
this horse hadn't actually seen it with
their own eyes yet.
They were planning to take the road to
the {{color id="0"}}Lake of the Horse God southeast of
here{{color id="-1"}} and search for it there.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If I knew for sure it was there, I would go
try to get a look at it.{{delay8}} *sigh* But I can't
leave work for a rumor.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I wish I had some kind of {{color id="0"}}picture of that
giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}. If I did, I'd use it for
reference and whip up a painting of it.

---
label: Com_Photo_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}A big frame like that is sure to be the
centerpiece of the stable, which means
I've got to put the perfect painting in it.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So you know that rumor I told you about?{{delay8}}
The one about the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I was thinking...a white horse is rare, but
a GIANT white horse? Incredible!{{delay15}} And it
lives nearby, I hear.
A painting of that {{color id="0"}}giant stallion {{color id="-1"}}would go
perfect inside that frame.{{delay8}} I'm sure of it.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I just need to get a look at a {{color id="0"}}picture of
that giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}, then I could
paint a copy and hang it on the wall.

---
label: Com_Photo_01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That reminds me, I feel like I remember
seeing a {{color id="0"}}very large white horse{{color id="-1"}} among
the horses we're looking after for you...{{delay15}}
{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}No...{{delay8}}that's not possible, is it?{{delay15}} Anyway,
I'd really like to see it, even just a picture
of it.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait, you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the
giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion {{color id="-1"}}would be perfect
for that frame.{{delay8}} I'm sure of it.

But I don't think anyone's ever actually
seen that horse.{{delay8}} Maybe it's not even real.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The pair of travelers who told me about
it seemed so sure though.

They were going to take the road to
the {{color id="0"}}Lake of the Horse God southeast
of here{{color id="-1"}} and search for it there.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Wish I knew if that horse was real. I can't
exactly drop my work and leave the stable
to chase after a rumor.

---
label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The giant white stallion... Does it truly
exist?{{delay8}} Just how giant IS it?

Aah, if only I had a {{color id="0"}}picture of the
giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} It would be perfect
for that frame!

---
label: 9001
---
Here's a picture.

---
label: 9002
---
I hope you find one.

---
label: 9003
---
I'm not showing you.

---
label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Are you serious? You're going to show
me {{color id="0"}}the giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Any image of it will do. If I can see what
the{{color id="0"}} giant white stallion looks{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}like {{color id="-1"}}up close,
I can paint a copy.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But do you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the
giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}? That would be
something to behold!

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, what a sight for sore eyes!


With that {{color id="0"}}picture of a{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}
copied, I can proudly display it whenever
I want!
Or, if you'd rather I switch it for a
different one, just show me the
new picture!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It gets more enchanting the more you look
at it, doesn't it? Ah, such a fine horse...{{delay15}}

If only I could ride the giant white stallion.
We would race across the wide plains...

{{anim type="LaughS"}}At my age, what's another dream to add
to the pile, eh?

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks to you, Link, the frame has the
picture it deserves. The stable has a
whole new feeling with it here.
The giant white stallion is a symbol of
hope—that there's always a chance any
day something great can happen.
Oh, such as...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}What if someone rode up to the stable
on the real giant white stallion one day?{{delay15}}
Can you imagine?

---
label: Talk_2004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Uh...{{delay15}}your horse...


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}No, never mind...{{delay8}} I must be mistaken.{{delay8}}
Yeah, that must be it. Hahaha...

No one would just ride up here astride
THE {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}. Nope. No way!{{delay8}}
Unless...it was...a dream...

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} was there something you
wanted to do with the {{color id="0"}}painting of
the giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Folks are saying that they want to ride the
giant white stallion! {{delay8}}Oho, it's such an
inspiring picture!

---
label: 9006
---
I want to change it.

---
label: 9007
---
I want to leave it as is.

---
label: DoNotWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}You can't take that with you, sir.{{delay15}}
The association wants it displayed
at all times.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}Pretty, isn't it? The name comes from the
ring-shaped ruins in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

I hear you can find them in the village, so
why don't you go there if you want one?

Kakariko's northeast of the Skyview Tower
by the Dueling Peaks.

---
label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'm sorry, but you can't take that. If you
want your own, you'll have to go all the
way to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}To get there, head northeast from the
Skyview Tower by the Dueling Peaks.
You'll see a village in the valley.
They sell these decorations there.

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You can buy one of these decorations
in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. It's a little far, but
I'm sure you can manage.
Just go northeast from the Skyview Tower
near Dueling Peaks. You'll run into the
village soon enough.
