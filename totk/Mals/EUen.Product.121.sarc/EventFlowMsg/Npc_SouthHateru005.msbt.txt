{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome to Dueling Peaks Stable!

label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, welcome!

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, Darton! There's a customer!
You have to say "welcome"!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, Darton! That guy is here! You have
to say "welcome"!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those footprints... Were they like this? No, I'm sure
they were like this...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry. We're supposed to say
"welcome" together, but...

Darton is obsessed with drawing
those {{color id="0"}}footprints{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 0009
---
Footprints?

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We found some strange footprints south
of here in Faron!

They were big. No animal I know leaves
tracks like that. They were {{color id="0"}}footprints no
one's ever seen before{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}We went to tell our dad right away, but...
they disappeared in the rain.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}He said we probably just dreamed 'em up.


But we did see them! Really, we did!

---
label: 0011

I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Dartonnnnn!


I'm glad you're drawing the {{color id="0"}}strange
footprints{{color id="-1"}} so we don't forget, but you
HAVE to say "welcome"!

---
label: Talk_0049
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You see the weirdest stuff down south in
Faron, huh?

Wait, Darton, that's not it! Weren't they
more wiiide?

---
label: Talk_0050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Wide? No, they were definitely
more broaaad...

---
label: Talk_0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Stupid rain, washing those footprints away
before we could get a good look.

I wish it didn't rain so much around there.

---
label: Talk_0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Darton, wasn't this part of the {{color id="0"}}footprint{{color id="-1"}}
more like stomp-stomp?

---
label: Talk_0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? What does that even mean?
More stamp-stamp, maybe...

---
label: Talk_0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Mr. Traveler! Are you interested in
these {{color id="0"}}footprints{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, Mr. Traveler! I'll tell you about
these {{color id="0"}}footprints{{color id="-1"}}, but you have to
promise to believe us!

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry. We're supposed to say
"welcome" together, but...

Darton is obsessed with Dondons now.

---
label: Talk_0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Darton, isn't this part of the Dondon
more like boooom?

---
label: Talk_0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? No, I think it's more like blaaam.

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome to Dueling Peaks Stable!


If you want to use the stable, then go
ahead and talk to Dad... I mean, the man
at the counter!

label: Talk_0048

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}M-mister! Welcome!

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome to Dueling Peaks Stable!


One of the many things we do great here
is keep you dry from the rain!

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Shibooo, come on, come onnn!

---
label: Talk_0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Shibo, come on! We'll get wet!

---
label: Talk_0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Shibo, come on! We need to strategize
about the {{color id="0"}}footprints{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Darton, you can't do that! You have to
say "welcome"!

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Didn't I already say it, mister?

---
label: Talk_0003

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Didn't I already say it, mister?


Wait, is it raining? Let's get inside, quick!

This bit was like this...

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We found strange footprints when we
went to Faron, but...

Nobody believes us.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Darton, did you hear that?! The footprints
we saw were the real deal!

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}A Dondon, huh? And only five have ever
been found in the whole world?!

That's why nobody knew about it!


And Dad said we were dreaming. Ha!
I can't wait to see the look on his face
when we tell him!

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Wow! Thanks!


Travelers go to so many places and learn
so many things—it's just amazing.

That's why I drew the footprints. I hoped
a traveler would see them and teach us
something amazing too.

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Hey, Shibo! Can I give him that thing?

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Yeah! I think he's earned it.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}OK! Ahem-hem. We are presenting you
with one of our finest treasures.

---
label: Talk_0042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We feed this to horses when we want to
{{color id="0"}}tame{{color id="-1"}} them.

---
label: Talk_0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We pooled our money and bought it in
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, which is up the road
right here to the north.
Thanks for telling us about the Dondon!

---
label: Talk_0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey, Darton, let's try drawing a picture of
that Dondon!

---
label: Talk_0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yeah!

---
label: Talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ummm... It has a big, round body... The
tusks are REALLY long...and its tail is...

Yeah! That's it!

---
label: Talk_0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}It's like you took it right out of my
brain, Darton!

Just wait until Dad sees THIS!

---
label: Talk_0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Huh? Looks like you can't take it. You're
holding too many things, mister.

I thought I'd give you a {{color id="0"}}swift carrot{{color id="-1"}}
I bought with Shibo when I went to
Kakariko Village...
Talk to me again when you're able to
carry it!

---
label: Talk_0057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, mister! Did you make some room in
what you're carrying?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Huh? It looks like you're still holding
too many things.

I'll give you a {{color id="0"}}swift carrot{{color id="-1"}} when you have
room. So let's talk again once you've
done that!

---
label: Talk_0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, mister! You must have made room in
what you're carrying! Then I'll give you
this, like I said!

label: Near_17

We're off welcome duty!

---
label: Talk_0023

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've got to get to sleep...

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Foot...prints... I definitely...saw...them...

---
label: Near_11
---
Aaah, it's rainiiing!

---
label: Talk_0022

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I hope Darton comes back soon.

It must be real!
