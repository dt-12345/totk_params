{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Link! Welcome back!

---
label: GrandFinale_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link! Have you seen?


The sludge has vanished without a trace!

---
label: GrandFinale_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link. Thanks to your courage,
the inhabitants of Zora's Domain
are safe once again.
No words could express the depths of my
gratitude. Thank you, hero. From the
bottom of my heart, I thank you.

---
label: GrandFinale_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}As for you, Sidon...


Though Link certainly played a key role,
your own efforts to save the domain were
nothing short of magnificent.

---
label: GrandFinale_16
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I have always believed in you, Sidon.
Now, you have unequivocally proven
your worthiness to bear the crown.

---
label: GrandFinale_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}That is why I shall joyously take this
opportunity to pass the throne to you.

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Father... This is so sudden...

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}No, it only seems that way. In truth, it has
been heavy on my mind for some time.

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Sidon, my son...


{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It is time to ascend the throne as the new
king. Take Yona's hand, and as one, lead
Zora's Domain to a brighter tomorrow.

---
label: GrandFinale_13

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Me... The king?

...

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Thank you, Father! I will not let you down!
I swear it.

---
label: GrandFinale_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That is the spirit, my boy!

---
label: GrandFinale_15
---
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Now! Accept your place upon the throne.
The finest swordsman in all of Hyrule shall
bear witness to this momentous occasion!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Silence, everyone!{{delay frames="75" otherArg="0x0000"}}

label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I hereby inherit this crown from my father,
The Exalted Dorephan. From this moment
on, I shall be king of the Zora!

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoAizuchi_01"}}At this same precious moment, I ask that
you also open your hearts to your new
queen, my beloved Yona!

---
label: GrandFinale_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_02"}}The sludge threatens us no more. We are
once again free to swim through crystal
waters beneath azure skies without fear.

---
label: GrandFinale_23
---
We could not have achieved this without
our dear King Sidon, our heroic Sir Link,
and all of us who call the domain home.

---
label: GrandFinale_26
---
I am so proud and so very grateful
to count myself among the Zora of
the domain.

---
label: GrandFinale_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}However! That does not mean that all
matters have been resolved.

---
label: GrandFinale_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Convinced_00"}}Right you are, my love!

---
label: GrandFinale_28
---
So long as darkness lurks in the depths of
Hyrule, this peace we have fought so hard
for could vanish like a bubble on a needle.

---
label: GrandFinale_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}We shall not allow that! It is now time for
the Zora to help Link prevail! Everyone,
I ask that you lend him your strength!

---
label: GrandFinale_32
---
{{anim type="ShidoInspire_00"}}Doing just that shall be the first task that I
and my partner in life and in leadership
shall undertake as your king and queen.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}First things first, my friend. Regarding the
whereabouts of Princess Zelda...

---
label: GrandFinale_40
---
When I obtained the secret stone, we saw
a vision of that woman...the Sage of Time.

---
label: GrandFinale_41
---
{{anim type="Think_01"}}She bore an uncanny resemblance to
Princess Zelda. What if...that is indeed
who it was?

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_56
---
{{anim type="Angry_01"}}No... I am getting carried away. That
simply is not possible, is it?

My ancestor lived in the distant past. It is
difficult to imagine how the two could
have crossed paths.
There is little chance that Princess Zelda
somehow ended up in ancient Hyrule.

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}In any case, what we desperately need
right now is more information!

---
label: GrandFinale_34

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}First things first, my friend. Regarding the
whereabouts of Princess Zelda...

---
When I obtained the secret stone, we saw
a vision of that woman...the Sage of Time.

---
label: GrandFinale_43
---
{{anim type="Think_01"}}The resemblance was uncanny, and she
also knew your name...

Could that have been the real
Princess Zelda?

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_60
---
{{anim type="Angry_01"}}If by some strange occurrence that is so,
that would mean she has journeyed to the
bygone era of my ancient ancestor.
Hm, and yet Father was attacked by
Princess Zelda in the here and now...
It does not add up.

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Well, one thing we know for certain is that
we need to know more!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}First things first, my friend. Regarding the
whereabouts of Princess Zelda...

---
When I obtained the secret stone, we saw
a vision of that woman...the Sage of Time.

---
label: GrandFinale_45
---
{{anim type="Think_01"}}I am certain it was far more than a passing
resemblance. That was the Princess Zelda
whom you and I know so well.

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_64
---
{{anim type="Angry_01"}}As for the Princess Zelda who appeared
in the domain and attacked Father...

Could it be that the princess we saw in my
ancestor's era and the one my father saw
in this era are not one and the same?

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Hm... Questions upon questions. It is
painfully clear that we have no choice but
to find the princess and ask her directly!

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_68
---
{{anim type="Angry_01"}}In stark contrast, the look-alike sighted in
the present day is harming others and
even attacked Father.
As such, I can only believe that our
princess is somehow in the bygone era
of my ancient ancestor.
However, if my hunch is correct, what is
the true identity of the Princess Zelda
who is running rampant in this era?

---
label: DmF_ZO_GrandFinale_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Hm. Whatever the answer, it is painfully
clear that we have no choice but to find
her and ask her directly!

Link. As I have just ascended the throne,
I must offer my sincerest apologies for
being unable to accompany you.

---
label: GrandFinale_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Still, I shall continue gathering information
about our lost Princess Zelda.

---
label: GrandFinale_39

Please promise that you shall once again
grace our fair Zora's Domain with your
presence sooner rather than later!

---
label: GrandFinale_48

{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Whatever comes to pass, know that you
and I will always be connected...by the
power of a sage, no less!

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}That reminds me... Link, you have not
yet visited Lookout Landing, correct?

I believe they, too, are searching for
Princess Zelda and investigating the
phenomena occurring across Hyrule.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It can be found south of Hyrule Castle.
It may be worthwhile to venture there
and report your findings.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}That reminds me...


Link, as I understand it, you have
already visited Rito Village, Goron City,
and Gerudo Town.
{{anim type="Think_00"}}I am certain that our allies at Lookout
Landing would benefit from the
information you have gathered.
It may be worthwhile to return there and
report your findings.
