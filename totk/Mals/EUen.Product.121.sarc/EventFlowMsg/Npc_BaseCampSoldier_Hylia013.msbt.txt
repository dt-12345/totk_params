{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Purah turned Lookout Landing into the

Originally, she established this fort to
study the gloom that started seeping
from Hyrule Castle.
Only researchers and members of the
Zonai Survey Team worked here.

But once the princess went missing,
everyone wanted to help, so they've
been coming in ever since.
We're like one big, growing family.

The tunnel's quite old and neglected—{{delay8}}
it looks ready to cave in at any moment.
I think we'd all do well to stay away.
Since it was found, {{color id="0"}}Jerrin{{color id="-1"}}, who's in charge

she's scared of something.

I wonder what could have happened.

Josha was upset and asking Robbie why

the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.
{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm sure she'd have a lot of insights if she
went down there, considering how brilliant
she is.
But she's still very young, so it wasn't
surprising to me that she's not allowed

I don't know any details, but it sounds

A few interviewees went to meet with
