{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}*yaaawn*{{delay15}} My head's still all fuzzy...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh! You're... Hang on. What are you
doing here?

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, oh, yeah! Now I remember! It all
happened so suddenly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The Great Deku Tree was in agony, and
ominous fog came out of his mouth...

And THEN! A bunch of us Koroks started
acting funny.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Next thing I knew, monsters showed up,
and I fought them all by myself, knocking
them out one by one by one!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Um... Sorry.{{delay15}} I lied. I actually couldn't
move and don't even remember
what happened.
It was all so sudden... I don't know if any
of the others remember either.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But thanks to you, Mr. Hero, everybody is
back to normal! Yay!

I'm sure the Great Deku Tree wants to
say thank you too! You should go!

The Great Deku Tree?

---
label: 0001
---
We already met.

label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}As everyone knows, the Great Deku Tree
is the spirit of Korok Forest!

If you climb up the root behind me, you
can talk with him.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're the one who saved the Great Deku
Tree's life, so please go say hello!

---
label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, you already met up?


The Great Deku Tree has been alive much
longer than us Koroks, so he's kinda stoic
and doesn't always show his feelings.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But I'm sure that he's thankful and happy
for what you did! And so am I!

---
label: Talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Because of you,{{delay8}} Korok Forest has
returned to being peaceful again.
Thank you!
Oh, have you met with the Great Deku
Tree yet? If you still haven't, well then,
you should!

---
label: Talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh yeah, also! Some of the Koroks could
use your help.

You should probably talk to the Great
Deku Tree first, but then maybe you
can help out...

---
label: Talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And I've got a favor to ask! Some of the
Koroks could use your help...

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Follow the lights in the forest...

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you do, you'll come across different
Koroks who could use your help. Please
go find them, and see what they need!

---
label: Talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You...{{delay15}} This is perfect! I've got a favor
to ask.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Some of the Koroks have had stuff on
their minds lately.

---
label: Talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You should go talk to the Koroks who
need help!

---
label: Talk1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Koroks are happy as can be.
Hmmm, I'm guessing{{delay30}} it's because
of you? Thank you!
