{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Do forgive me, but I need to attend to
other customers at the moment.

So if you need to use the stable, please
speak to the gentleman at the counter.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm so excited for their arrival that I can't

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}There's a group of gourmets who frequent
our stable, and they always teach me new
recipes to cook!
And the recipe for our next session is...{{delay8}}
a dish devised by Princess Zelda herself!

I'm so excited,{{delay8}} I can't even sit still!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}What recipe are they going to teach me
this time?{{delay15}} My mouth is watering just
thinking about it!

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What recipe will I learn this time, you ask?
Why, one devised by none other than
Princess Zelda herself!
I'm just so,{{delay8}} so excited that I can't sit still!

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I was starting to worry for a while there,
but everyone arrived safely!

In fact, I was just asking Agus about the
{{color id="0"}}meat and rice bowl recipe{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, my apologies,{{delay15}} but if you need
something from the stable, please
ask at the counter.
I'm currently trying to learn the {{color id="0"}}meat and
rice bowl {{color id="-1"}}recipe from the renowned
gourmet chef Agus.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It seems that he learned the recipe from
Princess Zelda herself!

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The key is to use raw meat in the dish and
not stray from the recipe. You mustn't get
that wrong!
Clearly,{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}is just as capable
a chef as she is a princess, adventurer,
and all-around delight!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Imagine if we could get her to teach a
cooking class at our stable someday!

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The princess's famed meat and rice bowl!{{delay15}}
You need to use raw meat in the dish and
not tinker with the recipe. That's key.
I'm planning on trying {{color id="0"}}all different kinds
of raw meat {{color id="-1"}}with the recipe, just to really
get a feel for it.

label: Talk_0013

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I was a little worried there for a while,
but everyone arrived safely. What a relief!

to teach me how to make a {{color id="0"}}meat and rice
bowl{{color id="-1"}}! I'm so excited!

label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, forgive me, dear customer. I'm afraid
I'm not going to be of much assistance
right now.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}My mind and heart are occupied with
learning the {{color id="0"}}meat and rice bowl{{color id="-1"}} recipe
from Agus, the gourmet chef.
So if you need something from the stable,
please ask at the counter.
