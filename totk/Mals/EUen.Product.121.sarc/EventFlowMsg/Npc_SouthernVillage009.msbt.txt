{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey, mister. Did you travel here from
the south?

That's right.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh! Did you happen to pass by
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

Nope.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Then... Then maybe you came from
the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Do you know something about
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}So, the {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}} aren't there anymore?
What about the head of the village or the
"son and done" guy—{{delay8}}are they OK?
...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry. I've been really worried about
our village.

I thought about climbing the {{color id="0"}}Skyview
Tower {{color id="-1"}}to get a look, but it's got a bunch
of {{color id="0"}}spike {{color id="-1"}}thingies around it...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But that's OK. If something happened,
Dad would tell us.

I just have to be a good kid and wait!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We used to live in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}But then the {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} sailed in on a
big boat and attacked us.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}They completely tore down our home.
We had to run away.{{pageBreak}}I wish I could climb a Skyview Tower and
see how the village is doing, but...they're
kinda tall...and a little {{color id="0"}}spiky{{color id="-1"}} sometimes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wish I could climb the Skyview Tower

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I had such a good idea. I was going to
climb that {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} to get a good
look at Lurelin Village in the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}}.
But my mom found out and got so mad!
Said it was too dangerous... {{delay8}}Pfft.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}Too bad lectures don't sink pirate ships... My mom
would have freed the village by now!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}With those {{color id="0"}}spikes {{color id="-1"}}everywhere, I can't
even get close. And since it's so {{color id="0"}}wet {{color id="-1"}}now,
burning them won't work either...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I can't get near the tower with those
spikes all over. Maybe I should burn 'em...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Nahhh, just kidding. If I even thought
about doing that, my mom would light
ME on fire.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Whoa, the spikes! Someone burned
them away?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Yesss! Now I can climb the tower!
I'll have to look and see how the village
is doing later.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thank you for burning the spikes!


I think I'll climb that Skyview Tower and
see how {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} is doing! A little
later maybe!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, hey, did you know? Monsters can't
see you as easy when it's {{color id="0"}}raining{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}The old "son and done" guy told me that
back in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}is right next to the water,
so the rain reminds me of home!

the mud on my clothes...
