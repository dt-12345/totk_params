{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}My papa told me you can use {{color id="0"}}ice fruit {{color id="-1"}}to
freeze monsters solid!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Which gave me an amazing idea for an
invention, mwaha.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}My problem is...{{delay15}}I can't go out to pick
fruit right now, with the blizzard and all.

{{anim type="Sad"}}Ugh, it's so not fair! This is the best
invention I've come up with in so long.
But without {{color id="0"}}ice fruit{{color id="-1"}}, I can't make it.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Problem is...{{delay15}}I can't go and pick the fruit,
since Papa always tells me not to go out
on my own.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ugh, it's so not fair! This is the best

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What am I gonna do? Without {{color id="0"}}ice fruit{{color id="-1"}},
I can't make my invention!

You go to all the trouble coming up with
an idea, and it sits there, taking up space
in your head... {{delay15}}Gah!

monsters solid.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Is that {{color id="0"}}white Chuchu jelly{{color id="-1"}}, from one of the
monsters that'll freeze you solid if you
touch it?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wahoo! Waha! {{delay8}}It's not exactly what I
had in mind, but I bet I can use that to
make my big invention!
Oops, I almost forgot. {{delay15}}Manners.{{pageBreak}}May I please have one, mister, sir?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Wow! {{delay8}}It's not exactly what I had in
mind, but I bet I can use that to make
my big invention!
May I have one of either the {{color id="0"}}ice fruit {{color id="-1"}}or
the {{color id="0"}}white Chuchu jelly{{color id="-1"}}, please?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Sometimes I'm so smart, I scare myself
a little.{{pageBreak}}I wonder what would happen with {{color id="0"}}other
materials{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay8}}You could make {{color id="0"}}arrows with

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Wow, listen to me. With every breath,
I spew out brilliance! {{delay8}}Fwaaa!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}But I should probably stop talking before
