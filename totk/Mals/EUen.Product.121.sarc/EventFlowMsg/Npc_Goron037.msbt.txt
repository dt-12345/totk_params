{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Hey there! You just passing through?
Mind if I yammer at ya for a sec?

I've heard things have gotten pretty
bad in {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}.

The workers aren't working, includin' my
pals at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}} who live to work!

Do you know what's goin' on over there?
I'm worried...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Word is things are still real bad in
{{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}.

My pals at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo {{color id="-1"}}still aren't working.
What could be goin' on...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}As a traveler, I figured you might know
something about whatever's happening
in {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}.
I heard that my pals at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}
have shut down production and are
sittin' on their haunches.
Just what's goin' on?{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}From what I've been hearin', {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}} is
back in business!

Which means I'd better hurry up and
finish work out here so I can get back
to {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo HQ{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You a traveler?{{delay15}}


Careful, now. The ground is uneven, what
with all the debris everywhere. I wouldn't
wander around too much, if I were you.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sounds like {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}} is up and running

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That's the mining team founded by our
wonderful President Yunobo. Or Prez
for short.
If ya see someone wearin' a blue uniform
with a pickax logo on it, they work for
{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}. Like me!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Normally, we'd be off minin' ore outta
caves near {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}, but lately a buncha
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} fell down in the area.
I heard the folks out here needed help
clearin' it all out, so I came to pitch in.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's home to all Gorons, located {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}
of here in the Eldin region.

If ya look off that way, you can see
{{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}. Goron City's at the
base of it.
But lately the mountain's been looking
kinda...{{delay8}}different. Makes a fella
uneasy, yanno?
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Aside from that, I've also been hearin'
{{color id="0"}}bothersome things {{color id="-1"}}about the Gorons back
home. I'm so worried, I can barely work...
See, we Gorons are a friendly and
hard-workin' sort. We never get up
to any kind of trouble.
But I'm told even my pals at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}
have stopped production. Somethin's
just not right...
