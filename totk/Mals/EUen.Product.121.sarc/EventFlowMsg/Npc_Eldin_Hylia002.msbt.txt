{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ugh... Even if I wanted to move the {{color id="0"}}cart{{color id="-1"}}...
it won't be happening with the safety
officer so preoccupied.
You heard of this stuff called {{color id="0"}}marbled
rock roast{{color id="-1"}}?

Ever since {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo {{color id="-1"}}started
mining it, everyone's been too busy
with it to care about work.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I haven't touched it, so I'm doing fine.
I get the sense that stuff's just not great
for ya.

today. I can't believe {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo{{color id="-1"}}
got everyone eating those {{color id="0"}}weird rocks{{color id="-1"}}.
