{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ha, no. I'm getting carried away. {{delay8}}In any

this is the best spot!
That's all thanks to Prince Sidon.
He's cleaning the water in Mipha
Court, which is up above!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}That's right. They're playing as though
they're our beloved king.

All I heard was something about
"the sludge" and "you monsters!"

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It seemed like a strange game,
to be honest.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I'm just grateful they can play like that in
the {{color id="0"}}throne room{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} That means I don't
have to worry about them!
