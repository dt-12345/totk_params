{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh, hey. {{delay8}}Wasn't expecting to run into
another Hylian here.

Traveling around these parts isn't exactly
easy, what with the Gorons acting all
weird and whatnot.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I swear, you can't hardly carry on a
conversation with 'em anymore.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Ugh, I can't believe I went to so much
trouble to travel to Goron City and find
Simmerstone Springs...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, hey. {{delay8}}You here in Goron City for a bit
of sightseeing too?

If so, you've got some perfect timing!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Up until recently, the Gorons were acting
real weird.

You could barely even hold a simple
conversation with 'em.

The second those strange red stones
vanished, well, they came right to
their senses.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Good news is, I can finally go looking
for Simmerstone Springs,{{delay8}} which is why
I came here in the first place.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Don't tell me you've never heard of
{{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}

What?{{delay15}} Really?


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Eh...{{delay8}}I mean...{{delay8}}if I'm bein' honest, I guess 
I don't really know that much about
the place either.
I just know there's this secret hot spring
called Simmerstone Springs somewhere
near Goron City.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But, well, I guess that's what makes
it a SECRET hot spring. {{delay8}}Only those in
the know...know about it! Ya know?
What I think I'm gonna do is try to talk
to some {{color id="0"}}hot-spring buffs {{color id="-1"}}at the not-secret
hot springs. See if they know where it is.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hmm...I suppose {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}} is a good place
to start.{{delay8}} Maybe I'll look it up on a {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} later.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Eh...{{delay15}}so...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I suppose that's your way of sayin' {{delay8}}
ya don't know anything?

It's just...I'm trying to find this secret hot
spring called Simmerstone Springs.

But I still don't have a clue where it is.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I know. I know. That's what makes it a
SECRET hot spring. Only those in the
know...know where it is.
But I've got an idea. I'm gonna visit some
well-known hot-water hangouts and get
info from the hot-springs buffs there.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hmm...I suppose a good place to start is
{{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}}, eh?{{delay8}} Maybe I'll look it

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You're in such a rush to get outta here...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}There's somethin' suspicious about you!{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, good morning! So, you haven't left
Goron City, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, hello! You're still hanging around

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Well, good evening. So you're still
hanging around Goron City.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Big surprise. The Gorons are still eating 
those weird red stones.

There's no way I can chat with 'em
when they're like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I came to Goron City hoping to find
Simmerstone Springs...but it looks
like I just wasted my time.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Ugh, what's the deal with those red
rocks anyhow?

I went to all kinds of trouble gettin'
myself to Goron City, just hoping I could
find Simmerstone Springs...

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Those strange red rocks have vanished
and the Gorons are all back to actin'
normal.
Finally! Now I can go lookin' for
Simmerstone Springs, which is the
whole reason I came here.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}What was with those red stones,
anyway?

Well, at least I can finally relax and go
hunting for Simmerstone Springs.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}By the looks of it, you haven't found out
anything either.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Guess that's what makes it a secret hot
spring. Only those in the know...know
about it! {{delay8}}But at least the search is fun.
I'm planning to start by visiting the
well-known hot springs. I'll see if I can
get info out of the hot-spring buffs there.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hmm...I suppose {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}} is a good place
to start.{{delay8}} Maybe I'll look it up on a {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} later.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I think I'll start by checking out some well-known hot
springs. See what I can find out while I'm there.{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs {{color id="-1"}}is probably my best bet...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}I-{{delay15}}incredible...

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Yes! This is it! No doubt about it!
This is Simmerstone Springs!

I had heard the entrance was collapsed,
and no one could get in anymore...

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah! Sorry for showing up out of the blue.{{delay8}}
Did you...make this hole?

I heard a loud noise and thought I'd
check it out...

And now, my hot-springs dream has come
true! All thanks to you!

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Truth is, I've been huntin' high and
low for Simmerstone Springs!

It's a secret hot spring and not well
known, even among the Gorons. So, I've
had a hard time figuring out where it was.
But I finally got this Goron—a real
hot-springs buff—to spill some details.
That's why I headed over here.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry for showing up after you did all the
work getting in here...

But, if ya don't mind, there is somethin'
I've been wanting to do...

Pardon me a moment.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The temperature...it's perfect!{{delay8}} And how
about this...

Mmm...{{delay30}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}{{size value="125"}}De...{{delay15}} Delicious!{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}No doubt this is the perfect {{color id="0"}}spring-boiled
egg{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}} It's exactly as good as I hoped it
would be!
Oh,{{delay15}} guess I forgot to mention why I was
lookin' for this place, eh?

It was so I could make this incredible
spring-boiled egg!

Of course, if you hadn't found a way
to get inside, well, I never would've
found it!
So please, you've got to let me give you
a reward.

label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Well then, excuse me, but I'm going
to go ahead...

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Ah, nibbling on the perfect spring-boiled
egg while soaking in the perfect hot
spring! It doesn't get better than this!
Of course, I'm more than happy to share
with you.

Go on, have some if ya like.
