{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Swordsman! This way!

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}So, remember that fragment I had?
The one that showed a single,
mysterious figure?
I found more fragments among the
things our survey team brought back
from the Depths.
And guess what? {{delay8}}They fit together like
puzzle pieces!

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_04"}}Ta-da! Just look!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Feast your eyes upon this amazing mural!


{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}This scene shows that there's a whole
series of statues down there, like the one
you found for me last time.
But what really caught my attention is
{{color id="0"}}the way they're oriented{{color id="-1"}}. Each figure is
pointed toward the next one in the series.
Until it ends with that last statue facing
a final destination—a building that looks
like a {{color id="0"}}temple{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Also, see those large ears on the figure
at the front of the building? That's got to
be one of the Zonai.
And then there's that strange hand
symbol that seems to be responding
to whatever the Zonai is doing.

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}So to collect my thoughts on all of this...


I'm pretty sure if you {{color id="0"}}follow the gaze {{color id="-1"}}of
each of those statues down there, you'll
reach that structure.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'm also betting that the {{color id="0"}}temple-like
building {{color id="-1"}}holds something of Zonai origin.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I've heard that the Zonai wielded
{{color id="0"}}mysterious powers{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay8}}I wonder if this
correlates to those powers.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}You mean to tell me you already found
the temple?!

And? What was in there?!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, all of this is still just
speculation on my part.

Sooo...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}That's where you come in, Swordsman!


I want you to find the {{color id="0"}}temple structure{{color id="-1"}}
depicted in the mural.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Initially I figured I could just go myself,
so I gathered a bunch of {{color id="0"}}brightblooms{{color id="-1"}}
and supplies.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But they pulled the "kid card" on me and
said I couldn't go into {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So...{{delay8}}here.

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This is for your investigation expenses!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You can have these too.

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_03"}}{{color id="0"}}Brightblooms{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}arrows{{color id="-1"}} are perfect for
exploring the Depths!

---
label: Talk_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's the added bonus that checking
out the Depths might provide us with
clues to help find Princess Zelda.

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}So if it all works out, maybe you'll snag
some {{color id="0"}}mysterious power {{color id="-1"}}for yourself AND
gain clues about Princess Zelda!
Nothing but good things, right? Thanks
for your help with this, {{delay8}}Swordsman!

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_02"}}If you {{color id="0"}}follow the gaze{{color id="-1"}} of each statue,
that will lead you to the {{color id="0"}}temple-like
building {{color id="-1"}}with the strange hand symbol.{{delay15}}
Some sort of Zonai figure must be
standing in front of that building.

I have no doubt that this mural originates
from the Zonai civilization.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}It's speculated that the Zonai wielded
{{color id="0"}}mysterious powers{{color id="-1"}}. So maybe...
just MAYBE!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I can feel a big discovery coming on!
Let's figure it out together and then we
can surprise Doc!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Swordsman, what is it? You look very
pleased with yourself...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}C-{{delay15}}could it be?!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}A-{{delay8}}U-{{delay8}}T-{{delay8}}O-{{delay8}}{{delay8}}build{{delay8}}!


With the ability to {{delay8}}INSTANTLY {{color id="0"}}replicate{{color id="-1"}}
things you've built?!

AND schema stones?!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}So there really was a Zonai temple
housing a {{color id="0"}}mysterious power{{color id="-1"}} down in
{{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm...{{delay8}} That may also mean...that some of
the {{color id="0"}}things collected{{color id="-1"}} from {{color id="0"}}the Depths {{color id="-1"}}may
give us other clues...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Wait here just a sec!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Wow. So there really was a Zonai temple
housing a {{color id="0"}}mysterious power{{color id="-1"}} down in
{{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm... {{delay8}}Since all that was true, then there's
something more I want to check on with
the {{color id="0"}}things collected{{color id="-1"}} from {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Wait here just a sec!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_03"}}Hmmm. Not that. Nope, not that either.


AHA! {{delay15}}Here we go!

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Here, Swordsman!

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This is a {{color id="0"}}schema stone for a
balloon{{color id="-1"}}, {{delay8}}right?

So if you used this with {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}}, you
could replicate a balloon. {{delay8}}Right?

I'm thinking...

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It looks like a {{color id="0"}}schema stone for a balloon{{color id="-1"}}.


I wonder if you could use that new
{{color id="0"}}Autobuild {{color id="-1"}}power for this...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Inspiration_00"}}Oh! I've got {{delay8}}an idea!

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_03"}}That balloon over there belongs to
Goggles, but it's broken right now.

Do you think you might be able to fix it
with {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Eep! So exciting! I want to see it in action
pronto. I'll go prepare really quick!

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_04"}}Swordsman! {{delay8}}Everything's ready!


Please demonstrate how {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}}
replicates things!

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Show me the {{color id="0"}}replication ability{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}},
that you found in the Depths. You can
use it to fix {{color id="0"}}Goggles's balloon{{color id="-1"}}!
I'm so excited!

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, Swordsman!


Where are you taking that? I want you to
show me here!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, Swordsman!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That's different from the {{color id="0"}}Autobuild
ability{{color id="-1"}}, right?

It's supposed to be the {{color id="0"}}ability to replicate
things{{color id="-1"}}—not assemble them piece by
piece, right?
So, please. Show me how {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}}
works and fix {{color id="0"}}Goggles's balloon{{color id="-1"}}!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}This must be the mysterious power

I never thought I'd see such a marvel with
my very own eyes.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_03"}}Thank you for making this a reality.
Please, take this. I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Um... Your pouch is full.

I want to go to {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} soon, but
let's make sure you get your reward
first, hm?

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I still haven't been able to figure out
what that is.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But judging from that light, it's gotta be
Zonai in origin!

Since you can use Zonai powers, I think it
would be better for you to have it.

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_03"}}There was an incredible power lying
hidden in the Depths after all...

I think I'll keep researching the Depths,
going forward.

Who knows? I just might find a clue about
Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If you make any new discoveries in the
Depths, please let me know, Swordsman!
