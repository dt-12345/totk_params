{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hey! {{delay8}}You're the guy I met at the
Yiga Clan hideout...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Are you looking for the three branches?{{delay8}}
Yeah, me too. Me too... {{delay15}}

Maybe you should just, y'know, quit? {{delay8}}Is
joining the Yiga Clan reeeally worth such
a dangerous, deadly entrance exam?

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Trying to scare him off didn't even slow him down.
I can't have him beating me to the punch...{{delay8}}

Let's hope he hasn't heard the rumors that the
what's-its-name lab to the northeast is now
Yiga Clan territory...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

I can't have him beating me to the punch! I've got
a good chance if he hasn't heard the rumors...
Like the one about a Yiga Clan branch somewhere
on a high, flat area southwest of the castle...said to
be where the kingdom was founded or something.
Heh, I'm sure not gonna tell him!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

in the Aldor Foothills to the west of the Great

But I'm not about to tell him that.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh... This guy doesn't seem like he's in any sort of
hurry. It's almost like he got the clan attire already.{{pageBreak}}What am I saying?{{delay8}} He couldn't have.{{delay8}} I mean...{{delay15}}
there's no way, {{size value="100"}}{{delay8}}{{size value="80"}}is there?{{size value="100"}}{{delay8}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Wh-wha— {{delay8}}A real live Yiga Clan member?!{{pageBreak}}Hm? {{delay15}}I know that blond hair.{{delay8}} You're the
guy I met at the Yiga Clan hideout, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}L-look, I love the Yiga Clan as much as
the next guy, but anybody'd be shocked
if you talked to them in that getup!
Wait a sec...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Then, {{delay8}}you collected the Yiga attire?{{delay8}}
A-all three pieces?!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}You're kidding me. {{delay8}}Seriously?{{delay15}} How did he get the
whole outfit before me?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}Hahaha, wow. I am...SO happy for you. It
even covers your face, so people will fall
in love with your handsome mystique.{{size value="80"}}
{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Ngh... Now that he's done it, I don't wanna copy
him. I've gotta find some other way to make

masked up like that!{{pageBreak}}Hold on...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You, uh...{{delay8}} You do know that's a Yiga Clan
mask...{{delay8}}right?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Wooow,{{delay8}} that's {{delay15}}so great...{{delay8}} Good for you!
Yeah. It really suits you. I guess.{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Darn it, he got his mask before I did... But it's not
like they only have one to give away.

I'll get that whole outfit for myself! {{delay8}}Then I'll learn all
the Yiga moves, and everyone will say, "Oh, Mimos,
you're the coolest, handsomest Yiga around!"{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hm... {{delay8}}No, you don't give off that classic
Yiga Clan bloodthirstiness...{{delay15}} You're the

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What gives? Are you just here to show off
your cool outfit?{{pageBreak}}Well, for your information, I'm not
interested in the Yiga Clan anymore.
I'm not even that jealous!
My mom always told me, "Mimos, you're
wonderful just the way you are," so there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Besides, shouldn't you be more worried
about yourself?{{pageBreak}}If you go around all dressed up like a
Yiga, nobody's gonna be swooning over
you. They'll be running scared!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You could give someone a couple-joining
{{color id="0"}}ring garland {{color id="-1"}}from Kakariko Village at the
famous {{color id="0"}}love spot{{color id="-1"}} in Faron and still...
nobody'd ever fall for you in that getup!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Sorry, buddy, but I'm not interested
in the Yiga Clan anymore. Trying to show
off is just wasting your time!
My mom always said, "Mimos, you're the
handsomest boy in the whole world," so
there's no need for me to dress up.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Just so you know, dressing up like a
member of the Yiga Clan won't make you
popular. Everyone will just run from you!
