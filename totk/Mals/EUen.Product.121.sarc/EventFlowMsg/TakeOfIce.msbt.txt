Th-the ice...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh. You're a Hylian...


Vasaaq. This is the {{color id="0"}}icehouse{{color id="-1"}}. It's where
we store ice...{{delay8}}obviously. It's all made from
snowmelt from the Gerudo Highlands.
I'm kind of surprised to see you here.
It isn't really a tourist destination.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But you're probably wondering where all
the ice is, right? Well, it's gotten hot
enough that it all melted.
Feels wrong to even call the place an
{{color id="0"}}icehouse{{color id="-1"}} right now...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Have you heard about the incredibly
popular drink the Noble Canteen in town
makes? Well, it uses ice from here.
Or it did. If I can't get ice delivered to
town, there won't be any signature drinks
being made by anyone.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I've got to find a way to make ice...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh, you again?{{delay8}} Like I said before, this is
the {{color id="0"}}icehouse{{color id="-1"}}. It's not really a place
tourists tend to check out though.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But if you're wondering where the ice
is, well... It's gotten hot enough that it
all melted down.
Feels wrong to even call the place an
{{color id="0"}}icehouse{{color id="-1"}} right now...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe you've heard about the super-
popular drink the Noble Canteen makes
in town? It uses ice from here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I haven't gotten any orders for ice lately,
no doubt due to this strange {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}
that won't seem to go away...
So if I don't have any ice to deliver when
the orders finally come, everyone back
home will be really disappointed...
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I simply cannot allow anything to come between
Gerudo Town and that wonderful, icy, popular drink
at the canteen.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

label: talk0003

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now that the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud {{color id="-1"}}has finally died
down, I expect the demand for ice to pick
right up again!
So if I can't deliver any ice because I
don't have any, everyone back home
will be really disappointed...
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I simply cannot allow anything to come between
Gerudo Town and that wonderful, icy, popular drink

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You know, on the really, really {{color id="0"}}cold{{color id="-1"}}
nights, I sometimes see a thin layer of ice
forming on the surface of the water.
It's always melted by the time morning
comes though. There must be some way
to get {{color id="0"}}ice {{color id="-1"}}in here...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey! That's ice, isn't it?


I didn't know Hylians could make ice!
Maybe I've been in the icehouse—or up
on the mountain—for too long...
Anyway, if it's OK with you, could I have
this ice?

---
label: talk0021

If it's possible to make a hunk of ice that
fits nicely in that alcove, that would
be ideal.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That's all a long way of me asking you...
Can I have this ice?

Just a bunch of water...

Ice...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The desert has been hotter than usual
and all my ice keeps melting. I'm getting
kind of steamed. Heh heh.
But you Hylians can make ice, right?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Any chance you can help me out with
some freezy goodness? I need ice!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, you've put some ice in the alcove
for me. Sarq!

However...{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I won't argue that there is now ice in
the alcove. That much is true.

But how much ice?{{delay15}} Not a lot, not a lot...{{delay15}}
This chunk of ice is just {{color id="0"}}too small{{color id="-1"}}. It'll
melt before it makes it to town.
Why don't you use the size of the alcove
to measure? If the ice is {{color id="0"}}around the same
width{{color id="-1"}} as the {{color id="0"}}alcove{{color id="-1"}}, that should do fine!

label: talk0018

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hm? What...{{delay15}}happened?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hey, wait! Ice!

---
label: talk0008

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, hey! Perfectly sized ice! This'll
definitely hold up on the trip to town.
That's great!

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarq!


Hopefully this is something you can make
use of! Be sure to grab something to drink
at the canteen in town!

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Feel free to come back and make more
ice, OK? 

Er, but I don't have anything I can give
you as a reward right now...

It wouldn't feel right to accept your help
when I can't repay you, so give me some
time, OK?
You could always visit the spa in Gerudo
Town in the mean—

Oh, wait.{{delay15}} You're a voe, so you aren't
allowed inside Gerudo Town. {{delay15}}Maybe you
could relax at Kara Kara Bazaar instead?
