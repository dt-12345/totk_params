{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That means good morning in Gerudo.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I wonder what greeting I should use

Let's play!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What d'ya want?


I'm going to play with {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} now,
so don't bug me, OK?

She's {{color id="0"}}moving{{color id="-1"}} reeeally soon, so we gotta
play a whole bunch while we can!

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}What d'ya want now?


{{color id="0"}}Mattison is moving{{color id="-1"}} really soon, so I've
gotta play with her. A lot. I mean it.

So, don't bother me!

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Ugh, come on. {{delay8}}Can't you see I'm playing
a game with {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}}?

She says it's special training for dealing
with something called a voe!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}I think these voe things are some kind of
monsters or something. I guess I better
watch out for 'em too!

label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Hey, I told you not to pester me!{{pageBreak}}I'm pretending to be one of those voe
monster things. If you interrupt, I can't
help {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} do her special training!

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I sure hope it stops raining soon.
I was playing this fun training game
with {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}}.
But we can't practice outsmarting voe
when it's like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}When is this rain ever gonna stop? I can't
wait to play that training game with

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Whaaat? I've gotta go home. I'm sooo
sleepy.

My friend {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} said she's going
to study now in {{color id="0"}}her room on the
second floor{{color id="-1"}}.
She's so amazing. There's no way I could
do that.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} said Gerudo don't need very
much sleep.

I guess that's why she{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}can stay up
so late.

But even if I could stay up late, there's
no way I could study as much as
{{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} does.

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wonder if {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} is still studying in
{{color id="0"}}her room{{color id="-1"}}?

She's pretty amazing, huh? I'm way too
sleepy for that.

I'm supposed to play with {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}}, so
don't bother me, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But she hasn't come down from her {{color id="0"}}room
on the second floor{{color id="-1"}}. Maybe she's busy
studying Gerudo?
It's sooo confusing how many "vo"
and "va" sounds there are in all those
Gerudo words.

my friend for always.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But she had to move to this place called
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}southwest{{color id="-1"}} because of
something called a tradition.
I heard it's really far away and really
hot...but also really cold!
