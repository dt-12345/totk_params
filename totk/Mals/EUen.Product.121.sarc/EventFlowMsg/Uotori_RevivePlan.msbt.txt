{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you...{{delay15}}for everything.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}We're gonna start by rebuilding the

label: Talk_0144

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK, so as far as {{color id="0"}}logs {{color id="-1"}}go, I need {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Uotori_RevivePlan_GetWoodCount_Remained" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} more.
Think you can handle that?

And when I say "logs," I don't mean the
kind that come from palm trees.{{pageBreak}}I've got plans for those palm trees, OK?
So make sure our {{color id="0"}}logs {{color id="-1"}}come from other
kinds of trees.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We've already gathered all the logs we

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You can get yourself some logs by cutting
down trees.

But watch out. Get carried away and cut
the logs...well, then you've got nothing
but wood, and that's no good.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}I saw lots of gorgeous trees growing
around the hills near the village entrance.

Remember? Near the place we were
hiding out?

I admit, it's a bit of a hike. Sure would be

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}No, no. There's no need to thank me.
After all, when I first drifted into this
village...
you all welcomed me with open arms,
didn't you?

The work I did here, it's just my way of
paying that kindness back.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This village owes you a debt... In fact,
I think it's safe to say that you are this

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Now, I talked about this with the rest of
the folks around here...

treasure to repay you for saving our
home.

So from now on, we'll do everything we
can to share our hospitality with you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}The village's savior may not need to test
his luck, but I'm sure it'd be fun to {{color id="0"}}play
