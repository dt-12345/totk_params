{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hey, I remember you. {{delay8}}You're the reason
we're not still on the ground, groaning
and clutching our bellies.
I'll admit it—throwing {{color id="0"}}Moblin guts {{color id="-1"}}into our
food was not one of my best ideas.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Instead, I should have used {{color id="0"}}monster
extract{{color id="-1"}}. That would've been delicious!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Maybe next time I'll try monster extract,
Hylian rice, and rock salt? Yeah, that
ought to work nicely...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't tell the others, but I've been staying

Moblin guts in the food, it didn't turn

going to try adding monster parts again,
OK? I learned my lesson.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}And if a drop or two of {{color id="0"}}monster extract{{color id="-1"}}

Monster extract?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Monster parts are used in {{color id="0"}}elixirs {{color id="-1"}}and, as
I learned the hard way, will spoil any food
you put them in.
{{color id="0"}}Monster extract{{color id="-1"}}, on the other hand,
can be added to most any dish, with
delicious results.
If you want to buy the stuff, you can
find it in {{color id="0"}}a village in the Akkala region{{color id="-1"}}
northeast of here.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm running out myself, so I should go
buy some too.{{pageBreak}}It is pretty far away though.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You mean you haven't seen that poster

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This looks like a tasty recipe. {{delay15}}Now, what
are the ingredients? Bright-eyed crab and
Goron spice?
I should be able to catch bright-eyed
crab in a river.{{pageBreak}}For Goron spice, though, I'd have to go
to {{color id="0"}}the general store in Goron City{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Well, now that Death Mountain stopped
erupting, Hylians can go there without

Maybe I'll stock up when we go northeast.
