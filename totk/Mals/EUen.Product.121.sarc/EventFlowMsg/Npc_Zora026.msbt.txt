{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}So much sludge...{{delay8}}


I don't know if I can take it anymore.

---
label: talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Cry_00"}}The sludge... {{delay15}}How frightening.

---
label: near00
---
The sludge is gone!

---
label: talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Wow... How amazing!


The sludge that was on the statue is
gone!{{delay15}} There was so much there, it seems
nearly impossible!

---
label: talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Tee-hee! {{delay8}}I'm so relieved that the statue is
clean now!{{delay8}} Thank you so much!

---
label: talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}So! A Hylian was able to make it to the
domain. That's encouraging.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}But then...you are very special, Link.{{delay15}}
Sasan is not, um...special in that
same way.

---
label: talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I could ask, "Sasan, are you doing well?"
Oh, but what if he isn't?

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}How about, "Sasan, are you alive?"{{delay8}}
Ah, but that's very rude if he isn't.

---
label: talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm writing a letter to someone important
to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}It's for Sasan. {{delay15}}He's a Hylian who is very
dear to me.

---
label: 0000
---
Sasan?

---
label: 0002
---
Someone important?

---
label: 0001
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Yes, Sasan! Why are you bringing him up?
Do you have news?!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh... {{delay8}}I guess it's because I mentioned
him, huh? 

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Sasan is my best friend and favorite
person.{{delay8}} He's Hylian and a traveling
merchant. Pretty neat, right?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We made a promise that, no matter what
transpired, we would always meet up here
in Zora's Domain on a certain day.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Sasan always keeps his promises.
However, this time...

That day has already come and gone,
and still no sight of him.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}{{size value="80"}}He still hasn't arrived...{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}That's why I decided to write him a letter.
{{delay8}}After all, I must do something!

---
label: talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That's right.{{delay8}} Sasan is important to me.{{delay8}}
He's my best friend and favorite person!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I was kind of a loner before I met him.{{delay8}}
My family and friends stay pretty busy.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}That's why I sent a letter drifting down
the river.{{delay8}} I wanted to connect with
someone.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}The rest, as they say, is history. {{delay8}}I got a 
response, {{delay8}}and it was from Sasan!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ever since, he's always kept the promise
we made to meet up in the domain on a
certain day, no matter what transpired.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}However, this time is different. The
promised day has come and gone, and
Sasan never appeared.
I'm so worried.{{delay8}} I want to go and search
for him, but...{{delay8}}with the sludge, I know it
would worry my mother sick if I left.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}She asked me to try writing a letter
instead. I hate that it's so reasonable,
I had to comply.

label: talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Urgh... I'm having so much trouble
writing this.

label: near02

Sasan...

---
label: talk25
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I'm so worried about you, Sasan...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}{{size value="125"}}Hey! {{delay8}}What in the world?!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I thought that I could escape my restless
thoughts by walking.

Before I knew it, I was going around
in circles.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! {{delay8}}This spot...


{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}This is where Sasan and I would come to
talk for hours.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Cry_00"}}Urgh... {{delay15}}*sniffle*{{delay8}} I'm so worried about
you, Sasan...

---
label: talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'm so worried about Sasan, I can hardly
stand still!

---
label: 0003
---
Sasan?

---
label: 0004
---
I'll leave you alone.

---
label: talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Yes, Sasan.{{delay15}} He's my best friend and
favorite person. {{delay15}}He's also a Hylian,
like you.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}However... {{delay15}}Since the sludge showed up,
he hasn't been showing up in the domain
on the day he promised he always would.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Nothing like this has ever happened
before, so I'm quite worried.

It's too dangerous to leave because
everything is covered in sludge.{{delay15}} Urgh...{{delay8}}
I guess I'll have to wait here a bit longer.

---
label: talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Whatever could have happened to him...

---
label: talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Finley... Our adventure at Tarm Point was
unforgettable, wasn't it?

I have some other great stories from the
trip as well.{{delay15}} Would you like to hear them?

---
label: talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Yes, of course! {{delay8}}I love listening to your
stories, Sasan.

---
label: near03
---
I love chatting with Sasan!

---
label: near04
---
I can't wait...

---
label: talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Hee-hee! {{delay8}}I'm off to finally meet up
with Sasan.

I'm sure we'll speak at length to make up
for the time we lost {{delay8}}because of that
horrible sludge.

---
label: talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Hee-hee!{{delay8}} I'm waiting for Sasan.


We promised that we would meet up here.

---
label: near07
---
Tell me more!

---
label: talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sasan, how wonderful it would be{{delay8}} if you
could stay here in the domain forever.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Then again, if you did that, I wouldn't be
able to hear your stories about your
adventures and the other places you visit.

---
label: talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Haha, {{delay8}}that's true.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It would be amazing if we could go on an
adventure together one day, Finley!

---
label: talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I found a lake under this dizzyingly high
cliff in Rito Village, {{delay8}}and so I tried closing
my eyes and jumping in.

---
label: talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I tried my best to withstand the heat in
the Goron Hot Springs,{{delay8}} until it got so hot,
I could practically boil an egg in there!

---
label: talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}There was an incredible sand shroud
blowing around in Gerudo Town.{{delay8}}
It really roughed me up!

---
label: talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I walked through the sludge and climbed
over stones...{{delay8}}{{delay8}} I did whatever I had to so
that I could make it to Zora's Domain.
After all, I promised you that I would swim
and climb and lift and do all sorts of
things to try to build up my muscles.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I couldn't swim the rivers though...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Sasan, that's amazing!{{delay8}} Please, tell me all
about your adventures!

---
label: talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}Time sure flies when you're enjoying
great conversation. Before I knew it,
the sun had set.
Good night!
