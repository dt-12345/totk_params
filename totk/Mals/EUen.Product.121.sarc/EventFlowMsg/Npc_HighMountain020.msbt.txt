{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}Look at this thing. What is the world
coming to when something like this can
just fall from the sky?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}On top of which, the blizzard shows no
sign of abating. So be careful when you
travel these mountains.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}No one is safe walking around—let alone
flying—when these things can just fall
from the sky.{{pageBreak}}And if that wasn't bad enough, the snow
has been abnormally heavy. Be very
careful as you go around these parts.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Unbelievable that these huge things are

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Oh, oops. I hadn't expected to meet
a Hylian here. What are you doing in the
mountains in this weather?{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Don't you see how cold it's gotten? Our
feathers keep out the worst of it, but I'm
not sure how you can stand the blizzard.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you go farther up this slope, you'll see

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I was so worried about having to leave the
kids behind during the blizzard.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But after it was over and I returned,
I discovered the most amazing thing.{{delay8}}
Kotts had been making the beds.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Kotts! The girl who'd use any excuse to
get out of chores! She was helping out
all on her own.{{pageBreak}}Leaving the place entirely up to them
turned out to be a great idea. {{delay8}}I suppose
that's how kids grow up.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}We don't use words like "silky soft"

else to describe how nice it feels.
