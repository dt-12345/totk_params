A prophecy...

label: Talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Look at you, partner! Up at sunup
scouting out leads. You remind me of me.

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Look at you, partner! Coming all
the way out here to track down leads.
You remind me of me.

---
label: Talk61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Look at you, partner! Feeling around
for leads after dark. You remind me of me.

---
label: Talk68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! Look at you, partner! Digging around
in the rain, hoping to turn up a lead. You
remind me of me.

---
label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, how about it? Tell me you've got
something we can work with. {{delay8}}No?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I've got nothing either. Not a chirp. Not
a warble.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Even if I strain the ol' earholes... No, sir.
Not the slightest peep.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So, what to do when our leads go quiet
and luck runs out? I suppose we've got
one last resort. A {{color id="0"}}prophecy{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 0010
---
A prophecy?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, yes. {{delay15}}It's come to that. Good thing
there's one heck of a {{color id="0"}}Cucco{{color id="-1"}} around here.
That, er...{{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}speaks prophecy{{color id="-1"}}.
I mean we know it's hard to believe, but
you've got to wonder.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look at the tree there—the one way up
on that hill.

They say folks are lining up to hear those
prophecies every day, hoping to have
their fortunes told.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I know what you're thinking—seasoned
reporter like me, hoping to get a lead from
actual poultry?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, hear me out. Those that flock up
there for their fortunes? They might know
the REAL story here. Interview them!

---
label: Near01
---
Hm. A clairvoyant Cucco?

---
label: Talk54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}How's it going, partner? You pick up
any leads out there? {{delay8}}Because at the
moment, I've got diddly and squat.

---
label: Talk65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Not one chirp or warble about our missing
princess, I'm sorry to say.

---
label: Talk55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If we've got nothing else, we may have to
make a trip to the {{color id="0"}}All-Clucking Cucco {{color id="-1"}}at
the tree on the hill.

---
label: Talk64
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I know... {{delay8}}A Cucco spouting {{color id="0"}}prophecies{{color id="-1"}}?
Total fluff—it's not why reporters like you
and me got into this game.
Sometimes you have to swallow your pride
and take the byline. And who knows?
Maybe there's a real story buried here.

impressed, but I already knew that was
going to happen. {{delay8}}So...
Thou, yes, thou! Ready to face the next
trial? Only if thou overcome it...will thou
find what thou seeketh!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}So...{{delay15}}are you going to try it or what?

You've GOT to be worn out.

Well, it's been entertaining. So naive.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was just giving a good, long think to the
All-Clucking Cucco situation...{{delay8}}when I saw
everyone running around the tree here.
So, what's the story, kid?

---
label: Talk41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Uh-huh...{{delay15}} I see...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Well, I had a suspicion that a Cucco
couldn't yap to save its life, but I didn't
suspect this was a {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}} trap.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Those chumps really knew how to lure us
in by mentioning Princess Zelda. Guess
we walked right into that one.

---
label: Talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But at least this'll make one heck of a
newspaper story.{{delay8}} All those who put their
faith in that Cucco's prophecies...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}People need to know the truth—or else
they'll fall for more of these lies in the
future. Oracles, my tail feathers!

---
label: Talk71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Anyway, get a load of you! Giving us a
big scoop and those Yiga dolts a healthy
clobbering, all in the same day.
Not bad for a day's work! You keep that
up and I'll have no choice but to keep you
on as my partner for a long, long time.
But enough crowing. If I want to meet my
deadline, I'd better get back to the office
and start writing this up.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}See you, kid!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you here for a prophecy from the
All-Clucking Cucco?

Get ready for your life to change. They
say the Cucco's words always come true!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Actually, do you want to take my place
in line? I have a lot of questions, and I
need time to sort out which to ask...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Really, you'd be doing me a favor.
Go ahead!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I have so many questions to ask... I need

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there, fella. So, checking out my

I'm a little late to fashion and all that,
but my eyes are wide open now.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was heading east for {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}},
since I'd heard celebrity designer Cece

But when I heard about the oracle here,
I had to stop by and see for myself if
it's the real deal.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And buddy, it's real as can be! Here's the
prophecy I got:{{delay8}} "On a remote island to the
{{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}, thou wilt find great fortune."
Tarrey Town will have to wait. I have an
island to go to! I just hope "great fortune"
means a treasure trove of clothes...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there, fella. So, checking out my

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was heading east for {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}},
since I'd heard celebrity designer Cece
was influenced by someone there.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But the All-Clucking Cucco just reminded
me again that "on a remote island to the
{{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}, thou will find great fortune."
So clearly, I've gotta go northeast!
Who knows, right? Maybe I'll find a big
pile of stylish and expensive clothes!

---
label: Talk67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The All-Clucking Cucco said that "great
fortune" is waiting for me on a "remote
island to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}."
As for what that "fortune" looks like,
I can't say... {{delay8}}But it could be clothes!
Or money I can use to buy clothes!
So before I go east to Tarrey Town, I have
to go see it! Who knows? Maybe this'll be
my big break in the world of fashion!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The All-Clucking Cucco is next to the big

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}No, it can't be!{{delay8}} The All-Clucking Cucco
was a hoax?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But then, the prophecies... That means
they were all made up.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. What am I gonna do now? I guess
I shouldn't bother checking out that
"remote island to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}"...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then again, who knows... There might be
some truth in it, right?

---
label: Talk75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Sounds like the All-Clucking Cucco was
a scam, and the prophecy I got was a
load of bunk.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then again... There could be truth in it.
Maybe a higher power is nudging me to
