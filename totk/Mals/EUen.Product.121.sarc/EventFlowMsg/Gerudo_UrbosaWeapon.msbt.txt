I'm feeling restless.

Oh, vasaaq...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Everyone, including me, has been able to
get back to our normal lives.

And it's all because of you! {{delay8}}Sarqso!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know...{{delay15}}we all owe you a great debt,
and I think I can begin to repay it by
crafting the {{color id="0"}}arms of the Seven{{color id="-1"}} for you.
They are a sword and shield passed down
by the Gerudo, and they can only be
wielded by a chosen individual.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}I'm talking about the {{color id="0"}}Scimitar of the
Seven {{color id="-1"}}and the {{color id="0"}}Daybreaker{{color id="-1"}}, of course.

They're crafted using a special technique
known only to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And I...{{delay8}}have chosen you to carry them.
Will you let me make the {{color id="0"}}arms of the
Seven{{color id="-1"}} for you?

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you hadn't shown up when you did,
I wouldn't be here right now.

With me gone, the long line of those
who are capable of crafting the {{color id="0"}}arms of
the Seven{{color id="-1"}} would have ended too.
The arms of the Seven... A legendary
sword and shield passed down among the
Gerudo, wielded by a chosen individual.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm talking about a shield called the
{{color id="0"}}Daybreaker{{color id="-1"}} and a sword known as the
{{color id="0"}}Scimitar of the Seven{{color id="-1"}}.
And...after what you did to help me,
I have chosen you to carry the {{color id="0"}}arms of
the Seven{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Now, would you allow me to make them
for you?

---
label: 0005
---
Yes, please.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's the spirit!


OK then, I just need you to gather some
materials for me. Can you do that?

Truth be told, I'd like to gather the
materials for you myself, but it is the duty
of the bearer of the arms to do that.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I need four diamonds, 10 pieces of flint...
a Gerudo scimitar, and a Gerudo shield.

Even a decayed Gerudo scimitar will do
the trick!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK then...{{delay8}}once you've gathered all of
those materials together, come and talk
to me, OK?

---
label: 0006
---
Maybe later...

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Not a problem. It's entirely up to you if
you want me to make these weapons.
Let me know if you change your mind.

---
label: near0001
---
You came...

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm always shocked when I speak with
the others about you. It's a real sa'oten—
a surprise—how incredible you are.
Sarqso for not only helping Gerudo Town
but also for helping me.

If not for you, my people may have forever
lost the knowledge of how to make the
{{color id="0"}}arms of the Seven{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They are a legendary sword and shield
passed down among the Gerudo, wielded
by a chosen individual.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm talking about a shield called the
{{color id="0"}}Daybreaker{{color id="-1"}} and a sword known as the
{{color id="0"}}Scimitar of the Seven{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I have chosen you to carry the {{color id="0"}}arms of
the Seven{{color id="-1"}}.

Would you allow me to make these
legendary items for you?

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You're not just my savior—you're the
savior of all of the Gerudo.

It would be an honor to make the {{color id="0"}}arms
of the Seven{{color id="-1"}} for you.

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Do you need anything else?

---

---
Let's get to crafting!

---
label: 0003
---
About the materials...

---
label: 0004
---
Felt like saying hello!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I need four diamonds, 10 pieces of flint...
a Gerudo scimitar, and a Gerudo shield.

Even a decayed Gerudo scimitar will do
the trick!

Truth be told, it's a bit of a pain to gather
the materials, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I know you can do it.{{delay8}} You're the voe
I chose, after all.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh my...{{delay8}} What a nice thing to say!


Well, I'm happy to see you too!
You're vasaaq anytime.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}OK then, let me just make sure you have
everything I'll need...

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh my... It looks like you don't have all
the materials I need to get to work.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I need four diamonds, 10 pieces of flint...
a Gerudo scimitar, and a Gerudo shield.

Even a decayed Gerudo scimitar will do
the trick!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Truth be told, I'd like to gather the
materials for you, but it is the duty of
the bearer of the arms to do that.
I'm sure it's a bit of a pain to do it, but...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I know you can do it.{{delay8}} You're the voe
I chose, after all.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Four diamonds, 10 pieces of flint...
a Gerudo scimitar, and a Gerudo shield.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hee-hee! I knew you could do it. This is
everything I need to get to work!{{delay15}}

Give me just a minute...

---
label: talk0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Oh. {{delay8}}Hmm.{{delay8}} Well, you've brought me
enough materials, but...

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I don't think I can use the shield when it's
in this state...

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I don't think I can use the scimitar when
it's in this state...

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I don't think I can use the shield or the
scimitar when they are in this state...

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's very important that the materials not
have any extra things attached to them.

I'm not trying to be difficult—this is just
the reality of the situation.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Oh, and if you're worried about losing
whatever is attached...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You should head to {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} in
northeast Hyrule.

I hear there's an expert there who has
specialized in removing attachments
and adornments.
They may be able to help you out.

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I poured all of my heart into making these.{{delay8}}


Here, take them. They are a true symbol
of the gratitude of the Gerudo.

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I wish you good fortune in your travels...

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You're the second person I've made those
for.{{delay15}} Lady Riju was the first.

My ancestor even made them for the
Champion of the Gerudo some time ago.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That really just goes to show how amazing
they are. It'll make me happy if you take
good care of them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}But I did make them to be used, so don't
feel like you need to preserve them...{{delay15}}

Should they ever be irretrievably lost,
just bring me the materials again and
I'll remake them for you.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And...also...


You can come and see me whenever you
like, even if you don't need anything.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}May the blessings of the Gerudo be
upon you...
