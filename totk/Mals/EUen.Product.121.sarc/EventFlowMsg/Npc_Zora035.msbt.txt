{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Ah, Link! It is good to see you. I am,
after all, indebted to you for your
repair of the stone slate.
Thanks to your efforts, the sludge has
disappeared, meaning that I can resume
my research. Needless to say...
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I cannot possibly thank you enough!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ahem...{{delay15}} Speaking of thanks, Queen Yona
mentioned that she would like to gift you
a token of gratitude.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It is no business of mine,{{delay8}} but I do
encourage you to hear what she
has to say.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link! It is good to see you. I am, after
all, indebted to you for your repair of the
stone slate.
Thanks to your efforts, the sludge has
disappeared, meaning that I can resume
my research. Needless to say...
I cannot possibly thank you enough!{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ahem. Speaking of thanks, Queen Yona
has been searching for the {{color id="0"}}Zora greaves{{color id="-1"}}.
She means to gift them to you.
I recall an old text mentioning that they
were dedicated at the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora
Waterworks{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}However,{{delay15}} Queen Yona has searched the
waterworks and turned up nothing. The
greaves are nowhere to be found.
Despite that, I still feel as if they must be
somewhere within the waterworks...

Perhaps they are in a less obvious place.
Or maybe...there is a chamber in the
waterworks we are unaware of?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I have already shared this with Queen
Yona, but I will let you in on it as well.

That ancient text mentioned that the
{{color id="0"}}Zora greaves{{color id="-1"}} were dedicated at the
{{color id="0"}}Ancient Zora Waterworks{{color id="-1"}}.
Since Queen Yona searched the
waterworks and yet did not find the
greaves, then I do wonder.
{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Specifically, I wonder whether or not there
might be some hidden chamber within the
waterworks that we have not known of.

You have a gift, Link! With your help,
research that would normally take a

Thanks to your efforts, the sludge has

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All of the stone monuments across the
various Zora regions, including this one,
were made anew.
They were all thoughtfully written by our
beloved Prince Sidon... Oh! I meant to
say our beloved KING Sidon.
If you ever see one during your travels,
I encourage you to read it.
