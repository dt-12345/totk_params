{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What's this you've got?


{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Huh? {{delay8}}Could it...{{delay8}} Could it really be...

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Paya! Calip!


Look at this!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_01
---
...

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Could this be...{{delay8}}the interior of the floating
Ring Ruin?!{{delay15}}

Wow! {{delay8}}The stone slab is so clearly visible!

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}There appear to be Zonai inscriptions
on this one as well, just like in the other
Ring Ruins. Tauro, if you would?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Right! Let me see what I can decipher.{{delay8}}


Hmm...

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}"...promise...Zelda...{{delay15}}solemnly signed...{{delay15}}
Mineru, Sage of...

"...hide the key...{{delay15}}southeast... Entrust...
future...wish...{{delay15}}defeat...Demon King..."

That's all I can make out.


There's some lettering I can't figure out
before "southeast," but "{{color id="0"}}Mineru{{color id="-1"}}" seems
to be someone's name.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hmm. Look at the context of "Mineru."{{delay8}}
I do believe this is the first time one of
these slabs has put a name to a sage!{{pageBreak}}It also mentions "Zelda" and a "Demon
King."{{delay8}} How fascinating!

---
label: Talk_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Aha! {{delay8}}The inscriptions are telling us all
sorts of essential information!

---
label: Talk_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}...

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What's the matter?

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Oh, nothing. It's just...{{delay8}} That part before
the "southeast" section...

I think it says...{{delay8}}"dragon land."

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm?


{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah! You're right!


Paya knows her stuff. This should be read
as "{{color id="0"}}dragon land{{color id="-1"}}...{{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}."

Fantastic work, Paya!

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, thank goodness I've proven useful!
It seems my continued Zonai-language
studies have paid off.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh no...I'm being upstaged!{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{size value="125"}}Ahem.{{size value="100"}}


Where were we?{{delay15}} Something about a
dragon land to the southeast?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hmm.{{delay15}} How familiar are you with southeast
Hyrule? There's a site in Faron that has
long been known as the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
It predates the ruins falling from the sky,
and is home to many ancient relics.

If memory serves, there were dragon
designs on those ruins that I haven't
seen anywhere else.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Oho, Calip! Great catch!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{size value="125"}}The {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins in Faron{{color id="-1"}}!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}There's a good chance that's exactly
what this is pointing us at.

---
label: Talk_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That's our Calip! Fantastic work!

---
label: Talk_68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}I...{{delay15}} I...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}What did you just say?

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}That...this inscription is pointing us
toward Faron's {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}No, not that. The next bit.


A certain adjective was used? {{delay8}}I believe
it started with "fan" and ended with
"tastic"? What was it again?

---
label: Talk_75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Ah. "Fantastic work," you mean?

---
label: Talk_71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Hee-hee, yes! Fantastic work! {{delay15}}That is
what you said!

Hm. Yes.

---
label: Talk_78
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}"Calip, what fantastic work!" he said.{{size value="100"}}


{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Fantastic... Me!{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_69

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Link, when we put together the script on
this stone slab and translate it...

We get definite mentions of the Sage
Mineru, the Demon King, and someone
with the same name as Princess Zelda.
Something related to all three of them
must be waiting at the Zonai Ruins in
southeast Hyrule!
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}We've landed a real catch here!{{size value="100"}}


Thank you for your help. Truly.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now, we've no time to dawdle. There's
research to be done!

---
label: Talk_72
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Calip! Will you join me?

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Of course! I would be a...*ahem*...
fantastic addition to the team.

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Very good! With that settled, let's be off
to the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}} in{{color id="0"}} Faron{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}First we head {{color id="0"}}southwest{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_57
---
We'll establish a base in the{{color id="0"}} Popla
Foothills{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}at the{{color id="0"}} Skyview Tower by
the ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In search of new discoveries...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}{{size value="125"}}WE MAKE FOR FARON!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}They left, just like that.{{delay15}} Well, I'm sure
those two will be fine.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I must study more about the Zonai
civilization so I don't fall behind
Tauro and Calip.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'll also continue pursuing our research
of the Ring Ruins...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}And as the village chief, making this an
exciting place of course.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}We have you to thank for all that we
accomplished here, Master Link. From
the bottom of my heart, thank you.

label: Talk_26

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I must study more about the Zonai
civilization so I don't fall behind
Tauro and Calip.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Yet it seems somewhat frivolous next to
the mystery of the real Princess Zelda's
whereabouts.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I don't doubt that she is safe and well.
I must believe that.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}As chief of this village, I can't leave
my people, so I must place the search
in your capable hands.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I pray that Princess Zelda will return to
us soon.
