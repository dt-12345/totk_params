{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}I really thought we'd found it too...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Who knows how long it would take to
open all of those one by one.

My arms are tired just thinking about it!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}And every single chest we open, we find

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}You again! {{delay8}}You're the guy from before.{{delay8}}
Don't you have anything better to do than
eavesdrop on us?!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}What's your deal?! {{delay15}}Wait, don't tell me...{{delay8}}
You came to this cave to find {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}} too!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}P-Prissen!{{delay15}} Don't just say that! {{delay15}}Shhh!

label: Comment_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ack. {{delay8}}I mentioned {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}},
didn't I?{{delay15}} Sorry, Dak...

Misko's treasure?

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Don't get any bright ideas! If you're
planning on swooping in and snagging
it, think again!

---
label: Comment_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Don't worry, Dak! With all those treasure
chests in there, there's no way he'll ever
find {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}.
We've got nothing to worry about!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm... {{delay15}}You've got a point.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Yeah... Yeah, OK. {{delay8}}Listen up, you!{{delay15}} You've
got our permission to go into that cave!

---
label: Comment_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If seasoned treasure hunters like us
couldn't find it, you're not about to fare
any better.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Not unless you've got {{color id="0"}}a nose like a dog's{{color id="-1"}}
and can sniff out the treasure!

label: Comment_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}What? {{delay8}}Hey!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Whatever you thought you heard us say,
you didn't! Got that?!

---
label: Comment_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Tsk... {{delay8}}Whatever. No sense in trying to
hide it now.

{{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s the name of an infamous bandit
who caused problems all over Hyrule back
in the day.
But Misko's legend expands beyond mere
banditry. You see, Misko is equally famous
for fashion.
The stories say that they spent a lifetime
{{color id="0"}}collecting clothes{{color id="-1"}}—clothes that are now
hidden across Hyrule.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}We suspect that Misko's wardrobe might
be in the caves that were exposed during
the Upheaval.
That's why we're here.


{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}And we got here first, {{delay8}}so if you're thinking
of swooping in and snatching those duds,
think again!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Aw, there's no way he'll be able to find
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} in that sea of chests.{{pageBreak}}There's nothing to worry about, Dak!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}What is it? {{delay8}}You need something?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}You... {{delay8}}Don't tell me...{{delay15}}


Are you after the {{color id="0"}}treasure{{color id="-1"}} in that cave?!


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Urk—

---
label: Comment_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Seriously, Prissen? {{delay8}}You're just gonna
blurt that out?!

The fact that {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} rests in
that cave was supposed to be our
brotherly secret!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I— I'm sorry, Dak!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey, you eavesdropping over there! You
think you can find it? Then you'd better
think twice!
We're having trouble, and we're pros!

---
label: Comment_41

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If only one of us had a {{color id="0"}}nose like a dog{{color id="-1"}}.
Then we could sniff out the treasure.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That's it, Dak! {{delay8}}Let's give a dog some {{color id="0"}}food{{color id="-1"}}
or something to {{color id="0"}}get it to like us{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}and then
it'll lead us to the treasure!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Stop that!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}We never said you could take the chests
out of the cave!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Whoa, hey! {{delay8}}What'd you do?!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}No way!{{delay8}} There are, like, a million chests in
here! How did you do that?!

OK, yeah. We tailed you, I admit, but we
never thought you'd actually find it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We've been hunting treasure long enough
to know the rules—finders keepers. {{delay8}}We're
not going to try to take it from you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Yeah, no matter HOW cool it is. {{delay8}}So
jealous...{{delay8}} Any treasure left in there?

Outta the way!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I don't think we'll find anything else
