{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The rafts for crossing to the other
side are broken. {{delay8}}Transportation is
on hold indefinitely.{{pageBreak}}This is ordinarily where we send
resources across the river.{{pageBreak}}The only silver lining {{delay8}}is that the {{color id="0"}}Zonai
devices{{color id="-1"}} are undamaged.

Zonai devices?

That's a problem.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What are we to do?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Ah.{{delay8}} It seems you do not know of
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}They are necessities around here.{{delay8}}
Allow me to explain.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This green thing is called a {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The one you see here is a {{color id="0"}}fan{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} You can
produce wind on demand by striking it.{{pageBreak}}They are self-evidently useful. We have a
variety of {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices {{color id="-1"}}for multitudinous
purposes.

label: talk_52

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Using {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} does{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}require energy.{{pageBreak}}An external {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell {{color id="-1"}}will be necessary
in your case.

label: talk_57

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}{{delay8}}Oh? {{delay8}}You seem to lack an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The lack of an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell {{color id="-1"}}will prevent you
from using {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Yet {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} are necessities in this
region. {{delay8}}I have a solution. You should take
my spare.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}An {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} stores the energy required
to use {{color id="0"}}{{delay8}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Its energy will replenish automatically
while {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} are not in use.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Its capacity is not unlimited. {{delay8}}Use the
energy contained within wisely. {{delay8}}Otherwise
you may run out at inopportune moments.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ah. {{delay8}}You have one already. {{delay8}}That is a relief.{{pageBreak}}But perhaps a refresher explanation is
in order.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}{{delay8}}Pardon the long explanation. {{delay8}}It does not
change our need for a raft.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} are extremely useful. {{delay8}}Think
creatively and you will find many ways to
employ them.

label: talk_61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We have the {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}But I do not
see how it will help us with the broken-
raft situation.

label: talk_63

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The rafts seem to be beyond repair. {{delay8}}The
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} cannot help us mend them.

Zonai device?

That's a problem.

label: talk_54

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes. {{delay8}}This green thing is a {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}fan {{color id="-1"}}here activates when struck and
can produce wind whenever you want.

label: talk_66

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You may have need of them. The {{color id="0"}}Zonai
devices {{color id="-1"}}by the water are available for
your use.

---
label: talk_72

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}One note of caution. Your {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} will
deplete while using a {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Rest assured that it will recharge on its
own in time.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We remain at a standstill.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I am resting until the time bell rings.{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} by the water are still

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}We are out of options for now. {{delay8}}It is time
for us to rest.

label: talk_55

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Aaah! {{delay8}}We may have need of these parts.{{delay8}}
There are more materials near the water
available for your use.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}{{size value="80"}}It is very difficult to rest peacefully when things
