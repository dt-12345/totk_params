{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I have been tasked by{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}Mineru{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}with
gathering materials from the Depths.
This was meant to aid in her research.
My progress was interrupted when the
servant of the Demon King occupied the
Spirit Temple.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Your efforts have allowed me to return to
my duty. {{delay8}}I offer you my deepest thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I previously informed you that Mineru
tasked me with excavating materials
in this vicinity.
One such material was {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}}. I would
ask you to offer me all that you can spare.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Payment would of course be provided
in return.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can offer you one ancient blade for
every {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Zonau_GeniusWeapon_Requires" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} pieces of{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}} you supply.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}You already have a sufficient amount
of zonaite.{{pageBreak}}Will you trade it for an ancient blade?

this in return.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Very well. I would be pleased to
trade anytime.

label: Talk004

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh. {{delay8}}It appears that you are unable to
carry any more ancient blades.

Talk to me again when you are not at full
capacity. I would be pleased to trade at
any time.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You do not have sufficient materials
to trade.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I require {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Zonau_GeniusWeapon_Requires" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} pieces of zonaite{{color id="-1"}}. I would be
pleased to trade whenever you have an
adequate quantity.

label: Talk010

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I am sorry to report that you do not have
enough materials to trade.

I require {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Zonau_GeniusWeapon_Requires" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} pieces of zonaite{{color id="-1"}}. That is the
nonarbitrary quantity needed to proceed
with the research at hand.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}My apologies for prioritizing my task in an
uncompassionate way.{{delay8}} I look forward to
trading when you have adequate zonaite.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh? {{delay8}}It appears you still have enough
materials to continue trading.{{delay8}}

Would you like to trade for another
ancient blade?
