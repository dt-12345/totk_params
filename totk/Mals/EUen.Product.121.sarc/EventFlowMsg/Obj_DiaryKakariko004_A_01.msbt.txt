My beloved husband always gives it his
all when working in service of others.
I admire that about him.
He's been working himself to the bone
ever since being granted the honor of
guarding Lady Impa.
I wish for him to always be in good health
and good spirits.

That's why I made him a {{color id="0"}}tough
meat-stuffed pumpkin {{color id="-1"}}using
fortified pumpkin and fresh meat.
I was thrilled that he kept saying it was
tasty and going back for more! I hope it
filled his heart as well as his stomach.

My little Cottla. My perfect girl. I love her
so very much. She truly is the apple of
my eye!
Speaking of apples, she seems to have
quite the taste for {{color id="0"}}hot buttered apple{{color id="-1"}}.

She's like an adorable little squirrel,
always stuffing her cheeks full of them!

If I could, I would cook endless amounts
of {{color id="0"}}apples{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}goat butter{{color id="-1"}} to keep my
little one happy.

Koko is my precious treasure. As a sibling,
she's an absolute sweetheart. She cares
so deeply for her little sister.
Ever since Cottla was born, Koko doesn't
ever whine or complain anymore. She is
so strong and so wonderful.
Luckily, Mommy knows that Koko loves
{{color id="0"}}energizing honeyed apples{{color id="-1"}}.

It's a tad difficult to collect honey, but
so long as I carry {{color id="0"}}fire {{color id="-1"}}with me, the bees
won't attack.
I would go to any lengths to see my
Koko's smiling face. Even a few bee
stings here or there are well worth it!
