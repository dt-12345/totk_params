{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}WAH! {{delay8}}You scared me!{{delay8}} What are you doing

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}The Hyrule Castle{{color id="0"}} chasm {{color id="-1"}}is nearby.
It's dangerous, you know?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}For all I know, this {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}} could be
dangerous too.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd say MOST things are dangerous
these days, what with the Upheaval.{{delay8}}
Watch your back.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Did you need something from me?


The Hyrule Castle{{color id="0"}} chasm {{color id="-1"}}is nearby, so
my mind is on that at the moment. It's
dangerous, you know?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}For all I know, this {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}} could be
dangerous too.

Chasm?

---
label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}More like "chasms." You know, the creepy
openings in the ground. Ever since the
Upheaval, they're all over.
In this area, they're {{color id="0"}}beneath Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}
and {{color id="0"}}to the south of Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}.

I heard that members from the research
team went rooting around in some and
ended up in a bad way...
It's best to steer clear.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? {{delay8}}You mean, like the one right here?{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}When the shrines appeared, it caused
such a commotion that they landed in
the newspaper.
"{{color id="0"}}Mysterious Shrines {{color id="-1"}}Appear All Over the
World Overnight" was smack on the front
page, you know?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So far we know they're from the age
of legends...

But did they fall from the sky or emerge
from the ground?

And just what ARE they, anyway?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Aside from the {{color id="0"}}shrines{{color id="-1"}}, we've also got the
{{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}, of course.{{delay8}}

To tell you the truth, we don't know squat
about all of the things that sprung up due
to the Upheaval.{{delay8}}
But the shrines and chasms? They could
be dangerous. Which would be scary. So
we need to investigate them, pronto.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The people from the search party are
putting in long hours at Hyrule Castle,
so I intend to do the same.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Ugh... I was at the castle town and saw {{color id="0"}}something

there's no one there now. I've got to wrap things
up and head back to Lookout Landing.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}WHOA. {{delay8}}Was that opening there before?{{delay8}}
How could I have missed it...

label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? {{delay8}}Um, what is it?{{delay8}} We're close to the
{{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}here, so it's dangerous, you know?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}For all I know, this {{color id="0"}}shrine {{color id="-1"}}could be
dangerous too.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}My point is, lots of things are
dangerous ever since the Upheaval.{{delay8}}
So be careful, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}It's dangerous around here because it's
near the Hyrule Castle {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}.

And...


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Something's moving around{{color id="-1"}} in the {{color id="0"}}castle
town{{color id="-1"}}... I haven't really looked yet though.
Too scary.
It's probably best not to wander aimlessly
around here.

I'm planning on finishing my shrine
investigations quickly so I can head
back to Lookout Landing.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}If it came down to it, the monster-control crew at the
castle gates would help me...right?{{size value="100"}}
