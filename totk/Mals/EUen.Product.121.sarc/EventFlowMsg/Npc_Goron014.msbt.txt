{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If the president hadn't gotten involved
with {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}, none of this
would've happened.
At this rate, the Southern Mine—no,
{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}—is finished...

Good ol' hot springs.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The young Gorons are back to work, and
{{color id="0"}}Mine-Cart Land {{color id="-1"}}was completed safely.

I think it's about time I retire and tour
some hot springs.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Suppose I'll start with {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}}.


Actually, maybe I'll go farther than
that. Maybe I'll take a peek at
{{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}}.

Goron Hot Springs?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're the most famous hot springs
these lands over.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Just cross that bridge and head south—
ya can't miss 'em!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's an elderly fella at Goron Hot
Springs who really knows his stuff when
it comes to hot springs.
He told me about a place called
{{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}} that's
apparently legendary.
I can't decide whether to go to {{color id="0"}}Goron
Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}} or {{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}}.

Simmerstone Springs?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is just what I heard from the elderly
fella who's a regular at {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot
Springs{{color id="-1"}}. Guy knows his stuff.
He says Simmerstone is in a place called
{{color id="0"}}Gorko Tunnel{{color id="-1"}}, which is farther south than
{{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}}.
But that area is expansive, so if you're
going there, I recommend you ask him
for specifics.
