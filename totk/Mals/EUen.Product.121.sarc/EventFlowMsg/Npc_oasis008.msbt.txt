{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Just thinking about a voe being here, of
all places, has me pretty rattled.{{pageBreak}}But you know what would help me keep
calm? A nice, delicious beverage.

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}One Noble Pursuit, please!

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't believe I have to keep telling you
this, Pritana.{{pageBreak}}There's no way I can mix a Noble Pursuit
down here in the shelter.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Please address all complaints to the
sand shroud.

---
label: talk0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Pritana. Don't use my canteen as a place
to hole up.{{pageBreak}}I hope when the time comes, you find a
voe who can mix Noble Pursuits for you.

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}OK, don't panic. When a voe starts a
conversation with you...{{delay15}}the first step is...{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now then, when you notice a voe
watching you...

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I remember what I'm supposed to do...
I'm supposed to... {{delay15}}Nope, I'm drawing
a blank.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Even after all the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}} classes{{color id="-1"}},
as soon as I'm in a real-world situation,
all those lessons just vanish.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}I knew I should have spent more time practicing.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The return of the Noble Pursuit couldn't
have been better timed.{{pageBreak}}Did I really have a natural conversation
with a voe?{{pageBreak}}It wasn't as hair-raising as I was afraid of.
Must have been all that practice.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It's all thanks to you. Sarq!

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I've been so relieved ever since I had a
natural conversation with a voe. That voe
being you, I mean.{{pageBreak}}It wasn't as hair-raising as I was afraid of.
Must have been all that practice.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It's all thanks to you. Sarq!

label: talk0017

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been so anxious about talking to a
voe, but I felt like you and I had a pretty
natural conversation.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If you wouldn't mind...it would be nice for
you to swing by the "Voe and You" class
again. {{delay8}}If you feel like it.

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Heheh. {{delay8}}Hey, listen to this.{{pageBreak}}I finally had a normal conversation with
a voe!{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}And believe it or not, {{delay8}}the key to it all was
a Noble Pursuit!

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hah. Good for you.{{pageBreak}}And I'm not surprised. I first came up with
the recipe when I was out searching for
my own one true voe.

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Wow, you don't miss a trick!{{pageBreak}}You'll have to teach me the finer points
of vai-voe relations sometime.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Say, let me ask you something.{{pageBreak}}How did you use Noble Pursuit on your
own quest for a special voe?

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's nothing to it. Look into his eyes
and say this...{{pageBreak}}"I had you in mind when I mixed this
drink." {{delay15}}Exactly like that.

---
label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So cool!

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You've got game!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey.{{pageBreak}}Don't look now, but...{{delay15}}that's a voe talking to
us, right?{{size value="100"}}

label: talk0024
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey.{{pageBreak}}Don't look now, but...{{delay15}}that's a voe watching
us, right?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0008
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I think you're right.{{pageBreak}}But I've just started with the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}} class{{color id="-1"}},
so I'm not sure what to do about it.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0021

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Well, for now...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey, Nali?{{pageBreak}}I'm thinking it might be time soon for me
to go out and find my special voe.

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What, already? {{delay8}}Isn't that moving a little
fast? {{delay15}}Besides, there's all sorts of chaos
going on in the outside world right now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Maybe you should get some advice from
that trio of graduates from the class?{{pageBreak}}I think they're still hanging out around
Outskirt Stable.

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm...yeah, maybe. A short trip could be
a good chance to get more practice in.

label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey, did you hear about the mysterious
prophecy from Patricia?

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}}? Isn't that the chief's beloved
sand seal?

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I hear if you give her a splash fruit, she
says a string of strange numbers.{{pageBreak}}And I thought...{{delay8}}maybe those numbers are
code for some {{color id="0"}}location{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What? {{delay15}}Oh...I get it.{{delay15}} {{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're hoping it's a
clue to where you'll find your beloved voe.
{{delay15}}Am I close?

---
label: talk0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Yes! Exactly, {{delay15}}Nali.{{pageBreak}}We have to go see Patricia together,
and soon.
