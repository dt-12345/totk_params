Where's the style in that?

label: Balloon03

At last...

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We're hands on with the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} at
last! I can't believe it.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Um, Letty... This chunk is just a small
piece of one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. Nothing
much, really.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I mean, compare it to the main sites, like
that {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}} over there. It's broken in
two, but you can still see the full ring.

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, we can't visit that one, by {{color id="0"}}order
of Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} herself. No one's
allowed to go anywhere near it.

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So, isn't getting close up to this chunk
here something at least?

We can sweep up some of the fragments
and sneak 'em away. We gotta study
these ruins somehow...{{delay15}}huh?

---
label: Talk49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sure, this is only a small chunk, but it's
way easier to go hands-on with.

We can sweep up some of the fragments
here and sneak 'em away. We gotta study
these ruins somehow...{{delay15}} Huh?

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Don't mind me! I'm just, heh, definitely
leaving everything just as I found it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wait!{{delay15}} You're not with the survey team,
are you?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Phew! I thought we were gonna get
yelled at again.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We really want to become members of
the Zonai Survey Team, so we came here
to study the ruins.
Did you know that {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} have
been found only in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
and nowhere else?
That's why the Zonai Survey Team sent
its {{color id="0"}}specialists{{color id="-1"}} to examine them.

We figured this was a great opportunity
to learn all sorts of things.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But Letty has been running all over the
place to look at this and that, so we've
gotten nowhere fast.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Come on! I'm sorry already.


But after we're done here...want to see
the {{color id="0"}}stone slab {{color id="-1"}}found in each of the Ring
Ruins? Huge discoveries, they say!

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Naturally! Let's see how many of the {{color id="0"}}five
Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} we can visit to see those!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All right! What to do after this...

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Of all the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, I wish we could
enter that one—any part of it. And best
of all, the section that's {{color id="0"}}floating{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda gave the order{{color id="-1"}} for
everyone to stay away from it.

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Then we'll just visit the Ring Ruins that
we ARE allowed to enter.

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Four of the {{color id="0"}}five Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell
around the village are open to visitors.
So we'll go to some of those.

---
label: Balloon01
---
Over here, maybe?

---
label: Balloon04
---
Hmm...

---
label: Balloon05

Exploring is hungry work.

---

So...tired...

*snore*

---

*sigh* Rain...

---
label: Talk24

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Morning! We certainly run into each
other often.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello! We certainly run into each
other often.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good evening! We certainly run into each
other often.

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}We certainly run into each other often,
don't we? Would you like to shelter from
this rain together?

---
label: Talk07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}stone slab carved with writing{{color id="-1"}} was
discovered in each of the {{color id="0"}}five Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
that fell around Kakariko Village.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm going to see one of them now!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}stone slab carved with writing{{color id="-1"}} was
discovered in each of the {{color id="0"}}five Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
around Kakariko Village.
I heard the Zonai Survey Team's leader
is making sense of all that writing.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's truly amazing that he can read things
that were written long, long ago!

I want to learn to read this kind of
writing someday too.

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Aha! If the ruins fell here, then they
must have come from some place in
the sky, right?
This is amazing, Totsie!

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}From the sky... You know, a {{color id="0"}}sky-island
specialist{{color id="-1"}} works at the huge Ring Ruin
on the northwest side of the village...

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The sky islands are those things just
floating in the sky, right?

I really want to ask him about what all
that is up there!

---
label: Talk52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh! How do you even get to places that
are so high up?

I was told there were footholds, but it's
basically a cliff!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I've heard that the Zonai Survey Team
lets you use their balloons after you
become a member.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}After we join up, we'll be able to do that
together someday.

For now, we'll have to make our way on
foot while we study on our own.

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The ruins here are hugely important, and
the Zonai Survey Team is pretty good
about letting you know what's what.
They even let people go read the
{{color id="0"}}writing they deciphered {{color id="-1"}}on each stone
slab for themselves. Pretty great!

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hear that the village chief insisted on
them being open about what they
discover.
The village is drawing a lot of tourists
because of that.

She seems pretty smart, despite only
recently stepping into her position.

---
label: Talk53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}How great!


Kind of inspires me to make sure we study
these ruins so we become super-smart
members of the survey team!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Five rings{{color id="-1"}} fall in a village... {{color id="0"}}Stone slabs{{color id="-1"}}
bring us words from long ago... What
does it all mean?
I want to join the Zonai Survey Team so
I can help solve this mystery. But that
will have to wait...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm too hungry to think right now.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I want to solve the mysteries of the {{color id="0"}}five
ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell in this village and of the
{{color id="0"}}stone slabs{{color id="-1"}} here, but...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I can't solve mysteries with an empty
stomach.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So...hungry...


I'm glad there are {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}} ruins around here
to study, but it's exhausting running
between them all.

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We should cook up something refreshing.
We have {{color id="0"}}swift carrots{{color id="-1"}}, so what do you
think? {{color id="0"}}Carrot stew{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oooh! Good idea!


We even have all of the ingredients...
swift carrots, goat butter, milk, and
Tabantha wheat.{{delay8}} Go for it, Totsie!

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? You want me to do it? I barely know
which end to hold on a ladle.

---
label: Talk51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}But I barely even know how to start a fire!

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Well, darn. I was getting excited about
that {{color id="0"}}carrot stew{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Takes all kinds, I guess.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What is happening? I'll just wait until this
little climbing-on-things adventure is over.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Five rings{{color id="-1"}} fall in a village... {{color id="0"}}Stone slabs{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All the rain makes things slippery, and
then there's the thunder too. Scary!
Mysteries can wait until better weather.
