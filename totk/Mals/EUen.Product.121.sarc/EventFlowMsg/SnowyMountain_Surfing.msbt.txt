The legendary treasure...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hello! My name is Nazbi.{{delay8}} I'm a treasure
hunter and adventurer extraordinaire,
undaunted by even the coldest snow!

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This area is frozen solid and packed
with monsters. No one in their right
mind would set foot here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Except me, of course! {{delay8}}There surely must
be treasure resting here on this mountain,
where everyone else fears to tread!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That's what drove me to travel all this way
to Mount Lanayru.{{pageBreak}}Until I saw you, I really thought I'd be the
only one.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You must be here for the same reasons
I am. {{delay8}}And if you are, you'll be wanting to
know what I know about the treasure.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The truth is, by sheer luck I overheard
{{color id="0"}}a legend relating to the treasure {{color id="-1"}}on this
mountain while I was on my way here.{{pageBreak}}I knew I was a genius for assuming there
was treasure on Mount Lanayru!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you want to hear the legend too?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Great! {{delay8}}Then listen up!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}For I am Nazbi, {{delay15}}the treasure hunter with
nothing to hide!

label: talk0013_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The legend goes like this...{{delay8}}

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"Skim across snow, from the spring high
in the heavens to the mountain below.{{pageBreak}}"Pass through the rings of light to see the
Light of Blessing."

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}What do you think? {{delay8}}That was the real
legend of a real treasure, passed down
on this very mountain!{{pageBreak}}And you know that with a name like
{{color id="0"}}Light of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}, the treasure's gotta
be worth a bundle!

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I suspect the {{color id="0"}}spring high in the heavens{{color id="-1"}} is
referring to these springs. {{delay8}}The treasure
is as good as found!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}All except for the "finding it" part.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I don't know what to do with the "{{color id="0"}}rings of
light{{color id="-1"}}" bit. {{delay8}}I don't see anything like that
around here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}But I won't give up! {{delay15}}Because, you see...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I am Nazbi, the dauntless treasure
hunter!{{delay15}} Not to be confused with my
noble steed, Dauntless.

Where's the treasure?!

---
label: talk0020

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey there! {{delay8}}I'm Nazbi, the treasure hunter!{{delay8}}
I'm searching these mountains for a
treasure based on a {{color id="0"}}legend {{color id="-1"}}I heard.

---
label: 0002
---
A legend, you say?

---
label: 0001
---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk0021

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yeah! {{delay8}}Like all the best legends, I'm sure
it's 100 percent true!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I feel like I told you this once before, but
it's fine! {{delay8}}I'd talk about the legend of this
mountain all day if someone would let me!

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}My gut tells me this is the {{color id="0"}}spring high in
the heavens{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Except... {{delay8}}I don't see the {{color id="0"}}rings of light {{color id="-1"}}that
the legend mentioned anywhere!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm. {{delay8}}Could there be a {{color id="0"}}spring high in
the heavens{{color id="-1"}} somewhere other than here?{{pageBreak}}I don't see how. We're standing at pretty
much the summit of Mount Lanayru.
What's higher than here?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I guess there's the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Towers{{color id="-1"}} and
such that you can see above.{{pageBreak}}But where are these {{color id="0"}}rings of light {{color id="-1"}}I was
promised? {{delay8}}And more to the point, where's
this {{color id="0"}}Light of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Gotcha! {{delay8}}Till we meet again, my kindred
spirit in risking life and limb for that
sweet, sweet treasure!

label: talk0024

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You must be a fiend for treasure, asking
me about this again. {{delay15}}That's fine!{{delay8}} I love
talking about this stuff!

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I'm Nazbi! Does that answer all your
questions? {{delay15}}Or did you want to hear the
{{color id="0"}}legend{{color id="-1"}} of this mountain?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Huh? {{delay8}}You found it?!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}The spring high in the heavens was...{{delay8}}in
the sky? {{delay8}}You went through the rings of
light and a shrine appeared?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}How do I put this delicately...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Way to go! {{delay8}}That's amazing! {{delay8}}As a kindred
spirit, I'm not upset at all that you found
the mountain's treasure. {{delay8}}I'm proud!{{pageBreak}}The treasure is yours, of course. No need
to split it with me!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Because, you see...{{delay8}}I'm Nazbi, the treasure
hunter who knows that the past is the
past. I look only to the future!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}That said, I think I'll stick around on this
mountain a while longer.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Finding one legendary treasure doesn't
rule out there being more to discover!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Till we meet again, {{delay8}}my kindred spirit in
risking life and limb to chase legends!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}You wanna know why I do this? {{delay8}}The truth
is, it's all for my faithful steed!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Turns out horses eat a lot. {{delay8}}And being a
growing horse, mine eats more than most.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}My loyal steed has chewed right through
all my savings. {{delay8}}I've gotta get rich quick.{{delay8}}
