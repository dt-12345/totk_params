Pretty...

label: talk001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}No touching! That's mine!

---
label: talk016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's even a shimmery light coming off
of it...{{delay15}} It's super special.

---
label: talk002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Isn't that green color of the stone so
pretty?{{delay15}} I found it myself.

---
label: 0002
---
I want it.

---
label: 0005
---
Goodbye.

label: talk004

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Huh? You can't have it!{{delay8}} No, no! I found it!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hm... {{delay15}}But if you do something for me...{{delay8}}
MAYBE I'll consider it.

---
label: talk006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}So?{{delay8}} Help me out, and I'll probably give
you this pretty stone.

---
label: 0000
---
Sure.

---
label: 0001
---
No, thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}OK!{{delay8}} The thing is, I love {{color id="0"}}golden apples{{color id="-1"}}.
And a pretty stone is pretty, but I can't
really eat it...
So if you bring me {{color id="0"}}five golden apples{{color id="-1"}},
I'll trade you one pretty stone!

label: talk007

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Keep following this path and go real super
far on it.

---
label: talk008

You'll find a big bog called Mido Swamp,
and on the north side of the bog are trees
where {{color id="0"}}golden apples {{color id="-1"}}grow.
But there have been more monsters
recently,{{delay15}} so going there to pick them
is hard now...
Oh! Oh yeah, also the bog is bottomless,
so don't fall in!

---
label: talk005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As long as they're golden apples, I don't
care where you get them.

So please bring me {{color id="0"}}five golden apples{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: talk019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm?{{delay15}} Could it be that you have five
golden apples?

---
label: 0006
---
Here you go.

---
label: 0007
---
I don't.

---
label: talk010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmph.{{delay15}} Well then, please don't touch my
pretty stone.

---
label: talk018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Look at the beam of light coming from the
stone!{{delay15}} Yes, yes, this is a very special
stone indeed!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You want this stone pretty bad, huh?{{delay8}}
I can see it in your eyes.

---
label: talk011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Well, will you get me the{{color id="0"}} golden apples{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Farther up this path is the bottomless
Mido Swamp. On its north side are trees
where golden apples grow.
If you want my pretty stone, I'll trade you
for {{color id="0"}}five golden apples{{color id="-1"}}!

label: talk003
