the Upheaval.{{pageBreak}}But this is genuinely the best garden
in Hyrule!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry. I have a bit of a chip on my
shoulder. I shouldn't let my temper
get the best of me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, I'll get it back to tip-top shape
soon. So until then...{{pageBreak}}Just look at it and imagine how it'll be
when it's once again the best garden

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Is that what you were hoping to hear from
us?! {{delay8}}Just leave us alone already!{{pageBreak}}Thanks to Magda and Princess Zelda's
fiery determination, we've grown into a
blaze of color across the soil!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}As if your puny fires could burn us. {{delay8}}You

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}We told you already, that HURTS! {{delay8}}What
would we do if our petals got torn off?!{{pageBreak}}We are beautiful living things, who never

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}We've told you time and again how painful
that is!{{pageBreak}}All the world loves a flower, you know.
Flowers are beautiful, colorful, and have
a pleasant scent.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}It's no surprise that we're so cherished.
But it is surprising that you would go out
of your way to hurt us.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Do you think that makes you tough?
Hurting poor, innocent, defenseless
things?{{pageBreak}}Oooh. So scary. Whatever, just don't

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi"}}I thought we said to keep your grubby
fingers off!{{pageBreak}}Did you think we were complaining
because we like to hear ourselves talk?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Now that you know we're serious, let's
hope it settles into that thick skull.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Oooh, we see what's going on here.
You're doing this on purpose for the
attention, huh?{{pageBreak}}Look, if you want someone to talk to
you, go someplace like a stable with lots
of people around.{{pageBreak}}There should be one somewhere north
of here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}What possessed you to pester a bunch of
farming tools for attention, anyway?!

---
label: Talk0037

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's what the farm tools you tried
to touch would be griping, if they
could gripe.{{pageBreak}}I need those to work on the {{color id="0"}}best garden
in Hyrule{{color id="-1"}}, so could you please keep your
hands off?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}We love getting watered! {{delay8}}You've put a tad
more lushness in our petals. Look at us
flourish under your care!{{pageBreak}}Sure, you might've been a teeeeeensy
bit rough with us, but that's fine. {{delay15}}It's the
thought that counts more than anything.
Thanks again, good friend!

some love!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait a minute, mister. You're overdoing it.{{pageBreak}}Can't you see what the weather's like
right now? It's raining, bud! RAINING!{{pageBreak}}Don't try and force more water down our
throats after we've already had our fill!{{pageBreak}}We're sure you mean well, but check in
with Magda first before you drown us out
of love.

label: Talk0046

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's what the flowers you tried to water
would beg you, if they could beg.{{pageBreak}}I appreciate that you're trying to help,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Are you back to check on the
flowers again?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Did you find yourself unable to sleep
until you'd checked on the flowers?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Are you braving the rain so you could
come check on the flowers?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Most of the flowers that the princess and
I worked hard to plant have been ruined.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But I'm going to work with that guy from
the stable to get the garden good as new.{{pageBreak}}When the princess comes back, I'll be
ready to greet her with a garden that's
prettier than ever.

---
label: Talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now then! There's no time to rest!{{pageBreak}}I need to restore Hyrule's best garden as

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That's what the flowers you ruined would
be screaming, if they could scream.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}So listen to them, and don't do such
awful things!
