{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Welcome to South Akkala Stable, brrr!


Do you like horseys?


I used to like bugs when I was little, but
now I like horseys the best!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm practicing so I can be a horsey when
I grow up! {{delay8}}Neeeigh!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh, oh! Did you hear?


They say there's a {{color id="0"}}god of horseys {{color id="-1"}}on the
road {{color id="0"}}north {{color id="-1"}}of here!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I want to meet him!

label: Talk11

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I really wanted to talk to the li'l Cucco
who gives prophecies.

I was going to ask if I'm gonna be a
horsey when I grow up.

But it wasn't there. {{delay8}}Weeeird.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's OK! I know if I practice, I'll become
a horsey eventually! {{delay8}}Neeeigh!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}If you take the road north to {{color id="0"}}East Akkala
Stable{{color id="-1"}}, you can meet the god of horseys.

I wanted to ask him to turn me into
a horsey.

But my sister said it's too far...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So I'll just become a horsey on my own!{{delay8}}
Neigh! Clop, clop!

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wanted to gallop around in the rain,
since horseys don't mind getting wet.

But my big sister says I'll catch a cold...


Maybe I should talk to the {{color id="0"}}god of horseys{{color id="-1"}}
at {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}. I'll ask him to make
the rain go away!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I wonder what kinds of wishes the {{color id="0"}}god of
horseys {{color id="-1"}}can grant?

Can he give horses big, poofy manes?
Or make them all sparkly?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I know he's at East Akkala Stable, which
you can get to by taking the road {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}.

But my big sister says it's too far away.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}When I become a horsey, I'll be able to
take everyone there! {{delay8}}Clop, clop, clop!
