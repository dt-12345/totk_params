I can't believe they lost...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey. Don't even think about looking down
on our noble guards, understand?

Not only have they adapted to a
{{color id="0"}}brand-new training regimen{{color id="-1"}}—one
focused on mobility...
but they dove straight into battle without
hesitation against the {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}They have
nothing if not their pride.

---
label: talk0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Not even the {{color id="0"}}new training regimen {{color id="-1"}}could
prepare our noble guards for all the
recent events...
What's going to happen the next time
those {{color id="0"}}Gibdo{{color id="-1"}} things show up?

---
label: 1001

A training regimen?

label: 1002
---
Gibdos?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've only heard about it secondhand,
but the guards have been training hard
to improve their desert mobility.
You see, {{delay8}}some time ago,{{delay8}} right when {{color id="0"}}Lady
Riju{{color id="-1"}} had become chief...

Gerudo Town faced a major crisis.


After it was resolved, {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}} swore that
our military forces would be prepared to
face any new threats that came along.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Unfortunately, that was a tougher task
than anyone thought.{{delay15}} Luckily, {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}}'s
close friend Princess Zelda came to visit.
The princess suggested that the Gerudo
learn to be more in touch with the
desert itself.
This inspired {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}}, and she proposed
a new training regimen. At least, that's
what I heard.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have
helped against those {{color id="0"}}Gibdo{{color id="-1"}} things.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}} are strange monsters.


Our spears didn't even scratch them when
the guards tried to fight.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can't think of a time where monsters as
ferocious as these prowled the desert...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Even with the new training regimen the
troops went through, these monsters are
too tough.
Brute force won't help much if you run
into them. Be clever. Better yet, {{color id="0"}}think up
some kind of new weapon to fight them{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I don't want to see any more injured
people in need of care. {{delay15}}That includes
you, so be careful.

label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey... Isn't Kara Kara Bazaar in trouble
right now? Were you planning on heading
there, by chance?

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What do you need?{{delay8}} Are you looking
for someone?

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In case you're wondering, the soldiers all
went to face the {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Despite them being elite soldiers who
completed the {{color id="0"}}new training regimen{{color id="-1"}}...
some still aren't healed from the last fight.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'd have jumped in if I were still on active
duty, but all I can do nowadays is wait
and pray for their safe return...

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you planning to go? I ask because I'm
tired of caring for the injured, so...

Be careful.

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I hear you took part in the effort to
repel those Gibdo things that were
attacking the town.{{delay8}} Sarqso...
But it's not over yet, is it?

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's been talk of the new training
regimen getting started again once the
sand shroud clears up.
I need to come up with something to help
revitalize our noble guards...

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I understand that you are free to make
use of whatever you find around here.

If you get hungry, you can use the
cooking pot to prepare something.

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you want, you could go chat with
Sudrey. She should be up at the barracks,
I believe.

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_00"}}What?

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, at last we can finally see the sky
again. I'm not going to miss the sand
shroud one bit.
I've heard all there is to hear about
what happened. You were involved,
weren't you?
The chief must've foreseen what was
going to happen early on. That would
explain why she invited you here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}She was only a vehvi when I was in charge
of protecting her predecessor.

But sometime between then and now, she
grew into the best vai among all of us.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It looks like maybe, {{delay8}}just maybe, {{delay8}}this old
soldier might just be able to finally relax...

label: near0002

What're they fighting over?

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ugh, they are so loud. What could Pokki
be refusing to drop this time...

It's none of my business, really. Just an
old habit...

When I was an active guard, I had to be
aware of everything that was going on.
It's a tough habit to break.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The soldiers are all restless and ready to
get back to the training regimen now that
the {{color id="0"}}training area{{color id="-1"}} is open again.
I understand though. The recent events
were pretty rough on everyone, and they
want to be ready for what comes next.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If I wasn't retired, I'd be right there with
them. "In the vanguard," so to speak.

---
label: 1004
---
Training area?

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're interested in checking it out,
it's located {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} of town.

Be aware though... It's right in the middle
of the harsh desert, so make sure you're
prepared before you head out there.

If I wasn't retired...

label: talk0015

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I finally have the peace of mind to be able
to relax and get a good night's sleep.
Please, let me sleep just a bit longer...
