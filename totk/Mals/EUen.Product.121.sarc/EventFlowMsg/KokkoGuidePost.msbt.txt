{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, hello. {{delay8}}Welcome in.{{pageBreak}}Those old coots finally made up, {{delay8}}so I have
a strong stock of ingredients for sale
again.
Except...there is one little problem.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Bird eggs{{color id="-1"}} are still in short supply around
here.{{pageBreak}}The Cuccos still lay their eggs every
{{color id="0"}}morning{{color id="-1"}}, of course, {{delay8}}but they just started
{{color id="0"}}laying them in a new spot{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I tried following them once to find their
new nesting place, {{delay8}}but I'm not as quick
on my feet as I once was.{{delay15}}
Given how well our bird eggs sell, {{delay8}}I
usually like having {{color id="0"}}10{{color id="-1"}} or so on hand,
so I can easily restock them.{{delay8}}
But oh, well.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you for being such a devoted
customer.{{delay8}}

Now that those old grouches made up,{{delay8}}
I should be able to replenish my stock
right away.{{delay15}}
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}Though I suppose I'll be out of {{color id="0"}}bird eggs{{color id="-1"}}
for a while yet...{{delay15}}

The Cuccos still lay their eggs every
{{color id="0"}}morning{{color id="-1"}}, of course, {{delay8}}but they've recently
started {{color id="0"}}laying them in a new spot{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I tried following them once to find their
new nesting place, {{delay8}}but I'm not as quick
on my feet as I used to be.
Those eggs sell very well for us, {{delay8}}so even
{{color id="0"}}10 {{color id="-1"}}or so would be a huge help.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'm sorry.{{delay8}} I do have things other than
{{color id="0"}}bird eggs{{color id="-1"}} in stock.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}A ways back, the Cuccos changed where
they {{color id="0"}}lay their eggs{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}They run off to their
new nest whenever {{color id="0"}}morning{{color id="-1"}} comes.{{delay15}}
I usually like to have {{color id="0"}}10 {{color id="-1"}}eggs to sell,{{delay8}}
but there's not much chance of that...{{delay15}}
