Bow{{color id="-1"}} to my fully-fledged son, of course.{{pageBreak}}But...it does leave me without the bow
I've used for so long.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}An elder shouldn't go unarmed, so I'll
be crafting myself another one as soon
as I can.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The bow I gave Tulin was a masterpiece.

just as good.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}If you want your own {{color id="0"}}Great Eagle Bow{{color id="-1"}},
