It's just so weird...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ugh, what is with these weird vibes?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, are you an adventurer too? You feel
the vibes, right? The strange vibes in the
air all around here?

---
label: 0000
---
The...vibes?

---
label: 0001
---
I feel the vibes.

---
label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Phew! Another vibe feeler! I was starting
to worry that it might just be me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The forest ahead is the {{color id="0"}}Lost Woods{{color id="-1"}}, and
it's always been...pretty weird. If you got
lost, you'd wind up back at the entrance!
But now, the fog in there's gotten even
thicker. Take two steps into the forest,
and it'll spit you right out.

label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The vibes! I mean...the fog! In the forest
up ahead!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Not too long ago, you could at least walk
into those woods, but now you {{color id="0"}}can't
progress at all{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Lost Woods{{color id="-1"}} up ahead have always
been pretty weird, but they've gotten
even weirder of late.
Before, you could at least walk a ways
into the woods, but now {{color id="0"}}you can't
progress at all{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oho? Are you a fellow adventurer? Then
listen close, friend, I've got something
good to share.{{pageBreak}}Behold!

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You see it? That structure with the whole
swirling-green situation going on?

They've been showing up everywhere.
Gets your adventurer's heart pumping for
some exploration, huh?

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Thing is, no matter how you try, you'll get
enveloped in fog and expelled from the
forest before you can get close.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But while I was investigating, I noticed
something interesting.{{pageBreak}}Look, up in the sky!

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You see those floating islands?

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I bet you could get a great view looking
down from up there.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'd take a balloon up there myself, but...
I need to make sure everything is ready to
fly...{{delay15}}and swallow my fear of heights.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If you made your way to those sky islands,
you might just be able to approach that
strange ruin from above.
I've half a mind to take a balloon up there
myself, but the louder half is screaming,
"No! Nooo!" so it might take me a while.

label: Talk_18

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wha— Hey! Please don't touch that. It
wasn't exactly easy to get my hands on.
