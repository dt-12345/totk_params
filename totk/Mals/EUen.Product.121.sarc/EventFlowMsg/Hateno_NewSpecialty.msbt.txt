What a disaster...

label: Talk_45

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_00"}}Hey there! {{delay8}}Who's come to visit me out
in the field? {{delay8}}Oh.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, hi there. I still owe you one after the
mayoral election.{{pageBreak}}I'm going to let you in on a little secret.{{pageBreak}}I've been doing some research toward
a test run of veggies using some Cece-
brand style.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}The two of us worked hard raising them.
They were almost ready for the harvest.{{pageBreak}}But then a pack of {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}came and
trashed the fields, so the whole crop
is ruined.

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm usually glad for the rain. It's good for
the crops, after all. But what's the point
when monsters will just trash it again?

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The two of us aren't tough enough in
a scrap to send those monsters packing.{{pageBreak}}What we need is a {{color id="0"}}bodyguard{{color id="-1"}} with some
muscle to stand watch over the crops...

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If nothing changes, those {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}will
have the run of the place every night.
And I worry they won't stop with veggies.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}What we need is a {{color id="0"}}bodyguard{{color id="-1"}} with some
muscle to stand watch over the crops...

I'll take the job.

---

---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmmm... {{delay8}}What are we going to do?

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh! {{delay8}}You'll handle it for us? {{delay8}}That's perfect!

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Based on our stakeouts, the monsters
come {{color id="0"}}late at night{{color id="-1"}} and seem to go back
where they came from {{color id="0"}}when the sun rises{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I can't let a traveler stand against those
monsters alone. I'll be there fighting right
beside you!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Or I'll try, at least. But if the monsters are
too much for us and I can't take the heat,
I hope you won't blame me for {{color id="0"}}retreating{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I know this is short notice, but I'm set to
go if you are. Ready to hold this field with
me until dawn?

---
label: 0000

All set!

---
label: 0001
---
Now's not a good time.

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Had other things in mind for today, eh?
Well, just let me know when you're ready.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Great! Then let's stay here and keep our
eyes peeled for monsters.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Are you ready to fend off the monsters?

---
label: Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}So it's you.

---
label: Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If these {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} can have their way with
our fields, who's to say they won't get
bolder and start attacking villagers?{{pageBreak}}We have to put a stop to their
raids somehow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'll help, of course! Can't expect a traveler
to protect our fields alone.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Then again...if the monsters rough me up
and I can't take any more, you'll excuse
me if I {{color id="0"}}retreat{{color id="-1"}}, I hope.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Are you ready? Should we start our
stakeout until the monsters show up?

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, it's you.

---
label: Talk_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}'Ello there. {{delay8}}I'm mighty sorry for getting
you wrapped up in this.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Oof...{{delay8}}the monsters sure whipped our
hides but good.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But we can't give up!

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Tonight's the night we'll protect this field
from those low-down monsters!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Th-this is about the time that monsters
usually come to lay waste to the field.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}When you see them get near the field,
send 'em packing!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I don't think the monsters like it when
dawn breaks, so we've just gotta hold out
until {{color id="0"}}the sun rises{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Th...{{delay8}}they're coming! {{delay8}}Please, Link! {{delay8}}Help!

---
label: Battle_02
---
{{anim type="Angry"}}No! I won't let them win!

---
label: Battle_04
---
{{anim type="Runaway_01"}}My strength's fading fast!

---
label: Battle_05
---
{{anim type="Runaway_00"}}I can't take much more...

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Urp... {{delay8}}I wasn't expecting to have to fight
this many monsters. {{delay8}}S...{{delay8}}save me!

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}I'll leave this up to you and Mayor Reede.
Sure, my field's important to me, but I
need to think of my home and family too.

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_01"}}I...{{delay8}}can't go on... {{delay8}}It's all up to you now.

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Hey! Where are you going?! Are we
making a strategic retreat?!

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}All right, I guess we're retreating for now!
Let's get to safety and come up with
a new plan.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}That was a lot more monsters than I was
expecting.

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Aww, that's a shame. {{delay8}}We just weren't up
to the job tonight.

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Aw, rats. {{delay8}}I went to all that trouble to raise
them from seeds, and now this.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The monsters will just keep coming unless
we can make a real dent in 'em.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But we'll get other chances. I hope you'll
be there next time too.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Well, what do you know! {{delay8}}The monsters
left along with the dawn. {{delay8}}My vegetable
field is saved!

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We've beaten so many monsters already
that there can't be any more coming.{{delay8}}
You did it, Link!{{pageBreak}}No need to wait for sunrise to know
it's over.

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}We... {{delay8}}We did it!

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Hey! Look at my pumpkins!

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Thanks to you, the pumpkins we worked
so hard on got the chance to grow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Aren't these pumpkins beautiful? See the
way they catch the sunlight and sparkle?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}That's it! {{delay8}}We should call these beauties
{{color id="0"}}sun pumpkins{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}Plump, delicious {{color id="0"}}sun pumpkins{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay15}}Yeah.{{delay8}}
I think that's the perfect name for them.

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Sun pumpkins! {{delay8}}What a great name!

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Here. This is our thanks for your help.

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Our veggies and fields are the real jewels
of Hateno Village. {{delay8}}We're lucky to have you
around protecting them. {{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}We'll just get Cece's approval on them
real quick, and then we can start selling
them as Hateno's signature produce.

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}None of this would have been possible
without you looking out for us.
