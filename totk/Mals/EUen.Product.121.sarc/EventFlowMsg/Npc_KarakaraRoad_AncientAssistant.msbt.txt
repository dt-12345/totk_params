{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Pat yourself on the back for making it
here. That's no mean feat.

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You came to see the {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}} too?{{pageBreak}}Well, this is the perfect spot. There's a
{{color id="0"}}clear view of the whole thing{{color id="-1"}} from here.{{pageBreak}}I just...don't know what it's supposed to
depict.{{delay15}} It looks kind of like a person. {{delay15}}Or
maybe a monster?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I want to get closer, but walking through
the desert is tough, especially with the
extreme temperature fluctuations.
If you try heading over there, make sure
you're well prepared.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What's up?{{delay8}} Ah, that {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}} really has a
hold on you, huh?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I just wish I knew what it depicted. It's
sort of person-like...{{delay15}}but also sort of
monster-like too.{{delay15}}
I want to get closer, but with these wild
temperature fluctuations, walking through
all that sand would be misery.
If you go, just make sure you're prepared.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Well! {{delay15}}Never thought I'd run into someone
else all the way out here.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}This cliff crumbled during {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}},
so this is as far as anyone can go.

It's so bad that it put {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon
Stable{{color id="-1"}} up ahead out of business.

If you were hoping to find a place to rest
and restock, {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar {{color id="-1"}}out {{color id="0"}}toward
the desert {{color id="-1"}}is your only option.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But the temperature in the desert shifts
from {{color id="0"}}extreme heat to extreme cold{{color id="-1"}}, and
walking through sand is a challenge.
If you want to cook something to prepare
yourself, you're welcome to use my pot.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Crumbling cliffsides, {{color id="0"}}extreme shifts in
temperature{{color id="-1"}}... Did anything escape the
effects of {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}?
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon Stable {{color id="-1"}}couldn't get
enough customers to keep itself
afloat anymore.{{pageBreak}}If you're looking for someplace to stock
up and collect yourself, head {{color id="0"}}toward the
desert{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Phew... I'm taking a little break.{{pageBreak}}Honestly, you should too. Getting here
can't have been easy.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}As if the {{color id="0"}}desert sand{{color id="-1"}} isn't bad enough,
the elevation differences in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo
Canyon{{color id="-1"}} really take it out of you.
Then there's the{{color id="0"}} harsh heat of the day
and biting cold of the night{{color id="-1"}}. If I weren't
pacing myself, I'd probably keel over.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's important to listen to your body, and
that includes resting once in a while!

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I think I'll rest a little longer and then
set out.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I'm not really looking forward to trudging
through the {{color id="0"}}desert sands{{color id="-1"}} or dealing with
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon{{color id="-1"}} elevation differences.
But maybe the {{color id="0"}}extreme temperature
changes between day and night{{color id="-1"}} will
distract me from all that...

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Traveling in the desert is really tough.


Take one step off the road and you'll be
up to your knees in sand. If you plan on
walking, plan on walking slow.
Honestly, it almost makes me wish I'd
thought ahead and borrowed a {{color id="0"}}sand seal{{color id="-1"}}
right at the start.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I swore to myself that I was going to
take this investigation one step at a time,{{delay15}}
and I meant that literally.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="0"}}Sand seals{{color id="-1"}} can move really fast in the
desert. It's like they're swimming over
the dunes!
I won't be doing any of that though. Just
trudging along, my feet sinking into the
sand. All for my investigation...

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The old cliff in this area crumbled during
the Upheaval.

The debris completely blocked off the
road I used to walk.

Luckily, they made a new one. If you're
going to the Digdogg Suspension Bridge,
use that.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I still can't believe the ravine road is
blocked. The Upheaval messed things
up even worse than I imagined.
If you need to get to the Digdogg
Suspension Bridge, you're going to
have to use the new road.

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Phew... {{delay15}} I finally made it.{{pageBreak}}You did too, huh? Great work.{{pageBreak}}The desert has a way of tripping you up.
Traveling through it takes time, even in
the best of circumstances.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm guessing you're here to see
the {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}So am I! Want to go take a look at
it together?

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I didn't come all this way only for my
investigation to end up half-baked.{{pageBreak}}Even if the sand trips me up and the
wild temperature changes alternately
freeze and fry me...
I swear I'll unlock the mysteries of
that {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh?{{delay15}} Hey, are you lost?{{pageBreak}}If you're looking for Gerudo Canyon
Stable, I'm afraid it's closed.{{pageBreak}}If you need to rest, your only real option
now is {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}, which is down
this road toward the desert.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As for me, I've got a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}to
investigate, so that's where I'm headed.{{pageBreak}}Who knows? Maybe I'll see you again.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The nearby Gerudo Canyon Stable isn't
accepting visitors anymore.{{pageBreak}}So if you need rest, why not follow the
road to the desert and make your way
to {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Meanwhile, I'll be heading over to the
{{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}for a little eyes-on research.{{pageBreak}}See you again, maybe?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Th-that was kind of scary. I wasn't

Talk about ferocious.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}How awful, attacking me out of the blue...
I couldn't even fight back.
