{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hello, there!{{delay8}} Of all people, it's the
one-and-only Link!

Welcome...{{delay15}}is what I'd like to say.{{delay8}}
The thing is, we're conducting an
investigation of the ruins here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}If you're looking for Prince Sidon, he can
be found at Mipha Court.

That's on the peak of Ploymus Mountain.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Prince Sidon can be found at Mipha Court.


I'm sure he'll be overjoyed to see
you, Link.

An investigation, eh?

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}*sigh* I will never understand the ways
of historians.{{delay15}} Can he not conduct the
investigation more cautiously?

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Oh! {{delay15}}Oh dear. {{delay8}}I certainly hope that you did
not overhear me...{{delay8}}*ahem* grumbling to
myself like that.
It's n-not as it sounds. {{delay8}}Really!

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Jiahto keeps interacting with dangerous
things. When I object, he insists it's
necessary for his research.
That makes things quite difficult for me,
as it is my job to guard him.{{delay15}} That is why
I gave in to a moment of grumbling.

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I understand that this is an investigation
of the ruins, but Jiahto is coming into
contact with all kinds of dangerous things.
I do wish he would show a little more
caution during his research. {{delay8}}As his
appointed guard, it makes me nervous.

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}The cliff crumbled as a result of the
Upheaval, and that revealed these
ancient ruins.
Prince Sidon immediately ordered a
thorough investigation.

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Jiahto is a historian, so this kind of thing
is his specialty. He was terribly excited
and is completely transfixed by the ruins.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Sure...{{delay8}} You know, I was assigned to escort
him, but it feels more like I'm looking after
a child who's found a new favorite toy.

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Jiahto is making a big fuss.


But honestly... {{delay8}}Even if I asked him to
explain his excitement, a soldier like me
probably wouldn't understand.

---
label: talk0016

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Jiahto seems to be making a big fuss...{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm? You're looking for King Dorephan?


I heard that he left a while back to
investigate the sludge.

That said, I am not allowed to leave here
because I'm on guard duty.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}For all I know, King Dorephan has already
triumphantly returned.

---
label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Do you know about the road that goes
down to Zora's Domain?{{delay15}} It's probably a
bit treacherous for a Hylian...
{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm sure you would be better off if you
had a map.{{delay8}} Please be careful out there.

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}OK, then. {{delay8}}Beware the sludge out there.

---
label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Link!{{delay8}} I'm so grateful that you helped out
with our investigation of the ruins.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Thinking back, the waterfalls were filthy
because of the sludge, and even I had a
rough time taking Jiahto here.
It must have been difficult for you to climb
here yourself, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hm... If only your {{color id="0"}}Zora armor {{color id="-1"}}was
operational.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}None other.{{delay15}} Oh, I suppose your reaction
means you have not yet spoken with
Lady Yona.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You already know this, but wearing the
{{color id="0"}}Zora armor {{color id="-1"}}allows you to climb waterfalls
with ease, even though you're a Hylian.
{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Lady Yona is attempting to repair it for
you. She's in the domain, so I suggest
you go and speak with her.

require an {{color id="0"}}ancient arowana {{color id="-1"}}in order
to repair it.
If you can find one, I ask that you deliver
it to Lady Yona at once so that she can
repair your {{color id="0"}}Zora armor {{color id="-1"}}for you.

Thanks to you, {{delay15}}I can finally give my father
a good report.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}That said... {{delay8}}It is a little embarrassing when
he hears a report of mine and starts
jumping with joy.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}My father was elated when I was selected
to be a security escort, but I could tell he
was also worried for me.

calm his fears.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Since there were parts of that stone
slate that were unaccounted for...{{delay8}}

Well, I assumed it would take much longer
to conclude our investigation.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}To think that you would find the missing
piece and repair it! {{delay15}}I'm honestly in awe
of you.

the domain.

I'm motivated to follow the example of my
esteemed elders so that I can protect
Zora's Domain as best I can.
Take the great Captain Bazz, for instance.{{delay15}}
He went off to the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}to the
west of the domain for an investigation.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}He won't even allow something like that
foul sludge to intimidate him! I aspire to
be that bold one day.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Hm. Come to think of it, Captain Bazz has
not yet returned.{{delay15}} Not that there's any
cause for concern, of course.
