Yes.

Not yet.

The Goddess Statue smiles upon you...

---
label: talk01
---
You who have conquered the shrines and
claimed their {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk02
---
But you do not yet have {{color id="0"}}four
Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}.

Seek out the {{color id="0"}}shrines{{color id="-1"}} scattered across
Hyrule, and face more challenges.

Return to me once you have claimed
{{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk04
---
You want a {{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}}, yes?

---
label: talk05
---
You want a {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}}, yes?

---
label: talk07
---
In exchange for {{color id="0"}}four Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}},
I will amplify your being. So tell me what it
is that you desire.

---
label: talk10
---
In exchange for {{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}},
I will grant you power.

---
label: talk08
---
I shall grant the power you seek.

---
label: talk09
---
I can offer you great power.

---
label: talk11
---
Go, and bring peace to the world...

---
label: talk13
---
It appears you still possess
{{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk14
---
Understood. Which power do you seek?

---
label: talk15
---
Your life force already tests the seams of
your being.

There is no need to increase your
{{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}} further.

---
label: talk16
---
Your being overflows with vigor.


There is no need to increase your
{{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}} further.

---
label: talk17
---
You already overflow with life force and
stamina. Increasing your power any
further may destroy you.

---
label: talk18
---
Increase your Heart Containers?

---
label: talk19
---
Expand your Stamina Wheel?

---
label: talk33
---
Link... It appears that you have sufficient
power. You should not seek to increase
this any further.

---
label: talk34
---
You also have a Sage's Will. For {{color id="0"}}four
Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}, I will make your bond with
a sage stronger.

---
label: talk36
---
I see you have four {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}
and four {{color id="0"}}Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}} already.

---
label: talk37
---
You have four {{color id="0"}}Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk35
---
But you don't have four {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}
or four {{color id="0"}}Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}.

Seek out {{color id="0"}}shrines{{color id="-1"}} and ruins scattered
across the world.

Return to me once you have claimed {{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}four Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk40
---
It appears you still possess {{color id="0"}}Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk41
---
But it seems you have no sage to build
a stronger bond with.

---
label: talk43
---
What power do you seek?

---
label: talk44
---
In exchange for {{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Sage's Wills{{color id="-1"}}, I will
make your bond stronger with any sage
you choose.

---
label: talk46
---
Now I will make your bond with
Tulin stronger.

---
label: talk48
---
Now I will make your bond with
Yunobo stronger.

---
label: talk50
---
Now I will make your bond with
Sidon stronger.

---
label: talk49
---
Now I will make your bond with
Riju stronger.

---
label: talk47
---
Now I will make your bond with
Mineru stronger.

---
label: talk51
---
You who have conquered the shrines and
claimed their {{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}.

I can offer you great power.

---
label: talk52
---
You want a Heart Container for those
{{color id="0"}}four Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}, yes?

---
label: talk53
---
You want a Stamina Vessel for those
{{color id="0"}}four Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}, yes?

---
label: talk54
---
You have vitality and vigor in abundance.


Seek to deepen your bonds with sages.
Go and search the ruins scattered around
the world.
When you have collected {{color id="0"}}four {{color id="-1"}}of an item
called Sage's Will, visit me again.
