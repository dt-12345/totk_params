{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Um, so, at our village...{{pageBreak}}There was a big pirate ship that showed
up like BOOM! And these scary guys
came out of it? These {{color id="0"}}pirate {{color id="-1"}}guys?
So my dad put me on his back and we got
out of there!{{pageBreak}}Then he walked for a long time...and I
think he turned left? And then we kept
going in one direction foreeever.{{pageBreak}}So from here, all you have to do is walk
forward a long, long way, and turn right!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Pretty amazing how I remembered the
directions, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The way we got here was we escaped

go right, that's how you get to our village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Pretty amazing how I remembered the

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I love {{color id="0"}}froggies{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But it's weird... Why are they all hiding?
Normally, tireless froggies love rain!

Do you think tireless froggies are scared
of pirates, too, and went to hide in {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wanted to play with the {{color id="0"}}froggies{{color id="-1"}}, but I
don't see any today...{{pageBreak}}Tireless froggies used to love rain as
much as I do. Maybe they got scared of
the pirates and went to hide in {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}.
