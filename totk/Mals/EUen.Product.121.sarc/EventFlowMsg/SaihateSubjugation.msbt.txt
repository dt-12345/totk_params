I wanna go home...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}Who the—{{delay8}} Mister, you must have a death
wish to make your way to this island.

---
label: Talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've heard the rumors, right? They say
this is where the pirates that attacked
Lurelin Village hide out.{{pageBreak}}I mean, I sure don't wanna be here...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But I'm on a mission to locate the pirates'
hideout for the monster-control crew.

---
label: Talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}From what I've seen, this island has
{{color id="0"}}three monster strongholds{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk0018
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}I do think the pirates' hideout is
somewhere on this island...

But I can't do a thorough search with
those strongholds in my way.

---
label: Talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I want to finish my scouting and go
home already. {{delay8}}If only those {{color id="0"}}monster
strongholds {{color id="-1"}}weren't there...

---
label: Talk0100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}By the by,{{delay8}} I just now saw a {{color id="0"}}pirate ship{{color id="-1"}}
approaching the island.

---
label: Talk0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But it's strange... As soon as it went
around {{color id="0"}}the rear side of the island{{color id="-1"}}, the
ship disappeared.

---
label: Talk0101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So where did it go?{{pageBreak}}Maybe the pirates really do have a
hideout on this island, and that's where
the ship disappeared to.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But that would make it the monster-
control crew's duty to find and {{color id="0"}}eradicate{{color id="-1"}}
them, not just scout things out...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I can handle one or two enemies, but that
sounds like...more. Ugh, I'm so nervous,
I'm frozen to this spot.
Do I retreat?{{delay8}} Or do I locate the {{color id="0"}}hideout{{color id="-1"}}
and try to fight the pirates myself?{{delay8}} Oooh,
what should I do?

---
label: Near0001
---
Three strongholds...

---
label: Talk0003_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}Hey, buddy...{{delay8}} You're still hanging
around here?

---
label: Talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's my mission to scout out the
pirates' hideout.

But there are {{color id="0"}}three monster strongholds{{color id="-1"}}
keeping me from investigating.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I wish those {{color id="0"}}strongholds{{color id="-1"}} were
gone. It'd make things much easier.

---
label: Near0002
---
It's gotten so quiet...

---
label: Talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}The island seems so much more tranquil...
{{delay15}}Could it be?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}You cleared out the monster strongholds?{{delay15}}
All three of them?!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hah!{{delay8}} You're amazing!{{delay15}} Oh, you don't even
know how big a help that is.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Perfect timing, too, since I just saw a
{{color id="0"}}pirate ship{{color id="-1"}} coming in.

---
label: Talk0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But as soon the ship rounded the {{color id="0"}}back of
the island{{color id="-1"}}, it disappeared.

---
label: Near0003
---
Do I have to?

---
label: Talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Just as the pirate ship went around the
{{color id="0"}}rear of the island{{color id="-1"}}, it vanished.{{pageBreak}}If they're mooring at their {{color id="0"}}hideout {{color id="-1"}}over
there, then this scouting mission just
turned into an {{color id="0"}}eradication{{color id="-1"}} one.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}The thought of which petrifies me...{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}So what now? Do I run home? Or do I
locate the {{color id="0"}}hideout{{color id="-1"}} and inevitably die
trying to {{color id="0"}}fight the pirate horde{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Near0005
---
Run? Or fight?

---
label: Talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What's that? {{delay8}}You found a pirate ship in a
cave around the back of the island?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Then that cave has to be their {{color id="0"}}hideout{{color id="-1"}}!
No doubt about it!

---
label: Talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}As much as I'd love to march right in
there and rout the pirates...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I'm only a scout. Even thinking about
taking on a force like that turns my legs
into jelly.
So what now? Do I slink away to safety
or {{color id="0"}}fight the pirates in their hideout{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'll just think it over until I can move
my legs again...

---
label: Talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If the pirates are hiding out on the rear
side of the island, then {{color id="0"}}eradicating{{color id="-1"}} them
would be for the betterment of society...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Y-you hear that, legs? Let's swallow those
nerves and get moving again. Please?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Do I retreat to safety or {{color id="0"}}storm the
hideout{{color id="-1"}}? I want to help, but I don't
want to throw my life away.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey!{{delay8}} I can tell just by looking at you that
something happened. What's up?

---
label: Talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey there.{{delay8}} Don't tell me...{{delay8}} Something else
happened, didn't it?

---
label: Talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}A cave?{{delay8}} Hidden around the back of the
island? And there was a pirate ship?!{{pageBreak}}You beat every single pirate on the ship
too?!{{delay15}} Holy cow!{{delay8}} You're like a one-man
monster-control crew!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I mean, I'm part of a monster-control
crew, and I still lost my nerve. Thanks
to you, I can finally breathe easy.

---
label: Talk0007_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} I should probably give you some
token of gratitude for risking your life!{{pageBreak}}Here. {{delay8}}Accept this with my thanks. 

---
label: Talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}You...{{delay8}}defeated every last pirate on the
ship?{{delay15}} That's incredible!{{delay8}} You're like a
one-man monster-control crew!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I was only planning on scouting the place
out. HQ's going to be thrilled to hear that
the pirates are no longer a threat!

---
label: Talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Heh heh...{{delay8}} Weren't expecting something
that rare, were you?{{pageBreak}}I picked it up on a previous monster-
control-crew expedition.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I've been holding on to it as a lucky charm
all this time, but you'll probably get more
use out of it than I would.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Huh?{{anim type="QuestionAngry_01"}} Hey, make some room in your
pouch already! {{delay8}}I'm offering you a
{{color id="0"}}Blue-Maned Lynel saber horn {{color id="-1"}}here!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Well, once you pare down that absurd

I'm that grateful!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}You really helped me out, so I'd love to
give you a {{color id="0"}}Blue-Maned Lynel saber horn{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Just let me know once you've made some
space in your pouch!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, perfect, you've made some room!{{delay15}}
Well then, once again...{{delay8}}please accept
this with my thanks.

---
label: Talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Now then, time to put together a report
on what happened here and finally leave
this island.
Once I'm back, I'm turning over a new
leaf. No more scaredy-Sesami. I'm going
to be capable and courageous like you!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So thanks for the help and the inspiration,
mister!{{delay8}} I hope I'll see you around!

Just about done...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hey!{{delay8}} You came back!{{pageBreak}}I still plan on leaving this island once I've
got my report written up for the monster-
control crew, but ah...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}This is a big island and gathering up all
the info I need takes time.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}So long as I'm here, I might as well
unwind a little, right? Just for a while...

---
label: Talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Once the report is written, I'll leave the
island...{{delay8}} Yeah.{{pageBreak}}It's a big island, so it's taking me a while
to get my info together, that's all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It's not at all related to how scenic and
relaxing this place is, no, sir.
