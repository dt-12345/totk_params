In fact, most of the gems that we have
{{color id="0"}}originally{{color id="-1"}} came from {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.

that are really, really far away. Or it
should, anyway.
All I see when I look through it is the bell
at the center of Hyrule Castle...

That's right. I know all about your hideout
