{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ow... Everything hurts... I guess I still
can't move...

Those things... It didn't matter how many
we took down.{{delay8}} They just kept coming.

Where in the world could they have been
coming from though?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Those things... Where could they have
been coming from?

No doubt the next battle will {{color id="0"}}challenge
our endurance{{color id="-1"}} too. {{delay15}}I've got to heal up,
replace my weapon, and be ready...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}They outnumbered us in the last battle
and were able to break our lines, but...

We won't let that happen this time!
We're fully prepared for a long fight that'll
{{color id="0"}}challenge our endurance{{color id="-1"}}! We won't lose!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We beat them, every last one of them,
yet I'm still jumping at shadows and on
edge at the slightest noise...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Battle after battle against an endless

It really wears on you after a while.

Time for the Training Area?

label: talk0000

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}At long last, it feels like the battle is over.
We made it through, despite injuries
and setbacks...
But there's no time to relax! I should
probably head to the {{color id="0"}}Training Area{{color id="-1"}} at
the {{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis{{color id="-1"}}.

Southern Oasis?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What, did you lose your map? It's an
oasis, and it is south of here. {{delay8}}The name
says as much.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Water is a rare commodity in the desert,
and while the place isn't exactly a tourist
hot spot, we Gerudo enjoy it well enough.
It's actually surprisingly far away. You
might want to rent a sand seal from the
{{color id="0"}}rental shop{{color id="-1"}} to make the trek easier.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah. It's a {{color id="0"}}training facility{{color id="-1"}} that {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}}
set up for the town guards to use
for training.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}For example, the battles against the
Gibdos showed me that my stamina and
ability to adapt could use some work.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Once I'm done here, I'm thinking of
heading out there and working on that.

Hm... The place is meant for just us
Gerudo. Technically.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I imagine you'd be allowed to use it,
though. You did fight alongside us.

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's near the {{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis{{color id="-1"}}. You could
always go and check it out, especially if
you're heading that way.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sav'orq!


It's important that we are able to defend
the town—we can't expect you to come
swooping in anytime there is danger!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe I'll relax at the {{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis{{color id="-1"}} for
just a bit before continuing on to the
{{color id="0"}}Training Area{{color id="-1"}}...
No, I should wait until after training.
There is no greater reward for hard work
than taking some time to relax...
