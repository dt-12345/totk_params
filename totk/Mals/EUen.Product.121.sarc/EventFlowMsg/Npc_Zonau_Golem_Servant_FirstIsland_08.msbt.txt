{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}This is a boarding area for mine carts.{{delay8}}

Hmm. {{delay15}}You do not seem to have an
{{color id="0"}}Energy Cell {{color id="-1"}}yet.{{pageBreak}}No {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell {{color id="-1"}}means no {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
That will pose a problem when it comes to
using this mine cart.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Return here once you have found an
{{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk_12

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You have returned. {{delay8}}And you still do not
have an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}This mine cart will not function without
one. {{delay8}}Nor will the {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} that rely

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Have you also forgotten to bring
{{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Oh. {{delay8}}I have never seen you before. This is
a loading area for mine carts. {{delay8}}You can use
a fan-type {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}} to get out.{{pageBreak}}But I do not detect an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} among
your possessions.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}{{color id="-1"}}You cannot use Zonai devices without
an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}. The same holds true for

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Have you still not acquired an
Energy Cell?{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}{{color id="-1"}}You will not be able to use Zonai devices
without one. Zonai capsules will also be
a problem for you.{{pageBreak}}It is currently impossible for you to use
a mine cart.{{pageBreak}}You should work on finding an
