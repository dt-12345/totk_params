A dead end?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That's strange.{{delay8}} There definitely should be
something up ahead...

---
label: talk_1001

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}How can I get past this?

What's the matter?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, are you investigating this place too?

label: talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Look...{{delay8}} See how this {{color id="0"}}stone statue{{color id="-1"}} has
fallen into the wall?

These statues are typically set in rows
with one sight line leading to the next
until they finally stop at an {{color id="0"}}old mine{{color id="-1"}}.
But this is different. This chain of statues
ends here.{{delay8}} I've looked all over, but there's
no sign of an old mine.

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Could it somehow be {{color id="0"}}inside this wall{{color id="-1"}}...
But I don't see any kind of entrance.

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh, well.{{delay8}} I found you here,{{delay8}} so at least
the statues led me to a hero.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hey! I see what you're doing! You're
ignoring me, probably thinking, "Ugh,
another Yiga Clan trap. I'll keep walking."

---
label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'm right, aren't I?

---
label: talk_1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, good timing!

---
label: talk_1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}statue{{color id="-1"}}'s the same as the others,
right?{{delay8}} The ones that lead to an
{{color id="0"}}abandoned mine{{color id="-1"}}?
But this row...ends here.{{delay8}} I've looked all
over, but there's no sign of an old mine.

---
label: talk_1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Do you know if there's anything {{color id="0"}}inside
the wall{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}} Or even a way to get inside?

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Normally, {{color id="0"}}stone statues {{color id="-1"}}like these are
arranged in a row leading to an {{color id="0"}}old mine{{color id="-1"}}.

But this row doesn't lead anywhere.{{delay8}}
I've looked all over, but there's no sign
of an old mine.
{{anim type="Sad"}}If there's no way to get {{color id="0"}}inside the wall{{color id="-1"}},
maybe it's just a misplaced set of statues.
Still, it's weird...
