Welcome!

label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thanks to you, my great-grandpa's dream
of a uniquely Hateno cheese wasn't lost.{{pageBreak}}I'm really and truly grateful for that.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This might sound out of the blue, but do
you want some {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}? I'd be
fine giving you some, if you want!{{pageBreak}}And don't worry if you can't afford it.
I'll accept {{color id="0"}}fresh milk {{color id="-1"}}as{{color id="0"}} trade{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}For customers willing to trek directly
to the pasture, it's the least I can do!

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm glad you came out here anyway.
It's worth making the cheese just for that.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even if it's late at night, I'm still glad you
came out here.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm glad you came out here. You should
stick around a while to take shelter from
the rain.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're here for Hateno cheese, pick out
whichever block you like from the ones
lined up there.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sorry, but I'm out of Hateno cheese
right now.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I also buy things, if you're in the market
to sell whatever you don't need.

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm glad you made the trek out. Since
you're here, you should treat yourself
to some {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}Don't worry about the price. If you don't
have any money, I'll {{color id="0"}}trade{{color id="-1"}} you the cheese
for some {{color id="0"}}fresh milk{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you for buying out my stock!{{pageBreak}}I'm going to wear out my gratitude
muscles if I keep thanking you so much.{{pageBreak}}Don't worry, I'll make more cheese!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I mean...I basically just make it for you...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0005
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm... It's not much of a trade if you
don't have any {{color id="0"}}fresh milk {{color id="-1"}}on your end.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You want to trade a bottle of {{color id="0"}}fresh milk{{color id="-1"}}
for one chunk of our {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oops. Your pouch is too full to hold any
of our delicious Hateno cheese.{{pageBreak}}Come back later after you make some
room. I'll be waiting here with a fresh
batch for you.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Good choice! Presenting a chunk of
thiiick, rich, highly nutritious, and
absolutely unbeatable Hateno cheese!

label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm only a one-woman cheese-making
operation, but stay as long as you like,
and buy to your heart's content!

---
label: Com_Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What are you thinking of selling?

---
label: Com_Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That, huh? I can part with {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}
for it. OK with you?

---
label: Com_Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thanks. Was there anything else you had
in mind to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_02b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sure, I'll find some use for this. Are you
still in a selling mood?

---
label: Com_Talk_02c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Got it. Selling anything else today?

---
label: Com_Talk_02d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You have a lot of stuff, huh? Is there
anything else you want to get rid of?

---
label: Com_Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Changed your mind? Fair enough.

---
label: Com_Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'll buy anything off of you, so don't hold
back on my account.

---
label: Com_Talk_05b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Take your time. Not like I was doing
anything important.

---
label: Com_Talk_05c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'll find a use for whatever you want to
sell me, I promise.

---
label: Com_Talk_05d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Relax. I don't want you to feel stressed
out when going through your pouch.

---
label: Com_Talk_13
---
Yeah? How many do you want to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_14
---
I'll pay {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} for {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}.

---
label: Com_Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh, sorry, but that's one thing I won't
buy off of you.

---
label: Com_Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}OK, you understand that I'm not going to
buy your clothes while you're still wearing
them, right? For obvious reasons?

---
label: Com_Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}How many you need?

---
label: Com_Talk_33
---
One is {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. How does
that sound?

---
label: Com_Talk_34
---
That's...my entire stock of those. For {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}},
I'll need {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}, OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_35
---
You mean your whole supply of {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}?
I can give you {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're going to buy that, we charge
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_Talk_52
---
OK, {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of those is {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I see. And you're sure you don't want any
of our rich, delicious Hateno cheese?

---
label: Com_Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There's no nice way to say this—you don't
have enough rupees for that.

---
label: Com_Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? Won't the cheese get smushed if you
try to fit it into a pouch that full?{{pageBreak}}Let's try this again sometime after you've
reorganized that thing.

---
label: Com_Talk_56
---
A single one will run {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 5500
---
Yes.

---
label: 5501
---
No.

---
label: 5502
---
I'll buy.

---
label: 5503
---
Never mind.

---
label: 5507
---
I'll take 'em all!

---
label: 5508
---
I'll sell them all.

---
label: TerrorImpulse_00
---
Hmm?

---
label: TerrorImpulse_01
---
What?

---
label: TerrorImpulse_02

Whoa!
