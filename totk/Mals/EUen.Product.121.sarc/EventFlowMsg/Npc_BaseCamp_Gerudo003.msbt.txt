{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're headed to the {{color id="0"}}Akkala Span{{color id="-1"}} up
ahead, you'll have to move carefully.{{pageBreak}}A{{color id="0"}} large number of monsters have taken

there's little I can do on my own.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This would be a perfect job for the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}A {{color id="0"}}large number of monsters are
occupying{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Akkala Span{{color id="-1"}} up ahead and
making it dangerous to cross.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wish the {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}} were
here, but they're busy with something at

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Take care if you're headed to the
{{color id="0"}}Akkala Span{{color id="-1"}} up ahead. A {{color id="0"}}large number
of monsters are occupying it{{color id="-1"}} right now.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I thought about trying to clear them out
myself, but figured I'd hardly put a dent
in them on my own.
Luckily, the {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}} is
headed their way. Those monsters might
already be dealt with.
It's nice to have a team we can rely on.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Akkala Span{{color id="-1"}} up ahead has been {{color id="0"}}taken
over by a bunch of monsters{{color id="-1"}}, which has
put me in a bit of a bind.
But the {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}} has set out
to take them down. The bridge might
already be monster-free!
That monster-control crew really is
something else.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A large number of {{color id="0"}}monsters had taken

I wonder if that was the {{color id="0"}}monster-control

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The monsters who took over the {{color id="0"}}Akkala

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It used to be that this path would lead
to Death Mountain...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Though with the increase in monsters, it's
fallen all to ruin.{{pageBreak}}Those {{color id="0"}}grasping{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}reddish-black monsters{{color id="-1"}}
that creep along the ground are especially
troublesome. Unsettling too.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You seem to know your way around a
sword well enough, but be careful not
to approach them carelessly.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The path to Death Mountain before us
has fallen to ruin with the resurgence
of monsters.
Those {{color id="0"}}grasping{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}reddish-black monsters{{color id="-1"}}
that lunge at passersby might be the
worst the path has to offer.
Some friendly advice—{{delay15}}if you must get
close, do so with caution.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Rain.{{delay8}} I grew up in the Gerudo region,
so it still feels so new to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}And I love it! The patter of the rain
covers your footsteps, so it's {{color id="0"}}harder
for monsters to hear you approach{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Footsteps are muffled on rainy days, so
it's {{color id="0"}}difficult for monsters to notice you
approach{{color id="-1"}}. It's pretty great!

label: GoRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The recent increase in monsters has made

{{color id="0"}}grasping{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}reddish-black ones{{color id="-1"}} that crawl
along the ground.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One touch from them and you'll feel your

Be careful out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Grasping{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}reddish-black monsters{{color id="-1"}} have

never cross paths with one.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It seems that a large number of monsters

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm on my way to investigate now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}If it's something I can take care of by

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sounds like all those monsters that took

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The increase in monsters has laid the
whole thing to waste.{{pageBreak}}And you have to be extra careful around
