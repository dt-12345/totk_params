The training area...

---
label: talk1008_0
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I understand what you're saying...


But right now it's a luxury that we even
get this much space in the shelter
for training.
It's only enough room for sparring, so that
will have to do for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}But, Captain Teake! We need the {{color id="0"}}training
area{{color id="-1"}}. Is there no way to get it opened
back up for us?

---
label: talk1016_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Even as we speak, {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}} is
being attacked by {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}}!

If we were able to train at the {{color id="0"}}Southern
Oasis Training Area{{color id="-1"}}, we'd be prepared to
quickly cross the desert and help...

label: talk1016_3

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You may not have noticed, but I already
sent reinforcements to {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.

On top of that, I understand that {{color id="0"}}Lady{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Riju{{color id="-1"}} herself is heading there as well.
There's nothing for us to worry about.

Training area?

I should go.

label: talk1016_1

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Oh, would you give it a rest, Sudrey!


I told you before—so long as the {{color id="0"}}sand
shroud{{color id="-1"}} is around, we can't open up the
training area!

---
label: talk1014_0

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm? {{delay8}}Oh, you're the voe that the chief
has allowed inside the town walls.

label: talk1023_0

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're interested in the training area,
you must be looking to refine your
abilities, huh?
Well, the {{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis Training Area{{color id="-1"}} is
where we've been working to improve our
desert {{color id="0"}}mobility{{color id="-1"}}.
Physical strength is important in fighting,
of course, but being able to easily
navigate the desert is valuable too.
In fact, I'd argue that maneuverability is
the most important part of surviving in
the desert!

label: talk1009_0

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}If you really think that, then we need to
reopen the training area and get to work
right away!

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}I already said no, Sudrey!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}If we underestimate how dangerous the
desert is, we'll never live long enough
to master it.
Going out and training in the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}
would just be throwing your life away.

Until the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} ends, we can't risk
going to the training area. {{delay8}}I won't allow it!{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Captain Teake! Our current training just
isn't enough for us to defeat the enemy!

We need to be training at the {{color id="0"}}Southern
Oasis Training Area{{color id="-1"}}. It's the only way
to win!
If we improve our desert {{color id="0"}}mobility{{color id="-1"}},
those monsters won't stand a chance
against us...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can't worry about the training area
right now... Better to focus on the battle
at hand!
Phew.{{delay8}} Stay calm, Sudrey. {{delay8}}Stay focused.
Trust Lady Riju!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I hear you performed well! Where did you
learn to fight?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I ask you this because that battle
reinforced my belief that we need
to train even harder.
But...{{delay8}}the captain is right. Acting on my
impatience—my desire to do something to
help—would do more harm than good.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}However!{{delay8}} Once the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} clears
up, I'll be hounding Captain Teake to
reopen the {{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis Training Area{{color id="-1"}}!
