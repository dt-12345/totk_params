{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Not only is this your first use of {{color id="0"}}Snowfield

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}If you're going to {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}, I advise
making sure you're properly prepared.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Ever since those ominous clouds
appeared over the Hebra Mountains,
{{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} has been in a bad way.
An intense blizzard has brought all their

food and supplies to get by...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Rito Village is to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}} of here. You'll

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}What's this world coming to?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Time was, you looked at the sky in the
day, you'd see the sun and some clouds—{{delay8}}
and at night, the moon and stars.
But nowadays,{{delay8}} you look up and see
floating islands and ships and all sorts
of strange things...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It's hard to look to the future with

leave our garland alone?!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}You can only get those in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}}, so they're pretty rare. That
means no funny business!
You got that?{{delay8}} I don't want to see you

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Argh, not again!{{delay8}} Didn't I ask you not to
do anything to our garland?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If you want to get your hands on one of

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}If you go faaar to the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}, you

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Between you and me...{{delay8}}those are sketches

Or so they say, at least.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Aha! {{delay8}}So you're still interested in those
sketches, I see.{{delay8}}

---
label: CheckPicture_02

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I can't blame you. It's not as though you

every day.

---
label: CheckPicture_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}This beast is all anyone at the Stable
Association can talk about lately. I have
doubts about any of this, but...
I've heard rumors that Princess Zelda was
seen with this creature. It's a strange
beast too—one that devours solid rock.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}When these sorts of stories spread, they
do tend to get embellished, I suppose.{{pageBreak}}It's already such a dubious tale, I'm trying
not to spread it too much more myself.
With this particular exception.

---
label: CheckPicture_03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Word is that Princess Zelda was seen
with that beast, and that it can devour
solid rock.{{pageBreak}}The farther {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} you go, the more tales
you'll hear about the creature.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So I'd suggest that you {{color id="0"}}visit stables in
the south{{color id="-1"}} if you want to know if these are
just rumors...{{delay8}}or something more.

---
label: CheckPicture_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Curiously...{{delay8}}the farther {{color id="0"}}to the south{{color id="-1"}} you
go, the more rumors about the beast
you'll hear.
Who knows, maybe if ask around at {{color id="0"}}the
stables down south{{color id="-1"}}, you might get closer
to the truth.

---
label: Com_Photo_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}I've been putting a lot of thought into
what might be a good painting to pair
with that frame.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}And I've finally made my decision. I want
a picture of the {{color id="0"}}giant bird{{color id="-1"}} with wings
spread wide in the Hebra Mountains.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Tell me,{{delay8}} have you seen the {{color id="0"}}lone cedar
tree {{color id="-1"}}growing on Talonto Peak, the
southernmost Hebra Mountain?
If you {{color id="0"}}look to the northwest {{color id="-1"}}from that
tree on a clear day, you can see the form
of a {{color id="0"}}giant bird {{color id="-1"}}on the mountainside.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've never seen the real thing though.
I'd go if I could...{{delay15}}but there's no way I can
leave the stable unattended.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But how magnificent it must be! {{delay15}}Thinking
of that giant bird stretching its wings in
the Hebra Mountains gives me chills.
How I wish I could put its likeness on
the wall! Even copying it from a {{color id="0"}}decent
picture{{color id="-1"}} would be enough for me...

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Could it be?!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Do you really have a picture of the
{{color id="0"}}giant bird {{color id="-1"}}spreading its wings in the
Hebra Mountains?!

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I want to paint and frame{{color id="0"}} a picture of the
giant bird{{color id="-1"}} with its wings stretched wide
in the Hebra Mountains.
There's a {{color id="0"}}lone cedar tree {{color id="-1"}}growing on
Talonto Peak, the southernmost Hebra
Mountain peak.
If you {{color id="0"}}look to the northwest {{color id="-1"}}from that
tree on a clear day, you can see the form
of a {{color id="0"}}giant bird {{color id="-1"}}on the mountainside.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If we could decorate our space with a
painting like that, our stable would be
the toast of Tabantha.

label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I want to fill this frame with a painting of
the {{color id="0"}}giant bird{{color id="-1"}} spreading its wings in the

I think it would be the perfect symbol for
our stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Could it be?!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}You have a picture of the {{color id="0"}}giant bird {{color id="-1"}}with
its wings spread wide in the mountains?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}How I wish someone would look upon that
giant bird in my place and draw a {{color id="0"}}detailed

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If you have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the giant bird{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}How spectacular!{{delay8}} You could search the
world and never find a more perfect
painting for our stable.
This is tremendous. Thank you!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But if you have {{color id="0"}}a picture you prefer of the
giant bird{{color id="-1"}}, its wings outstretched under
a clear Hebra sky...
I'll happily paint a copy and hang it here.
So if you ever want to change what's in
the frame, simply bring me a new picture.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It'll get as warm a welcome as any guest!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Quite a sight, isn't it? {{delay15}}The land really
does look like a giant bird with its
wings outstretched.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It's hard not to marvel at the artistry of
nature in the face of such majesty.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Thanks to you, our stable finally has a
symbol to call its own!{{delay15}} And what a lovely
scene it is. It never fails to captivate me.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}When I look at this picture, I start to feel
like I myself have become a bird, flying
across the endless sky.{{delay8}}
Caw! Caw! ...By which I mean thank you
so much!

---
label: Com_Photo_12

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} did you have thoughts on our

much for going to the trouble of bringing
it back here...
But {{color id="0"}}Harlow {{color id="-1"}}was the one looking after that
horse, so would you mind bringing it to
her? She should be around back.
