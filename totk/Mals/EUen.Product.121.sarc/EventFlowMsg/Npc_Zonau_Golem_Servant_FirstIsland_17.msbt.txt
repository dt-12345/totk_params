{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}That is excellent news. {{delay15}}The cold can be

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The primary safeguards used by our
creators were {{color id="0"}}meals that warmed them{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}These meals were typically prepared using
ingredients with {{color id="0"}}warm-sounding{{color id="-1"}} names.{{delay8}}
Any such ingredients will suffice.{{pageBreak}}Some also wore thick clothes or warmed
themselves by a fire. {{delay8}}These solutions were
effective but less accessible.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be mindful of your ingredients when
cooking. {{delay8}}My understanding is that only
one cooking effect can apply per meal.{{pageBreak}}You must take care not to eat something
with a different effect afterward. {{delay8}}The chill
will set in again sooner than you expect.
