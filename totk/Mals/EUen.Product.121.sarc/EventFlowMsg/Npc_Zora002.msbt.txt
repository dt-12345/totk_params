What now?

---
label: talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}I tried washing off the sludge using some
splash fruit...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}But now I'm feeling bitter over the fact
that I used it all up before I could wash
the sludge from that statue.

---
label: talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I think it was a wonderful idea to attack it
with some splash fruit from a distance.

But there's just one small thing you may
have neglected to consider, Cleff...

The sludge was too far away, {{delay8}}and you
were a tad hesitant, {{delay8}}and your hands were
shaking, {{delay8}}and you closed your eyes, {{delay8}}and...

---
label: talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}That is quite enough! I get the idea...

---
label: talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}*siiigh* To think we used up all of the
splash fruit, and yet there is still sludge
on that statue.
My apologies, but I do not think I will be
able to sell more splash fruit for a while.

---
label: talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}You really were trying your best!


It's just that you weren't very confident,
and so you wasted a bunch and messed it
up again and again by rushing too much.

---
label: talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Maybe we could just move past it
now...{{delay8}} Please?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise"}}Hm?{{delay15}} The shop?

---
label: talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Who would have thought you would be so
kind as to wash away the sludge marring
our beloved statue!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Still, I cannot help but mourn {{delay15}}over the fact
that I will likely never manage to get
splash fruit back in my shop.

---
label: talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}To be fair, you used up all of the
splash fruit trying to clean up the
sludge in the square.
You were too careful and had trouble
hitting the sludge, so you probably
wasted about half of them.
Lady Yona was so sweet to have
comforted you, Cleff.

---
label: talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}Indeed... {{delay15}}It is Lady Yona's kindness alone
that brings me some semblance of peace.

---
label: talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Lady Yona is so very kind. She did all she
could to comfort me after I realized I had
used up all of the splash fruit in my shop.

---
label: talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise"}}Hm? {{delay15}}My shop?


Oh, please accept my apologies.{{delay15}} I must
ask that you wait a bit longer for us
to open.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You see, I am currently dealing with
ripples of regret over using up all of

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You see...{{delay8}} I met a bright-eyed crab right
around the time all of that nonsense with
the sludge came to an end.
I was unable to stock any fish because
of the damage caused by the sludge...{{delay8}}
and then it appeared.
It was a single, glorious crab. It crossed
my path while I was fussing and fuming.{{delay8}}
I was irritated.{{delay8}} I was famished. {{delay8}}And so...
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I swallowed it whole!{{size value="100"}}
