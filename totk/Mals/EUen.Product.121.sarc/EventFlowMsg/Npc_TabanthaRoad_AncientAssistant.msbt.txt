{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ah! Look at us, meeting again here!{{pageBreak}}After waiting at Snowfield Stable, the
blizzard stopped, so I was finally able
to continue my ruins investigation.
This area has not only ruins but a chasm
too! It's the sort of place that's really
exciting for our survey team!

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}You want to know something?


I came here specifically because I heard
the {{color id="0"}}Thyphlo Ruins {{color id="-1"}}investigation needed a
helping hand.
But when I go inside, what happens?
I'm attacked by automatons!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I couldn't even begin to guess at the
origin or purpose of those things.

It's just sad, because I was so ready to
study an amazing Zonai ruin, and now I
have to turn around and leave.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Although... There is another ruin nearby. Maybe I'll
check that out and try coming back later.{{size value="100"}}

label: StartPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I came all the way to the {{color id="0"}}Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}},
and then...{{delay15}}and then...{{delay15}}what on earth were
those terrifying machines?
Whatever they were, they really did not
want me around.

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}With such a high concentration of {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
one almost has to wonder if there's a
{{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}inside... {{delay8}}Hm?

---
label: GoalPoint_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I take it you're interested in the ruins?{{delay15}}
That's rare for someone who's not in the
Zonai Survey Team.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But never fear! In the name of public
edification and whatnot, why don't I tell
you what's written on the monolith?
It says {{color id="0"}}the dragon ring slumbers in the
depths of the{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}the...{{delay15}}

...{{delay15}}


{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Shoot.{{delay15}} How did the rest of it go?{{delay8}} I remember there
was a "shall" in there...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}Sorry. I guess I forgot.


There is a full translation in the {{color id="0"}}research
log {{color id="-1"}}over there, if you want to read that!{{size value="80"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Meanwhile, I'd better start traveling {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}
to the {{color id="0"}}Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}}... With all the {{color id="0"}}gloom {{color id="-1"}}here,
I can't risk going inside...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're not trying to go into the ruins,
are you?

I really wouldn't recommend it. There's so
much {{color id="0"}}gloom {{color id="-1"}}inside! It's toxic. And that
means there's likely a {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}in there.
So just...turn around and go home, OK?
If you're curious about our findings, you
can read the {{color id="0"}}research log {{color id="-1"}}over there.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I was just about to leave myself. I think
I'll try to investigate the {{color id="0"}}Thyphlo Ruins {{color id="-1"}}in
the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey! It looks like we're both stuck here
while we wait out the rain.

So we might as well talk, right? Do you
like ruins?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I think it's so interesting that there are
two different kinds of ruins.

Some of them—{{delay8}}the ones that were here
since before the Upheaval—{{delay8}}appear to be
more recent.
Not to say they're not old. They are!


{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But from what we can tell, they're not
quite as ancient as the ruins that fell from
the sky.
On close inspection, you'll see the two
kinds have {{color id="0"}}distinct designs and materials{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Anyway, that's enough out of me. Can you
tell I work for the Zonai Survey Team?


---
label: RainPoint_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All those Zonai ruins that were here
before the Upheaval...

Ancient as they are, it seems the ruins
that fell from the sky are even older!

You can tell because the design and
materials of the two types of ruins are
distinctly different.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}What do you think about that? Did you
learn something?

---
label: RainPoint_02

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Investigating ruins can't proceed in
conditions like this.

When it's time to rest...{{delay8}}rest.{{delay15}} When it's
time to work...{{delay8}}work.{{delay15}} That's the only way
the Zonai Survey Team can be its best.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Finally, someone I can talk to.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}But before we do that, let's relocate to
somewhere dry, shall we?

label: RainRun_01

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}There's no way I can investigate in
weather like this.{{delay15}} I have to get
somewhere dry.

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Can I complain to you about something?


I wanted to investigate the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} on the
{{color id="0"}}other side of this peak{{color id="-1"}}.

But there's so much {{color id="0"}}gloom {{color id="-1"}}coming out,
I can't go near it!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Even the tiniest speck of {{color id="0"}}gloom {{color id="-1"}}on your
skin can make you sick.

So I guess I have to just...give up.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Want to hear something interesting?


The sky ruins are said to contain
relics from...{{delay15}}the age of legends.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Haha! {{delay8}}Can you imagine how much we'd
learn from just one of those relics?

If I find one, then KA-BOING! I'll shoot
straight up to the rank of assistant leader!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh? {{delay15}}How will I get up there?


Don't you worry about that. {{delay8}}I'll work out
the details as I go.

---
label: GoRange_02_2

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The sky ruins appear to be from the age

Which means there are likely relics from
that era...somewhere up there! I just have
to find them!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Huh?{{delay15}} How will I get up there? Really a
details guy, aren't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Let me dream for a second! Yeesh!

label: GoRange_03

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Guess what! You know all those {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}
that appeared after the Upheaval?

There's one right near us, just {{color id="0"}}north of
the snowfield{{color id="-1"}}!

No one's investigated it yet, since there's
a {{color id="0"}}giant monster{{color id="-1"}} with {{color id="0"}}three heads{{color id="-1"}} prowling
around it.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}Which means I've got an opening! I can
go solve the mystery of the geoglyph
before anyone else!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Huh?{{delay15}} How will I get past the monster?


{{anim type="Think_00"}}Eh... Don't worry about that. {{delay15}}I'll work out
the details as I go.

label: GoRange_03_2

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph north of the snowfield{{color id="-1"}}!


I'm going to be the first to investigate it.
I just have to watch out for the {{color id="0"}}giant
monster {{color id="-1"}}with {{color id="0"}}three heads{{color id="-1"}}.
But this means I've got an opening! I can
go solve the mystery of the geoglyphs
before anyone else!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh?{{delay15}} How will I beat the monster?{{delay15}}
Don't worry about it!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'll figure it out when I get there.

Have you ever been?


{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The site is huge, and its investigation
is badly understaffed, so I'm going to go
and help out.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}With the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} that was installed
there, it's clear that ruin will become a
major project for the survey team...
Which means if I do well there, I could get
promoted to assistant leader!

purpose?{{delay15}} I'm going to go up there and

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I really can't investigate...anything.

And I can't get near the {{color id="0"}}Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}So there's not much I can do, other than
