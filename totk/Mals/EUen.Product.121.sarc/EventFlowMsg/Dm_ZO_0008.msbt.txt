{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Link!{{delay15}} My dearest friend! Is there anything

Ask me whatever your heart desires, and I

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah!{{delay8}} If it isn't the Zora armor!


That armor really is perfect on you,
my friend!{{delay15}} I am sure it will aid you in
your search for Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoAizuchi_00"}}Speaking of the lost princess...{{delay8}} It is
possible that something I know may
be of use to you.
If you have something you would like to
ask me about, do not hesitate to let
me know!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I have tasked the historian Jiahto with
investigating the ruin fragments and any
history books regarding the sky.
If you believe that Princess Zelda's
whereabouts are related to the floating
islands or the ruins, speak with him.
I believe Jiahto is currently conducting
his investigation at {{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}, which is
northwest of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}This is truly a burden...


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I'm using my ability to manipulate
water to separate the clean water
from the sludge.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}If I cease, the dirty water will flow into the
domain and cause everyone to suffer.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoClench_00"}}That is why I cannot leave this place,

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Embarrassed_01"}}Lady Yona? She is...{{delay15}}my dearest childhood
companion. And much more. {{delay15}}She is also
my fiancée. My intended. My bride-to-be.
There was a time when we saw each other
often, but life got in the way, as it does.
Time has certainly gotten away from us.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I recall our childhood days with utmost
fondness, and at last, she has come to
visit for the first time in a while. And yet...
I must admit I have been a tad awkward
around her. Due to the situation at hand,
we have barely spoken since she arrived.
She has been an immense help in easing
our struggle here.{{delay8}} I am so grateful for
her kindness.

Have you, perchance, been to the

just over yonder?
Purah asked me to allow her to build it in
order to create a map. Naturally, I did not
hesitate to allow it.

label: DuringResearchShidoTalk_25

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I do not quite understand how she plans
to use it to create a map, but...I am sure
she knows what she is doing.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoAizuchi_00"}}The mountains around here are
dangerous, so it would be most
useful for you to have a map.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}So...{{delay15}} The stone slate Jiahto was
researching had that written on it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The {{color id="0"}}mark of the king{{color id="-1"}}, eh... I am sorry,
but I have no idea what that could be.

As Jiahto often tells me, when in doubt,
ask my father. He is not the beloved Zora
king for nothing, after all.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}He left the domain to investigate the
sludge. That is all I know.{{delay8}} I am hopeful
that he will return soon.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Perhaps you could try visiting the
{{color id="0"}}throne room{{color id="-1"}}. As you may recall,
it is in the center of the domain.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}It is filthy, that much is certain.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}With my ability to manipulate water,
I have been separating the clean water

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}If I cease what I am doing, the filthy water

a monster?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}And that Princess Zelda unleashed it upon
him? {{delay15}}What could that possibly mean?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Well, for now I fear all we can do is take
my father at his word and try not to let
our concern overcome us.
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Link, {{delay15}}thank you for telling me about
my father.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Princess Zelda descending from the sky,
not to mention the monster and that filthy
sludge...{{delay8}} It seems our course is skyward.
We now know that the mark of the king{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
written of on the slate refers to my
father's scale.
The only remaining mystery is that of the
