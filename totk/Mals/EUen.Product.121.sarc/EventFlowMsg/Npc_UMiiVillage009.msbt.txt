There's been a lot of strange happenings
lately. Things falling down from the sky
right onto the construction site.
Hudson has turned into quite
the inventor.

Best I can tell, he takes what falls out of
the sky and experiments until he makes
something new.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The railcar is a perfect example. It's so

or whatever. I was there when Mattison
said her goodbyes.
As a father, seeing her leave hit me right
in the parental feelings.

I started thinking it's about time I
did honest work. For my daughter
Hunnie's sake.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}It has nothing to do with Hudson finding
out I was charging a fee and getting mad.
