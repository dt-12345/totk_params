label: Talk54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Remember how I tried to make a fish pie?

---
label: Talk55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I used {{color id="0"}}Tabantha wheat{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}goat butter{{color id="-1"}}
as the basis for the dough.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}It turns out you can make all sorts of pies
depending on what you add to that!{{pageBreak}}If you add fruit and cane sugar, you'll
make a {{color id="0"}}fruit pie{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}Meat and rock salt make
a {{color id="0"}}meat pie{{color id="-1"}}. You get the idea!

---
label: Talk56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If you add {{color id="0"}}goat butter{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}Tabantha wheat{{color id="-1"}}
and {{color id="0"}}cane sugar{{color id="-1"}}, {{delay8}}you can bake a cake.{{pageBreak}}If you mix in a tree nut on top, you get
a {{color id="0"}}nutcake{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}Or you could use a carrot
instead for a {{color id="0"}}carrot cake{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You should definitely try out some of this
stuff for yourself!

label: Talk58

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sure. {{delay8}}Next time it is!
