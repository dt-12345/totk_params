{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I know that smell... {{delay8}}*sniff* *sniff* {{delay8}}You're
a treasure hunter, aren't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You probably think you'll strike it rich
searching the debris—{{delay8}}the "Zonai ruins"—{{delay8}}
from the Upheaval.
I used to be like you. I was going to shake
all the treasure loose from those ruins and
get my one-in-a-million score!
...{{delay15}}So I thought.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And you know what happened?{{delay15}}


The {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team {{color id="-1"}}crowded me out.
They went and claimed all the best ruins
for themselves.
And {{color id="0"}}Cece {{color id="-1"}}and her smartly dressed
sycophants, they took up the hunt for
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In short? It's over. The bones are picked
clean. You'd be better off just going to
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}in the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
That's what I'm going to do—kick back on
the beach and try to enjoy retirement.

label: Greeting

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What is it?{{delay15}} Are you heading to {{color id="0"}}Lurelin
Village {{color id="-1"}}too?

---
label: Greeting_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What is it?{{delay15}} You take an interest in
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Greeting_00
---
So. Not going to let bad weather come
between you and what you want.

Trust me, I was a treasure hunter. I get it.

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But no one can get into Lurelin right now
because of what's happening there.

They say it's been {{color id="0"}}attacked by pirates{{color id="-1"}}.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Then again, news travels slow. For all I
know someone might have fought 'em all
off by now.

---
label: StartPoint_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Pirates took over Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}, I heard,
so no one can get in.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But you never know!{{delay15}} Maybe that's
old news.

It could be somebody's already sent
them packing. Wouldn't that be nice?

---
label: StartPoint_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now, it sounds like Lurelin Village was
raided by pirates.

From what I heard, it's in no shape to
welcome tourists.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But you never know—I've been on the
road a while. Maybe they rebuilt it by now.

---
label: StartPoint_05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}was{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}raided by pirates.
From what I heard, it's still looking
banged up.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But hey!{{delay15}} You never know.


Maybe by the time I get there, they'll have
finished rebuilding it.

---
label: StartPoint_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This is Lurelin Village we're talking about.
Hyrule's number one vacation spot!

I was devastated when I heard the pirates
had gotten to it.

I thought I'd never get back to those
crystalline waters. Who knew they'd
rebuild so quickly?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I hear someone from outside came in
and helped 'em put back the pieces.
They're calling them the "village savior."
I'd sure like to meet that person and
shake their hand.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}is Hyrule's number one
vacation spot. Even the princess herself
used to stay there.
Thank goodness those pirates were
chased out and they could restore it
to its former beauty.

---
label: StartPoint_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, and you might like this.{{delay15}} There's a
brand-new {{color id="0"}}restaurant {{color id="-1"}}in the village.

They'll serve you {{color id="0"}}meals you've never
tried before{{color id="-1"}}.

Sounds like an absolute treasure trove

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, and did you hear?{{delay15}} A new {{color id="0"}}amusement

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, and did you hear? They're offering
a {{color id="0"}}salt spa {{color id="-1"}}at the {{color id="0"}}inn{{color id="-1"}}.

It sounds waaay more relaxing than
hunting treasure all day.

---
label: StartPoint_14

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}On top of that, it sounds like the {{color id="0"}}inn{{color id="-1"}}
added a {{color id="0"}}salt spa {{color id="-1"}}to its selection.

It sounds waaay more relaxing than

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}By the way, did you hear?{{pageBreak}}The{{color id="0"}} Lucky Treasure Shop {{color id="-1"}}was rebuilt, and
the{{color id="0"}} prizes are better than ever{{color id="-1"}}.

Why not give it a spin? {{delay15}}You never know—
might hit the jackpot.

label: StartPoint_16

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Plus, the{{color id="0"}} Lucky Treasure Shop {{color id="-1"}}was

---
label: StartPoint_08

So anyway. That's why I'm thinking of
going and visiting {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.

It may be all the way out on the
{{color id="0"}}southeastern {{color id="-1"}}coast of Hyrule, but it's
worth the trip.

---
label: StartPoint_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So anyway. That's why I'm thinking of
going and visiting {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.

All I gotta do is walk this road.


It may be a long trip, but when I get there,
I know it'll have been worth it.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But this sign says {{color id="0"}}no one's allowed {{color id="-1"}}into
Lurelin Village.

I'd heard some {{color id="0"}}pirates attacked{{color id="-1"}}, but I
didn't realize it was so dire they had to
shut the village down.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Wow. I guess that explains why the
{{color id="0"}}village head {{color id="-1"}}looked so crestfallen when
I passed him on the side road.
The guy was in such rough shape,
I couldn't even talk to him.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This sign... It says {{color id="0"}}no one's allowed {{color id="-1"}}into
Lurelin Village.

I guess those {{color id="0"}}pirates {{color id="-1"}}who attacked are
still hanging around.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That would explain why the {{color id="0"}}village head{{color id="-1"}}
looked so crestfallen when I passed him
on the side road.
The guy was in such rough shape,
I couldn't even talk to him.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But it looks like Lurelin Village still isn't
letting tourists in.

Not what I wanted to hear after that
long journey.

But if those pirates ransacked the village,
there's probably not much to do anyway.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}*sigh* I guess that explains why the{{color id="0"}}
village head {{color id="-1"}}and that {{color id="0"}}carpenter {{color id="-1"}}were so
somber when I passed them on the shore.
Those two looked so pitiful, I couldn't
even get up the nerve to talk to them.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}still{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}isn't taking tourists.


*sigh* All that time I spent getting here,
and now I have to turn back.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}After all, Lurelin Village is Hyrule's
number one vacation spot.

You'd be a fool not to go in. Especially
after you just walked all the way here.

And, well...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I guess that makes me a fool.


It's a beachside resort, and I forgot my
swimsuit...{{delay8}}*sigh* so I have to go back.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}How...how did I forget my swimsuit? {{delay15}}
I walked all the way to {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}},

I guess I'd better start packing...{{delay8}}for the

label: BackRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But...{{color id="0"}}pirates are occupying the village{{color id="-1"}},
so they're not letting anyone in.

I really thought someone would have
gotten rid of them by the time I got there.

But I snuck a peek, and there were still
pirates all over the place.

I arrived.
No such luck.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But...it sounds like Lurelin Village still
isn't taking tourists.

Which makes sense. I snuck a peek, and
the whole village was still in rough shape.

*sigh* Not what I was hoping for after that
long journey.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I walked all the way to the village, and
what did I find?

A whole lotta rubble, that's what. The
pirates really left their mark.

So, I guess it makes sense they're not
taking tourists.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So anyway, I decided to head back
to {{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

At every stable, there's someone who's
reading the newspaper.

I figure that person can tell me when it's
OK to visit {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I get it! {{delay8}}I mean, this is Lurelin Village

Oh, right...{{delay15}} Me.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But only because I forgot to bring
my swimsuit.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I just have to go to {{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable {{color id="-1"}}and
