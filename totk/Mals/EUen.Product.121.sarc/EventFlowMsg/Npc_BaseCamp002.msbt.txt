I want to go on a survey.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Remnants from the Zonai civilization have
started popping up all over...

This calls for the Zonai Survey Team!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Well, it should call for that. But instead,
they've got me hanging out here until
further notice.
I even spent loads of hours memorizing
everything in the Zonai Survey Team
book over there.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Guess the best thing to do now is to stay
on top of the {{color id="0"}}news in each region{{color id="-1"}}, so I'm
even more prepared when the call comes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I finally get accepted into the
Zonai Survey Team, and here I am
languishing in this place.
Guess the best thing to do now is to stay
on top of the {{color id="0"}}news in each region{{color id="-1"}}, so I'm
even more prepared when the call comes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}"Freezing Temperatures Bring Feathery
Shivers to Rito!" The Rito are all over the
newspaper lately.
They live out in the {{color id="0"}}Hebra {{color id="-1"}}region,
if I recall.

It's in the {{color id="0"}}snowfields {{color id="-1"}}of northwest Hyrule.
Some surveyors grouse about going there
because of how cold it is.
{{size value="80"}}When all they need to do is bring proper gear and
supplies for {{color id="0"}}cold resistance{{color id="-1"}}. And go to the Rito
inn to sleep on a luxurious {{color id="0"}}fluffy down bed{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{size value="100"}}*sigh* I know it's important to be on
standby here, but I wish they'd send
me out on a survey already...{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Such magnificent Zonai ruins! Right here
in Lookout Landing—can you believe it?

Wortsworth is handling the research
involved with it.

Which means it must have the super-rare
ancient Hyrulean that hardly anyone
comes across!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This is my first real job with the
Zonai Survey Team, so I'm going
to put in some serious work!

---
label: Talk04
---
How can I be more useful?

---
label: talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you interested in the stone
tablet too?

The letters carved on it are ancient
Hyrulean.

The only person who can decipher them
is a guy named Wortsworth.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But he went to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, talking
about documents he needed there. So
now I'll never know what this thing says...
Truth is, I wanted to go with him...
It would've been a great opportunity
to learn ancient Hyrulean myself.

Kakariko Village?

label: 1003

Goodbye.

label: talk_15

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a Sheikah village southeast of here.


When the Upheaval happened, some big
ring-shaped Zonai ruins fell there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Right now, it's the hottest investigation
spot for the Zonai Survey Team.

I bet if you got a high-enough vantage
point, you'd probably be able to see
those ruins from Lookout Landing.

---
label: talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, I've been told to spend my time
with this thing to see if there are any
other discoveries to be made.
So I guess I should focus on the task
at hand.

---
label: Near_1_4
---
Gotta be thorough here.

---
label: talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}My first job with the Zonai Survey Team is
checking out this valuable stone tablet.

I'm feeling pretty lucky!

---
label: talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wortsworth went back to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.


But I think I might be able to get him to
teach me ancient Hyrulean if I make an
amazing discovery here.
So I have to be really thorough with this!

---
label: talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh, have you never visited there before?{{delay8}}
It's the Sheikah village southeast of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are some pretty-high vantage
points here in Lookout Landing.

If you climb up high, I bet you'd be able
to see the ring-shaped ruins that fell at
Kakariko Village.
If you use the ruins as a landmark, you
should be able to get there without
getting lost.

label: talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I've gotta become Wortsworth's
number one pupil!

---
label: Near_1_5
---
How's the research going?

---
label: Near_1_6
---
I want to be able to read it.

---
label: talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you interested in the ruin too?


The letters carved here are ancient
Hyrulean.

And Wortsworth is the only person who
can decipher them...

Even if it's just this stone tablet, I want
to know what's written on it.

---
label: talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? {{delay8}}Wortsworth told you about it? {{delay8}}The
royal family's daily life, you say!

And there are 12 other stone tablets with
ancient Hyrulean like this one?!

---
label: talk_21
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}And you already found them all?!{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You already found them all?!{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Wait, but then where's my job security?


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You know what. I wouldn't be a professional member
of the survey team if I couldn't lead my own charge.{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Haha, right!


Only an amateur would call it a day just
because we know what the stone tablet
says now.
A PRO investigates that which has already
been investigated in search of sparkly
new discoveries!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll never stop investigating this stone
tablet, oh, no. I'll keep investigating
from dusk till dawn!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You've come back, I see.

---
label: talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wortsworth has already finished
deciphering this stone tablet.

If you're really that interested, perhaps
you ought to search for the other 12?

---
label: talk_19
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Maybe I should hurry and wrap up this investigation
here so I can go look for the remaining 12...

Then I could take a copy of the writing from them
straight to Wortsworth in Kakariko Village and
become his pupil...{{delay15}} Heh heh heh...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk_33
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}They fell from the sky, so there should be some clue
up above, in theory.

I should talk to Harth later...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Finding 12 more stone tablets seems a
tall order.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Hm! {{delay8}}This tablet fell from the sky, so
maybe searching from above is the way
to go!{{delay15}}

---
label: talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Except...{{delay8}}it's not like I have wings like a
Rito. So that makes it challenging...

---
label: talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Maybe someone like the Rito Harth
could help!

---
label: talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I know that the inscriptions of ancient
Hyrulean have all been gathered in
Kakariko Village.
But! A professional investigates that
which has already been investigated in
search of sparkly new discoveries!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll never stop investigating this stone
tablet, oh no. I'll keep investigating from
dusk till dawn!
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Then Wortsworth will recognize my efforts, and I'll
secure my position as his pupil! {{delay15}}Heh heh heh.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I know that the inscriptions of ancient
Hyrulean have been gathered in
Kakariko Village.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But I'm going to keep investigating this
stone tablet further until I discover
something new here.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Then Wortsworth will recognize my
efforts, and I'll secure my position as
his pupil! Heh heh heh.
...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}AH! Did I say that out loud?! {{delay8}}Please keep
this between us...

---
label: talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Right now I've got to keep my eyes on the prize. I
need to focus on this stone tablet right here rather
than wasting my time with rumors.{{size value="100"}}
