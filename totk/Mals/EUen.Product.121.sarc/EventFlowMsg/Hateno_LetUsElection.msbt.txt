It's almost time!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Everything's ready! It's time to get the
election for village mayor started!

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Or it would be, anyway, if not for the rain.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We'll start as soon as the rain lets up,
so come see me then!

---
label: Talk1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'd love to get this election started,
but it's raining too hard right now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We'll start as soon as the rain lets up,
so come see me then!

---
label: Talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now where were we? {{delay8}}Right! It's time
to get the election for village mayor
underway!

---
label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Nice day for an election, don't you think?
Everyone's gathering in the plaza!

---
label: Talk1046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wish it wasn't so cloudy, but we should
be OK. Everyone gather in the plaza!

---
label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And now, without further ado, let's have
each of our candidates for mayor say a
few words!

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Um... Er... Hi. I'm Reede.

---
label: Talk1054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I... {{delay8}}I believe that the heart of our village
is its pastoral culture.{{pageBreak}}We've built a close-knit, self-sufficient
lifestyle here in Hateno, and I don't want
to see us lose that.

---
label: Talk1066
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My plan is to strengthen our community
with new local specialties, starting with
our brand-new Hateno cheese!

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I am the world-renowned Cece, Hyrule's
premier fashion designer. But you knew
that, of course!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Together, we can turn this backwater
village into Hyrule's go-to destination
for all things stylish.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Vegetables don't make the world go
round. It's glamour that rakes in the cash!

---
label: Talk1055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And nobody knows glamour like
me, darlings!

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Fashion comes and goes! Your style is
trendy now, but it'll be over soon, and
then where will we be?!

---
label: Talk1037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Nonsense! It's trends that shape the
world, not the other way around.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Sophie?!

---
label: Talk1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Both of you are just arguing for more of
what you like—not what's best for Hateno!

---
label: Talk1057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}You can't fool me, Cece. You've loved
simple, plain things forever, including
the vegetables of Hateno Village!

---
label: Talk1058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}I know for a fact that you hide in the silo
at night to snack on vegetables!

---
label: Talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Moi?! {{delay8}}Wh...{{delay8}}wherever did you get such
a curious notion?

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And you, Reede! Your secret's out too.
I know why you've been secretly studying
Cece's designs in the shed.

---
label: Talk1059
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You think there's something there you
can use to get the youth to care about
vegetable farming.

---
label: Talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Now who went and told you that?{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Cece... {{delay8}}I can't deny any of it.

---
label: Talk1060
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It should have made me happy that you
came in and livened up the village.

---
label: Talk1028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}No, Reede. It is I who should be ashamed.
My childish pride would not allow me to
admit the truth.

---
label: Talk1061
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The trends and style I made my name on
are built on the foundation of traditional
culture that our forebears worked for.

---
label: Talk1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Please...{{delay8}}forgive me, everyone.

---
label: Talk1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm sorry too.

---
label: Talk1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sophie? I hereby withdraw my candidacy.

---
label: Talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Cece, wait.

---
label: Talk1062
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd be a fool to pretend you're not the
reason our village is flourishing. I don't
want to deny you your due.

---
label: Talk1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Did I hear you say you're working on new
vegetables to attract the youth of today?
That sounds like a Cece-worthy endeavor.

---
label: Talk1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Hehe, There's nothing wrong with asking
if you can help, you know.

label: Talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}People of Hateno!

---
label: Talk1063
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We've come to a decision!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The best way to keep Hateno Village
vibrant is to work together to combine
traditional culture with new ideas!

---
label: Talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sophie and Clavia told me what you did
on our behalf.{{pageBreak}}Thanks to you, Hateno Village is thriving
once more.{{pageBreak}}We ought to reward such fine work, hmm?
Come to Ventest Clothing when you have
a moment.

It's all thanks to you.

label: Talk1047

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I knew, of course, that you'd been in
cahoots with Sophie.{{pageBreak}}But I never dreamed you'd also been
conspiring with Clavia!{{pageBreak}}Still and all, we can call that election
a success.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you remember what we discussed
when you first came here?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}Cece hat {{color id="-1"}}is the latest masterpiece
from the Cece collection!{{pageBreak}}See those luxurious curves...the avant-
garde colorway...{{pageBreak}}Everything about that hat is perfect.
And so I've been saving it to bequeath
to the perfect model.

label: Talk1052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you grasp yet what I'm getting at?{{pageBreak}}It's you that I want to model my {{color id="0"}}Cece hat{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}You, who saved not just Hateno Village,
but also me and Reede.{{pageBreak}}My perfect hat is unsuitable for anyone
else to wear.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And besides, let's not pretend it won't
look absolutely dashing on you.

---
label: Talk1064
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}At least it will once there's room for you
to hold it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is your reward for a very noble effort!
I can't let you leave empty-handed.{{pageBreak}}Ditch something unfashionable, and come
back to me when you're ready.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you prepared to receive the
{{color id="0"}}Cece hat{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}My perfect hat is unsuitable for anyone

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Here we are...

---
label: Talk1048

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now, put on that {{color id="0"}}Cece hat {{color id="-1"}}and lord it
over the whole world!

---
label: Talk1069
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}As for myself... {{delay15}}I've had a long think about
where to take my brand from here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}To begin with, I'll study my {{color id="0"}}collection of
unique goods{{color id="-1"}} designed by our forebears.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}See me if you happen to {{color id="0"}}part ways with
precious apparel{{color id="-1"}} that's too rare to be
purchased.{{pageBreak}}I might have something in my collection
that can serve as a guide!

---
label: Talk1068

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Tidy, hm? {{delay8}}I shall reinvent myself and
open Ventest Clothing anew!{{pageBreak}}Sophie! {{delay15}}There's work to be done, sister!
