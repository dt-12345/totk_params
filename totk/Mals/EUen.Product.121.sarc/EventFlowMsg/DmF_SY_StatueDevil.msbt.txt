...

---
label: 0000
---
Yes, please.

---
label: 0001
---
Thanks, but no.

---
label: 0003
---
Never mind.

---
label: 0004
---
Heart Container.

---
label: 0005
---
Stamina Vessel.

---
label: 0009
---
I've had enough.

---
label: 0010
---
A different container.

---
label: 0011
---
Yes.

---
label: 0012
---
No.

---
label: 0013
---
Tell me more...

---
label: 0015
---
Goodbye.

---
label: 0017
---
Give it back.

---
label: 0018
---
Give me a heart.

---
label: 0019
---
Give me stamina.

---
label: 0020
---
I'm all right for now.

---
label: 0024
---
Ugh...

---
label: 0025
---
You can talk?!

---
label: 0026
---
Have another one.

---
label: 0027
---
I want one back.

---
label: talk01
---
What's the worst that could happen?

---
label: talk04
---
Very interesting choice... Just don't
come crying to me later.

---
label: talk05
---
I know from swindles, boy, and I can
plainly tell that you don't have the
{{color id="0"}}120 rupees{{color id="-1"}} required.

---
label: talk16
---
Then... What are you still doing here?

---
label: talk17
---
You...

---
label: talk18
---
It's simple. I'll give you {{color id="0"}}100 rupees {{color id="-1"}}to
take one of your {{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}} or a{{color id="0"}}
Stamina Vessel {{color id="-1"}}off your hands.
You can have one back for {{color id="0"}}120 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
And if it's not the same one you gave
me, why, I won't tell a soul.
Exchanging a {{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}} for a{{color id="0"}}
Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}}, or vice versa, for only
{{color id="0"}}20 rupees {{color id="-1"}}sounds good, doesn't it?
You must be salivating at the idea, so
let's go ahead and strike our bargain.

---
label: talk20
---
The price to return a {{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}} to
you will be {{color id="0"}}120 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk21
---
I'll gladly pay you {{color id="1"}}{{color id="0"}}100 rupees{{color id="1"}} {{color id="-1"}}for one
of your {{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}}. Is that what
you want?

---
label: talk22
---
The price to return a {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}} to
you will be {{color id="0"}}120 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk23
---
I'll gladly pay you {{color id="1"}}{{color id="0"}}100 rupees{{color id="1"}} {{color id="-1"}}for one
of your {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}}. Is that what
you want?

---
label: talk26
---
I have {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="NpcDemonStatue_UtuwaSum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of your {{color id="0"}}essences {{color id="-1"}}so far.
What now, hmmm?

---
label: talk31
---
Come to tamper with your {{color id="0"}}essence{{color id="-1"}}, yes?

---
label: talk32
---
No, eh? Fa ha ha... If you say so.


Just know that I'm willing to strike a
bargain with anyone who can hear
my voice.

---
label: talk33
---
I still have {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="NpcDemonStatue_UtuwaSum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of your {{color id="0"}}essences{{color id="-1"}}...
Shall I return another {{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}}
to you?

---
label: talk34
---
I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
me more {{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk35
---
I still have {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="NpcDemonStatue_UtuwaSum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of your {{color id="0"}}essences{{color id="-1"}}...
Shall I return another {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}}
to you?

---
label: talk36
---
I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
me more {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk37
---
I don't see how you can reduce your
{{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}} any further.

---
label: talk38
---
I don't see how you can reduce your
{{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}} any further.

---
label: talk39
---
I don't see how you can increase your
{{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}} any further.

---
label: talk40
---
I don't see how you can increase your
{{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}} any further.

---
label: talk41
---
Careful... Give away any more of your
{{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}}, and it could have a
fatal effect on your health.

---
label: talk42
---
Have a care... Give me any more of your
{{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}}, and you may not have
the strength to stand.

---
label: talk43
---
No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
the {{color id="0"}}Heart Containers{{color id="-1"}} you possibly can.

---
label: talk44
---
No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
the {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessels{{color id="-1"}} you possibly can.

---
label: talk45
---
Then the bargain is struck!

---
label: talk47
---
I'm currently without any of your
{{color id="0"}}essences{{color id="-1"}}. Are you in the mood to sell?

---
label: talk52
---
Ahhh... So there are some who still
pay me homage.

---
label: talk53
---
You don't say... You can hear my voice?

---
label: talk54
---
Now, that is a surprise.


What were you praying for? Long life?
Wealth, like so many of your kind?

Whichever it was, you came to the
right place.

---
label: talk57
---
You came to pray, then... You want what
everyone wants. Long life and wealth.

---
label: talk59
---
Hmm...

---
label: talk65
---
My touch is as subtle as ever...


Note how I took that {{color id="0"}}essence {{color id="-1"}}from you
without leaving a mark.

---
label: talk68
---
Which type of {{color id="0"}}essence {{color id="-1"}}will you surrender
to me?

---
label: talk69
---
Which type of {{color id="0"}}essence {{color id="-1"}}shall I grant you?

---
label: talk77
---
A dealer in life and power... That was
me, once.

Alas, my life-for-money bargains didn't
sit well with the Goddess Hylia.

She turned me into this stone statue
long, long ago...

Even then, I continued my bargains as a
statue in a village. Still, the Goddess did
not like what I was doing.
I was banished from the main street to the
outskirts of town, scorned and neglected.
But that was not enough for her.
Again I was sent away. I spent time
trapped in a pond, with only fish for
company. And finally...here.
Perhaps another might have learned a
lesson from this. But I have not.

No, I have only been biding my time for
the moment when someone who can hear
me appears. Someone such as you.
I'm sure we can reach a beneficial
arrangement. I have dealt only with fish
for too long. And fish make terrible deals.

---
label: talk78
---
Hold still, and don't fret. I'll take care of
everything. This won't hurt a bit.

---
label: talk80
---
What's this?


You haven't received even one more
{{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}} or {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}}?

Such a pity... I was eager to help you
with a minor {{color id="0"}}transaction{{color id="-1"}}. But not if you
have nothing to trade.
Consult a {{color id="0"}}Goddess Statue {{color id="-1"}}to improve
yourself, and then return here to pray.

---
label: talk82
---
Fa ha ha...

---
label: talk84
---
Fa ha ha... Did you think I'd
deceived you?

Perish the thought. I hope that ours will
be a long and profitable relationship.

So which will it be?

---
label: talk87
---
A wise choice. Now, remain still.

---
label: talk88
---
You look skeptical. Not to worry.


Money and life are all as one to me.


If you're ready to begin, then first you
must sell me either type of {{color id="0"}}essence {{color id="-1"}}for
{{color id="0"}}100 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
If you want to buy an essence back,
the price rises to {{color id="0"}}120 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

Before you cry foul, know that you may
choose which one I return to you:
a {{color id="0"}}Heart Container{{color id="-1"}} or a {{color id="0"}}Stamina Vessel{{color id="-1"}}.
I'm eager to help tamper with your
essence anytime you want to return
and pray here.

---
label: talk89
---
Now then, shall we strike a bargain?
