{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes, it's a group of volunteers who've

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Purah has given us orders to search
thoroughly around Hyrule Castle.

That's where we last had contact with
Princess Zelda, so it seems the best
starting point in the search.

Well then.{{delay8}} With that information, the

original duty of subduing the monsters.
Of course, if we come across any info
regarding the princess, I will report it
immediately to Purah.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've assembled strategies and pertinent

Hinox are huge, one-eyed beasts. They
