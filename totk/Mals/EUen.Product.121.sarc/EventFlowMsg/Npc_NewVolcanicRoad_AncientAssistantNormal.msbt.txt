{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} It's you! The master of underpants
excellence.{{delay8}} The one who showed us all
how to achieve more, wearing less.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Thanks for your help with all that. What?{{delay8}}
My new outfit?{{pageBreak}}I've always been a stylish person—a
real cutting-edge sort, not to toot my
own horn.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I joined the Zonai Survey Team purely
because I thought their outfit was so
unfashionable that it'd BE fashionable.
But that whole underpants debacle
made me realize I'm not cut out to be
a surveyor of ruins.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}See? I have reinvented myself yet again.
Unfashionable fashion is so last year
anyway. True chic never goes out of style.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Now, I'm looking for a {{color id="0"}}certain thing {{color id="-1"}}near
here that I think would make quite a
fashion statement. So I hope.
I'm also the sole person looking for it,
and that makes me...{{delay15}}the one and only
member of the Fashion Survey Team!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, if it isn't the purveyor of
underpants excellence!

Incredible that Hyrule is so full of paths,
yet ours continue to cross.

Ah, the fashionable life truly is a
rewarding one!

---
label: Greeting_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}At least, that's what I'd like to
tell myself...

---
label: Greeting_02
---
Now, above all else, {{delay8}}I seek the {{color id="0"}}treasures{{color id="-1"}}
hidden across Hyrule by the fashion
pioneer{{color id="0"}} Misko{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}A ruin big enough to crush a bridge...
Which {{color id="0"}}sky island {{color id="-1"}}could it've fallen from?

I have a feeling that sky island might hold
the key to unlocking some of our history's
greatest mysteries...

---
label: StartPoint_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}No, no, no! No more thinking about ruins!


I walked all the way to the {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}
to find legendarily fashionable clothes!
I'm here for {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}, not history!
I intend to use my Zonai Survey Team
skills to find those clothes, and
nothing else!

label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}My eye always ends up wandering toward
ruins or sky islands...

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
Hmm...{{delay15}} I don't know what it is, but
something about those ruins intrigues me.

---
label: GoalPoint_02
---
Those ruins have something inside of
them.{{delay8}} Might it be...{{delay15}}a monster?

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Looks like there's something in those
ruins. It's gnawing at me...{{delay15}}

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Getting clothes wet ruins their fit.{{delay8}} Rain
really is the bane of fashion.

Maybe our underpants outfits that we
formerly wore would endure this weather
far better.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Our regular clothing stayed dry when we
had to wear our underpants uniforms.{{delay8}}
Not a good look, though, was it?

label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Did you know {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} isn't gems
and such? It's {{color id="0"}}fashionable clothes{{color id="-1"}} that
have a legendary look.
I hear Misko hid a piece in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} nearby.
Personally, I suspect it might be in the
cliffs of the {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There should be a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} near here where
{{color id="0"}}treasure{{color id="-1"}} is hidden. {{delay15}}Personally, I believe
it's in the cliffs of the {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}.

label: BackRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Some bandits take jewels, but {{color id="0"}}Misko {{color id="-1"}}took
highly fashionable clothes! One piece of
their treasure is hidden in a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}nearby.
I'm really curious, but I can't see the
{{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}. Please don't tell me it's at the top
of the cliff.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm certain the {{color id="0"}}treasure{{color id="-1"}} is in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}
around here, {{delay8}}but surely it can't be at
the top of the cliff!

---
label: Near_StartPoint_01
---
The bridge...

---
label: Near_GoalPoint_01
---
Is something there?

---
label: Near_RainPoint_01
---
Underpants had their use...

---
label: Near_Rain
---
My clothes will get wet!

---
label: Near_Thunder
---
Take shelter!

---
label: Near_GoRange_01

That cliff is suspicious.

---
label: Near_BackRange_01

Not up the cliff...
