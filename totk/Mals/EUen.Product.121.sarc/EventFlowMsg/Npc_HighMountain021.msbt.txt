How strange...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We found these strange things at the foot
of the Hebra Mountains. {{delay8}}They're oddly
shaped, aren't they?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've done every test I can think of, but I
haven't learned anything. {{delay8}}Not even what
they're made of or what they're for.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}All I know is that they're pretty heavy
and pretty sharp. {{delay8}}It'd probably hurt if
you got hit with one, huh?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Well, I've got all I'm going to get out of
these things. {{delay8}}If you want them for some
reason, they're all yours.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}These things sure are strange, huh?
I can't begin to guess who made them
or for what purpose.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}All I know is that it'd hurt pretty bad if
you got hit by one.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}And they've been falling from the sky!
What is going on in the air up above the
Hebra Mountains?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I don't have any use for these, so they're
yours if you want them.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}How many are you looking for?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You'd like to purchase that, would you?
It'll come to {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
