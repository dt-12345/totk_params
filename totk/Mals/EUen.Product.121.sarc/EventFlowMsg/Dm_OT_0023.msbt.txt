{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Did I...{{delay8}}see what I thought I saw?


Did that thing just...{{delay8}}give you the {{color id="0"}}power{{color id="-1"}}
we've been researching?

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}That's incredible! C-could you give
us a demonstration?

label: Talk_0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Let me see what the {{color id="0"}}text{{color id="-1"}} has to say.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Hold on, um...


"This ability will allow you to {{color id="0"}}commit any
structure you create to memory{{color id="-1"}}.

"Any object committed to memory {{color id="0"}}can be

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I know just what to use it on!{{delay8}}


As luck would have it, {{color id="0"}}both of our vehicles
just broke{{color id="-1"}}, {{delay8}}and we've been struggling to
put them back together again.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The one on the {{color id="0"}}round pedestal {{color id="-1"}}lost
a {{color id="0"}}wheel{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And the one on the {{color id="0"}}square pedestal{{color id="-1"}}
has fallen to pieces.

But I think,{{delay8}} if you put the wheel back onto
{{color id="0"}}the first one{{color id="-1"}}...

You should be able use your power to
{{color id="0"}}repair the second{{color id="-1"}} in no time flat!

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}So come on, let's see it in action!
Fix 'em up quick!

label: Talk_0011

You can start by repairing the one
on the {{color id="0"}}round pedestal{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Please, use your{{color id="0"}} power {{color id="-1"}}to fix our {{color id="0"}}vehicles{{color id="-1"}}!

Power?

Vehicles?

Talk to you later.

label: Talk_0039

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The text claims that power can {{color id="0"}}reproduce{{color id="-1"}}
anything you've built.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And that would mean...{{delay8}}you could fix our
vehicles in the blink of an eye!

---
label: Talk_0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The vehicles we used to get here
are broken.

The vehicle on the {{color id="0"}}round pedestal{{color id="-1"}} is only
missing a {{color id="0"}}wheel{{color id="-1"}}, so it should be a fairly
easy fix...
Conversely, the one on the {{color id="0"}}square
pedestal {{color id="-1"}}was broken to pieces.{{delay8}} It
would take a long time to repair.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But with your power, after you {{color id="0"}}put the
wheel back on the first one{{color id="-1"}}, you should
be able to {{color id="0"}}fix the second{{color id="-1"}} in a blink!

label: Talk_0049

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hang on just a minute! Are you gonna fix
our vehicles for us or not?!

And isn't one special {{color id="0"}}power{{color id="-1"}} enough? How
greedy can you be?! That's so unfai—

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Ahem, excuse me, I lost my
composure there...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}W-we are really in a bind, you know.
Could you please use your {{color id="0"}}power{{color id="-1"}} so
we can go home?

on there, snug as a bug!
