The girl from the stable...

This is ridiculous.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Sure, yeah, we're kinda not wearing the
usual gear here. But we're just following
orders. It's not weird. Not weird at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Still, that girl who works in the stable
took one look at all of us and left. She's
{{color id="0"}}far over there{{color id="-1"}}...and won't come back.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Doesn't she know we're the real deal?
We're the Zonai Survey Team!{{delay15}} This is all
super official. It's not weird.

label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}What are you thinking?! You guys are all
making our research team look like fools!{{delay8}}

I think you DO look weird. So there,
chew on that.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Y-{{delay15}}you're all wrong. {{delay8}}We're following
Princess Zelda's orders...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}How did this happen? I was the last
member of the team to reach this
survey location.
By then, everyone was dressed like this
by order of Princess Zelda. Why would
she give such a strange command?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}So, you're back again,{{delay8}} traveler!


I keep saying this...{{delay8}}but yeah, we're kinda
not wearing the usual gear, but we're just
following orders. Not weird. No way.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Still, that girl who works in the stable took
one look at all of us and left. She's far
over there...and won't come back.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}She's got to know, though, that we're the
real deal! The Zonai Survey Team!{{delay15}} This is
as far from weird as it gets.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh man...{{delay15}} That girl from the stable...


There's no way she'll talk to any of us on
the team if we're dressed like this.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}She'll surely return if you...{{delay15}}just dress like
regular people.

---
label: Near_01
---
She came over here...

---
label: NakedPlayer
---
The underpants method!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Oh, it's you, traveler! Thanks to you, we
could all dress normally again!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Then that girl from the stable came over
to talk to some of us on the survey team.
She knows a LOT {{color id="0"}}about dogs{{color id="-1"}}!
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}There aren't many girls right around my
age in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}. So, yeah, gotta say
it was great to talk.

Lurelin Village?

---
Dog talk, huh?

Goodbye.

label: Talk_12

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That's where I come from. Far, far, far
to the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}} from here.

It's on the sea. Everyone there makes a
living by fishing.

I can't swim. Just don't have the knack
for it. So I didn't bother with all that
fisherman stuff.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Being on the Zonai Survey Team is the
life for me. So I volunteered for action,
and action's what I got!
But I have to say, I heard that {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}
have taken over my village. That...{{delay15}}worries
me. I'm not sure if I can ever go back.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, yes... There's almost nothing better
than {{color id="0"}}talking about dogs{{color id="-1"}} to just make a
person feel happy.

---
label: 0003
---
The pirates are gone.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Are you serious? I'm glad everyone back
home is OK. Whew! What a relief.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The girl at the stable says she likes dogs,
so I started learning about them!

Turns out that when dogs {{color id="0"}}get close{{color id="-1"}} with a
person, they'll {{color id="0"}}find treasure for them{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}What's that?{{delay8}} How do you get close with a
dog? {{delay15}}Well...{{delay15}}love and loyalty, of course!

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}When I return to {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}, I think
I'll try and raise a dog too.

---
label: Talk_14

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're heading out now?{{delay8}} That makes
sense. Nice to get an early start.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're heading out now?{{delay8}} Good thinking.
A little safer these days when the sun's
high in the sky.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're heading out now?{{delay8}} Well, it is
really beautiful around here earlier in
the evening.
Watch where you're going though. Easy
to look at the view and take a bad step!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're heading out now?{{delay8}} Well, I can't
think of many things nicer than traveling
by moonlight.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I just joined the Zonai Survey Team and
thought I'd be investigating ruins. But
researching monsters seems interesting.

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Here you are again! How are your travels
treating you?

I'm still having good talks with that girl
at the stable {{color id="0"}}about dogs{{color id="-1"}}.

{{anim type="Happy_00"}}There aren't many girls right around my
age in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}. So, I gotta say it's
always great to talk.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Who knew I'd get so excited {{color id="0"}}talking
about dogs{{color id="-1"}}.

No one ever seemed to talk about dogs
at all when I lived in {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.
