What a mess...

label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sorry.{{delay15}} You stopped by at a rough time.

---
label: 0001
---
What's the matter?

---
label: 0002
---
Goodbye.

label: Talk_38

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Bye!

label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}That flying monster took the terminal
from the Skyview Tower.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Good grief.{{delay15}} That sticky-clawed terror has
a habit of stealing things.

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I'll never fix the Skyview Tower at
this rate.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I can't fix the Skyview Tower without the
terminal that monster's holding.

---
label: Near_01
---
It flew away...

---
label: Near_03
---
It came back!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That rascal doesn't miss a thing.{{delay8}} If it
notices us, it'll fly away and be more
on guard...

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}If you {{color id="0"}}hide out of view{{color id="-1"}}, it may {{color id="0"}}lower its
guard and come down{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} It's too clever and
quick to rush.

label: Near_02
---
Huh? Where did it go?

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Uh-oh. I've lost sight of the monster...

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This is really bad...{{delay8}} Where in the world
did it go?

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The terminal for this Skyview Tower, the
one that monster stole...

That creature dropped the terminal,
and it fell around here somewhere.
But I lost sight of it!

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The terminal...{{delay8}}must have fallen
somewhere though.{{delay8}} I can't fix this
Skyview Tower without it.

label: Talk_26
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Ah!{{delay15}} The terminal!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Mister, you got the terminal back!{{delay8}} That
flying rascal was the worst.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks!{{delay8}} That really helped me out.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}And to carry such a heavy thing on
your own too.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'd have a hard time moving that
by myself.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Please, mister,{{delay8}} would you maybe move
the terminal over there for me?

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'll repair the terminal once it's in place.{{delay8}}
Sorry to ask for even more help!

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The tower's terminal is too heavy for
me. I just can't move it where it needs
to go.

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Mister! You got the tower's terminal back!

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You really helped me out!{{delay8}} I'll get the
terminal up and running in the Skyview
Tower right away!

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Let's install it in the Skyview Tower.
No time to waste!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}{{size value="125"}}I'll tighten this... And done!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}There! That's not going anywhere,{{delay8}} even if
a monster is real determined.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I couldn't have done it without you!{{delay8}}
I really appreciate it.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You can see Tarrey Town from here.
I wonder how everyone is doing...

---
label: 0003
---
Tarrey Town?

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah,{{delay8}} well, you look busy.{{delay15}} I'm pretty busy
too. I'm off to work at the next site.
Like they say, "Son and done"!

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That's where Hudson Construction is
located—the crew that I work for.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Just over there...{{delay15}} Can you make out all
of the houses?

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The president of our construction
company lives there. He built up that
town from nothing. {{delay8}}Hudson is brilliant!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh,{{delay8}} I can't help looking up to him.{{pageBreak}}I can only hope to be half as important
as Hudson is someday.

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I look up to President Hudson so much.
I can't help it!{{delay15}} I can only hope to be half
as important as him someday.

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You can't see Tarrey Town in this
weather, unfortunately.

---
label: Talk_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But it's over there.{{delay15}} You'd be able to see
it if the weather was nicer.
