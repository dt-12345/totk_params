I smell a story...

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hm. {{delay8}}Hardly a trace of a {{color id="0"}}recipe {{color id="-1"}}remains...{{delay15}}
Just the remnants of half-eaten {{color id="0"}}Hylian
pine cones{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, partner! You're looking good!
Were you also pulled to this place by
the inescapable tug of a story?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm chasing some new chirps and warbles
from my beloved little birds.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}A group of goats is a herd, or a trip, or a
tribe... {{delay8}}Anyway, this stable has been
raising a small herd of {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}}.
Or it was until all those {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}} up
and vanished all of a sudden.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That's not where it stops though. Some
have said that Princess Zelda may also
be involved...

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway. Why don't you talk with {{color id="0"}}Chork{{color id="-1"}},
the {{color id="0"}}guy who was taking care of the
white goats{{color id="-1"}}. I'll look for more clues.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It looks like you caught up with the {{color id="0"}}stable
hand{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Chork{{color id="-1"}} about what happened...

---
label: Talk_0005_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So the white goats were being given a
feed that Princess Zelda created the
recipe for...
It's hard to believe that Princess Zelda
would teach anyone a nonsense recipe.
That doesn't seem like her at all...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Maybe you can learn more about the {{color id="0"}}feed
recipe{{color id="-1"}} from {{color id="0"}}Chork{{color id="-1"}}?

I'm going to poke around and see if I can
turn up any other information.

---
label: Talk_0005_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Chork says the bottle that he kept
Princess Zelda's {{color id="0"}}recipe {{color id="-1"}}in was {{color id="0"}}blown
off somewhere by the wind{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}As a result, the feed he's been giving to
his white goats was made from what he
could remember of the recipe.
I can't believe that Princess Zelda would
teach anyone a nonsense recipe. That
doesn't seem like her at all...
It's important that we find these
white goats...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I think we should also find the {{color id="0"}}recipe{{color id="-1"}}.
That might shine some light on what
exactly Princess Zelda was up to.
I'm going to poke around and see if I can
turn up any other information.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Partner, time for you to get to work!{{delay15}}
There's a big scoop here, I can feel it!

label: Near_0002

Are there other clues?

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner! {{delay8}}I love that you've got the
energy to search for a scoop this early!{{delay15}}
How's it going? You find any leads?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner! How's it going? You find

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner! {{delay8}}You're still tracking down
leads this late? Impressive!{{delay15}} How's it
going? You find anything?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner! {{delay8}}The rain has a nasty habit of

going? You find any leads?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="-1"}}Where have the {{color id="0"}}white goats {{color id="-1"}}gone?{{delay15}}
Why did they escape in the first place?{{delay15}}
And how is {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}involved?{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The more mysteries there are, the brighter
a reporter's spirit burns!

---
label: Talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you still haven't talked to the stable
hand Chork, go and talk to him now!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We've got to solve this mystery!

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Keep up the hard work, partner!{{delay15}} The
answer to this mystery is close! I can
feel it!

---
label: Near_Hearing_1002

Why'd they run away?

---
label: Near_Search_1001
---
Where'd the recipe go?

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, buddy... Have you seen some {{color id="0"}}white
goats{{color id="-1"}} around here?

I'd given those goats all the love and care
in the world, but the other day, they ran
off together.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}They didn't even finish all their food
before they left—the {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine cones{{color id="-1"}}
weren't eaten!
{{size value="80"}}I followed Princess Zelda's recipe perfectly... But
could it have been the feed that drove them off?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}My poor white goats... Where did you run
off to?

And why didn't you finish all your food
from that great recipe? The {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine
cones {{color id="-1"}}weren't even touched...

---
label: 0007
---
Recipe?

---
label: 0008
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah! {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}shared a recipe
when she visited the stable a while back.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's really amazing how much she knows
about animals. I never would've expected
her to be developing healthy feed recipes!
In this case, it's a recipe for a special
kind of feed for white goats. The main
ingredient is fresh {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine cones{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's actually pretty unusual—it requires
you to mix the pine cones in whole. You
don't grind them down or anything!

---
label: Talk_0011_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I didn't want my wonderful white goats to
eat the recipe the princess gave me, so I
put it in a glass bottle...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But a big storm came through one day,
and it blew the bottle off somewhere.

I wasn't able to find it after that, so I've
been making the recipe from memory
since then.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But what would make my {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}} spit
up the {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine cones{{color id="-1"}} and run off
like that?
Did they... Did they really hate Princess
Zelda's recipe that much?

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I just can't believe that someone like
Princess Zelda would make a feed that
the {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}} would hate so much.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}What could have caused them to run away
like that?

---
label: Talk_0501
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Whoa! Those are my {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}} So this
is where they ran off to...

---
label: Talk_0502
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}There, there...{{delay15}} I'm just so glad to see you!
Are you all OK?

---
label: Talk_0503
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And you're the one who found them?{{delay8}}
Thank you! I won't forget this!

---
label: Talk_0504
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}This bottle... {{delay15}}This is what I was using to
keep Princess Zelda's recipe safe!

Let me see it—{{delay15}}I need to check the recipe.

---
label: Talk_0505
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Mm-hmm. Yes...yes...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wait!{{delay15}} Oh...no!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0506
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}"Grind the pine cones into a powder."{{delay15}}
I'm not supposed to use the {{color id="0"}}Hylian
pine cone{{color id="-1"}} whole?!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I should have known something was off.
It did look really hard to eat...

---
label: Talk_0507
---
My poor, sweet goats! They must have
run off because of the awful food I was
making them eat...

---
label: Talk_0508
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm so sorry. {{delay8}}I hurt you all when I thought
I was helping!

It was my fault all along.{{delay8}} I would have run
away too.

---
label: Talk_0509
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I can't believe I doubted the recipe that
Princess Zelda shared with me...

---
label: Talk_0509_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I should have noticed my mistake right
away.{{delay8}} After all, I really do want to take
the best possible care of the goats...
But it's not just about what kind of food
you feed them, right? It's important to
show them you care with all your heart!

---
label: Talk_0510
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I swear that from now on, I will take care
of you all with the same kindness and
compassion that Princess Zelda displays.
That's the best way to show my gratitude
for her sharing the recipe with me.

---
label: Talk_0511
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh, and I really, really can't thank you
enough for finding my white goats. And
the recipe!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}We're going to head back to the stable.{{delay15}}
You take care!

label: Talk_0521

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I saw everything, partner!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A perfect investigation with a happy

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A perfect investigation with a happy
ending!{{delay15}} And all without me even knowing!
{{delay15}}I'd expect nothing less from you.

---
label: Talk_0523
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmmm. Do you think it's a coincidence
that the missing white goats and the lost
recipe were in the same place?
I have another theory...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Maybe the white goats set out to find the
bottle themselves because they couldn't
stand to eat the wrong recipe anymore.
I don't think that's the case,{{delay8}} but it does
make you wonder, doesn't it?

---
label: Talk_0524
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All right! I'm gonna hurry back to HQ and
bring word of this story's conclusion to
our readers!
See ya later, partner! I look forward to
chasing another big scoop with you!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You saved me from a serious problem.{{delay8}}
I can't even find the words to thank you.

From now on, my wonderful {{color id="0"}}white goats{{color id="-1"}}
eat only the best {{color id="0"}}feed{{color id="-1"}}. For sure this time!

---
label: Near_Report_1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I'll never doubt {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} again.
It was awful for me to think she'd harm
my goats in the first place!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Amazing what panic and worry can do to
you. But I'm past it now!

I hope I see {{color id="0"}}Princess{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Zelda {{color id="-1"}}in the future.
I feel like I need to thank her all over
again for giving me this recipe.
