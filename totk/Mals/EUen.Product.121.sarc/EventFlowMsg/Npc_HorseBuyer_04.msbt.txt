label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Say, do you ever feel sleepy? Heavy?
Lethargic? I know I do. But whenever
I start to drag...
I eat a {{color id="0"}}rushroom{{color id="-1"}}!


Just cook up the {{color id="0"}}rushrooms{{color id="-1"}} that grow on
sheer cliffs and, golly, you'll have the
perfect pick-me-up!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}When you need to be {{color id="0"}}light on your feet{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}My body feels so heavy...{{delay15}}is what I'd say if
I didn't just eat a {{color id="0"}}rushroom{{color id="-1"}}!

If you want to be {{color id="0"}}light on your feet{{color id="-1"}}, cook
up one of these honeys and snack away.
Now that's a ruuush!

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Have you passed by any people dressed
like mushrooms on your travels?

It's not weird—it's fashion! There's a
trendy new brand out of {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}
called {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I respect any style that's about promoting
mushrooms with your whole body!

If you're interested, how about visiting
{{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}? The quickest route is to
go {{color id="0"}}east {{color id="-1"}}from the {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Why am I not wearing it, you ask?{{pageBreak}}I'm too busy eating mushrooms to
wear 'em!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Do these rainy days make you feel down?
Dreary? Damp in your very soul? Sounds
like you need...{{delay8}}
a {{color id="0"}}stamella shroom{{color id="-1"}}!


Add it to your dishes to give your cooking
a pop of pep.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This healthy little morsel will give you the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}When it's raining and you're feeling down,
a {{color id="0"}}stamella shroom{{color id="-1"}} will perk you right up!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh?{{delay15}} You sure look down, and a forlorn
face means forlorn feelings aren't far
behind. I know what you need...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}This {{color id="0"}}brightcap{{color id="-1"}}!


A {{color id="0"}}brightcap {{color id="-1"}}won't just brighten up your
cooking, it'll brighten you up too!

have a nibble. You'll feel better in a flash!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Have you heard about one of {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}}'s
specialties, the {{color id="0"}}silent shroom{{color id="-1"}}? 

It's easier to find those sneaky little
mushrooms in the dark. If you manage to
get your hands on one, it's delicious!
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}And—get this—eating one makes you
move more quietly!

Of course, I'd expect nothing less from
something called a {{color id="0"}}silent shroom{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} They're
a must if you're hiding or fleeing at night!

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you eat a dish prepared with {{color id="0"}}silent
shrooms{{color id="-1"}}, you'll barely be able to hear
the sound of your own footsteps.
If you plan to do much fleeing in the
night, a {{color id="0"}}silent shroom{{color id="-1"}} is a must-have!

label: BackRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You there!{{delay8}} You have the gloomy face
of someone who can't find what you're
looking for.
I'll bet you need a {{color id="0"}}brightcap{{color id="-1"}}! If you cook
and eat it, losing things in the dark will
be a thing of the past!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}If you don't want to carry a light, become
the light!

label: BackRange_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you ever feel frail? Feeble? Wilted?{{delay8}}
Even if you don't, an {{color id="0"}}ironshroom{{color id="-1"}} might
be right for you.
Your muscles will bulge!{{delay8}} Your pecs will
swell!{{delay8}} That pesky soft skin will grow as
{{color id="0"}}hard as nails{{color id="-1"}}!
If you've ever thought, "I feel pretty safe
from monsters, except in the whole skin
area," then you need an ironshroom!
