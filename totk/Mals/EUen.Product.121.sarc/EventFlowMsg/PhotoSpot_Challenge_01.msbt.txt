{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link,{{delay8}} has that {{color id="0"}}empty frame {{color id="-1"}}caught
your eye?

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Stable Association has decided we
stable owners should display pictures on
our walls for the enjoyment of our guests.
They've advised us to start by hanging
up frames.

Yep, you'll find frames like this one here
on stable walls all across the land!

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We stable owners are going to be
putting paintings on display for
everyone to enjoy.
The Stable Association figured it'd be a
good idea for us to hang the frames first
to get ready.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oh, well, that's a shame.{{delay8}} Without some
kind of picture for reference, there's no
way I can paint the scene I had in mind.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Speaking of pictures, there's this
researcher at Lookout Landing
named {{color id="0"}}Robbie{{color id="-1"}}.
He was saying he has this thing called a
{{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}. You can point it at scenery and
it makes a picture out of it.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Some folks come up with some pretty
incredible inventions, don't they?

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Link, have you ever heard the word
"{{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}" before?

I hear it's some gadget that can make a
picture out of whatever you point it at.
And it does it lightning fast too! 
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This researcher at {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}
knows all about it. Honestly though,
I'm not sure I believe it exists.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link,{{delay8}} do you still have your eye on
that {{color id="0"}}empty frame{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Can I see it?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Aha!{{delay8}} This is exactly the picture
I asked for!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What a superb picture!{{delay8}} It's exactly what
I was hoping for!

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This would really liven up the look around
here. {{delay8}}Is it OK if I paint a copy?

---
label: 0005
---
Sure.

---
label: 0001
---
Let me pick another.

---
label: 0002
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry, Link.{{delay8}} That's not quite what I
was looking for.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This is a nice picture, yes,{{delay8}} but what I'd
like to hang on the wall is...different.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Appreciate the thought, but...{{delay8}}it's not quite
the imagery I'm going for.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oh no,{{delay8}} that's too bad...

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I see...{{delay8}} Well, if you change your mind,
please come talk to me.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see...{{delay8}}Please show me a picture some
other time, then.

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you!

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Now, just give me a moment to whip up a
reproduction. {{delay8}}Haha, don't worry! I'm quite
good at this, I promise.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I knew it! It's perfect for this stable!{{delay8}}
And it's all thanks to you, Link.

---
label: Talk_38
---
To show my appreciation, I'm giving you
{{color id="0"}}one {{color id="-1"}}Pony Point.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh yes, and please take this too!{{delay8}}
This dish is a stable specialty.

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes, and take this too! It's something a
traveler like you will find handy when
faced with harsh terrain and weather.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have to tell you, {{delay8}}this is the last of the
paintings to go up. With this bit of art,
all the stables have been decorated!
And from what I hear,{{delay8}} it was you who
helped get pictures put on the walls of
the other stables, too, Link.
As a way of saying thanks for all your
help, I'd like to give you a gift from the
Stable Association. Please, take it.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I have this for you too...

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Ah, hold on,{{delay8}} it doesn't seem like you have
room in your pouch.

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I was thinking I'd give you a {{color id="0"}}special dish{{color id="-1"}}
from our stable, but...

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I wanted to give you our stable's most
recommended {{color id="0"}}elixir{{color id="-1"}}. It's especially useful
for travelers...but, well...

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I was thinking of sending five servings
of our stable's own {{color id="0"}}specialty dish{{color id="-1"}} with
you, but...

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I was thinking of giving you a {{color id="0"}}diamond{{color id="-1"}}
from the Stable Association, but...

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I hate not being able to thank you
properly after you've done so much
for us.
I'll give you your gift once you've made
room to carry it. Just come see me when
you're ready.

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, Link.{{delay8}} Are you here to pick up your
reward for helping put pictures in the
stable frames?

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, but...{{delay8}}it looks like your pouch is still
filled to the brim.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Yes, then here it is...a token to show
our thanks.

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm happy to swap the painting in the
frame for a different one. If you have an
image you like, please just let me know!

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, {{delay15}}Link! It looks like you've saved up
some Pony Points!

If you'd like to trade them in{{color id="0"}} for a reward{{color id="-1"}},
please {{color id="0"}}head to the counter{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thank you for a truly splendid picture.{{delay8}}
Please, feel free to use the stable
whenever you want.

---
label: Talk_103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ah, Link.{{pageBreak}}That stunning painting brightened up
the stable the moment it was hung on
the wall.

---
label: Talk_107
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ah, I know how you feel.{{delay8}} That picture,
it's really something... It just stops you
in your tracks, doesn't it?

---
label: Talk_108
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, then.{{delay8}} Sorry for pestering you.
Please enjoy your time at the stable.

---
label: Talk_96
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You want to switch out the picture,
do you? Can I see the new one first?

---
label: Talk_95
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh, you don't want to change it, then?

---
label: Talk_100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I understand.{{delay8}} The painting really is
wonderful. I'm happy to leave it as is.

---
label: Talk_99
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you.{{delay8}} So I'll replace that picture
with this one, then?

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wonderful. Give me a moment to make
a copy.{{delay8}} Don't worry, I'm quick with
the paintbrush!

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Phew...finished!{{delay8}} These pictures of yours
really are extraordinary, Link.

If you capture another one you like,
please don't hesitate to show it to me.
