{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh? {{delay8}}You're...{{delay8}}the customer I saw at
{{color id="0"}}Ventest Clothing{{color id="-1"}}, aren't you?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, from when they were talking
about whether to go through with the
{{color id="0"}}mayoral election {{color id="-1"}}or not.{{pageBreak}}It's become something of a hassle.
They're both so stubborn.{{pageBreak}}I wish they'd clear the air between them
and end this silly quarrel once and for all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But that's a moot point now. {{delay8}}I have
{{color id="0"}}something else on my mind{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}I have to take care of this before the {{color id="0"}}mayoral

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! You don't mind lending me an ear?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I won't mince words. {{delay8}}It's about my
husband, {{delay8}}Reede...{{pageBreak}}That man of mine... {{delay8}}He shuts himself up
{{color id="0"}}in our shed every night{{color id="-1"}}. I don't have the
faintest what he's up to.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}When I ask, he just says "it's a secret,"
and I can't get another peep out of him.{{pageBreak}}I hate the idea of snooping on him. Plus,
I think he'd catch me at it right away.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But I get so worried when I think about
whether whatever he's doing will affect
his chances in the election!

when my husband isn't around and see if
you can figure out what he's doing.{{pageBreak}}I'll {{color id="0"}}pay{{color id="-1"}} you for your troubles, of course.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The only problem I can see is that he
keeps the place locked up tight.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}You'd never fit in through a window, but maybe
you could dig a {{color id="0"}}hole{{color id="-1"}} or something? {{delay8}}Well, you'll
