{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}My, my!{{delay8}} We meet again. How goes your
journey? Wonderfully, I hope?

This is normally where I'd give you a
chance to respond, but I'd like to talk
about me instead.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Once I was a woman without ambition. 
Sure, I had my twin loves of fashion and
travel, but I didn't have drive!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But Cece's designs spoke to me.{{delay8}} They
said, "Meeshy, take those fascinations
and turn them into action!"
Now I'm a changed woman, chasing the
treasures of another inspired fashionista—
the {{color id="0"}}Great Bandit{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}!
And as I search for {{color id="0"}}Misko's collection{{color id="-1"}},
I intend to spread the joy of fashion
everywhere I go. Such is my passion!

Worn anything good lately?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Good evening! {{delay8}}Isn't it just lovely out
tonight? Even the stars are strutting
their stuff!

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm looking for the legendary {{color id="0"}}fashion
items{{color id="-1"}} the bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} left behind.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Rumor has it one of them is in a {{color id="0"}}cave
marked by stone statues{{color id="-1"}}, but I haven't
seen anything of the sort...

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}They say the {{color id="0"}}bandit Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} is
hidden in a cave marked by stone statues.

But I'll confess, I'm starting to have
my doubts.

For I've searched high and low, and I can
find no such place...

---
label: StartPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Still, I must not give up! A fashionista's
heart never falters!

I'll find one of those {{color id="0"}}legendary outfits{{color id="-1"}}.
No—two! And then the fashion world will
finally know my name!

label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm searching for a {{color id="0"}}cave that goes
through Walnot Mountain{{color id="-1"}}. It's said the
thief {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} hid some clothes there.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I must be close, but... {{delay8}}Where's the cave?
I don't see it...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Some of {{color id="0"}}Misko's clothes{{color id="-1"}} are said to be in
a {{color id="0"}}cave going through Walnot Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}

It must be nearby, but...{{delay8}}where?

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Have you heard the rumors?{{delay8}}


It's said the bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} stashed
fabulous fashions in secret locations.

Supposedly, one of them is in a
{{color id="0"}}cave nearby{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}As a fashionista, I'd love to go find it,{{delay8}}
but I can't risk getting this outfit wet...

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}One of Misko's fabled fashion items is
hidden in a {{color id="0"}}cave nearby{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}I was going to go
searching, {{delay8}}but the rain foiled my plans.
I can't risk soiling my clothes! I have a
reputation to consider.

{{anim type="Think_01"}}Still, I'll set out soon. {{delay8}}I'd hate for
someone else to get there first...

---
label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Have you seen a {{color id="0"}}cave with stone statues
out front {{color id="-1"}}nearby? There's supposed to be
some of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure {{color id="-1"}}in there.
I've looked high and low, and still no luck.
In fact, I was just about ready to give up.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But that's when I heard a rumor about
another one of Misko's treasures!{{pageBreak}}They say that beyond {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay8}}
there's a cave running through {{color id="0"}}Walnot
Mountain{{color id="-1"}}! That must be where it's hidden.
So, change of plans—to {{color id="0"}}Hateno {{color id="-1"}}I go!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Rumor has it that Misko hid legendary
clothing in a {{color id="0"}}cave that runs through
Walnot Mountain{{color id="-1"}} near {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.
I was originally trying to find a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}
around here {{color id="0"}}marked by stone statues{{color id="-1"}},
but I'm leaving those ambitions behind.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Next stop, {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The moment I met Cece at Hateno Village,
I was reborn as a fashionista.

That's why I must find whatever clothing
Misko hid in the {{color id="0"}}cave that runs through
Walnot Mountain{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}
So, I'll head to {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village {{color id="-1"}}and set out
from there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A bright future awaits me, I know it! {{delay15}}I just
have to go out and grab it by the frills!

label: GoRange_02_2

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s fabled fashion items, hidden in a
{{color id="0"}}cave within Walnot Mountain{{color id="-1"}}... I have to
find them! I have to!
It's near {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}, so that's where
I'll go!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The rumors say that the bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} hid
legendary clothing in a nearby {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}When I think I might get to see clothes
like that in person, my fashionista heart
starts beating like a drum!
But I have stay focused and find the {{color id="0"}}stone
statues{{color id="-1"}} that {{color id="0"}}mark the cave{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Do you know how to recognize the cave
where Misko's treasure is hidden?

Ding, ding! That's right! The stone statues
outside of it!

---
label: BackRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}If I told you that I knew where to find
some of {{color id="0"}}Misko's fabled fashion items{{color id="-1"}},
would you be interested?
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Ha! I thought as much. Well, listen up.


It's said that some of Misko's treasure
is near {{color id="0"}}Fort Hateno{{color id="-1"}}, hidden in a {{color id="0"}}cave
marked with stone statues{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Hateno Village, famous for the Cece
brand, is where I opened my eyes to the
wonders of fashion. It's serendipity!
I must find that cave. I will! On my honor
as a fashionista, I will get to the bottom
of this rumor!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Near {{color id="0"}}Fort Hateno{{color id="-1"}}, there's a {{color id="0"}}cave marked
by stone statues{{color id="-1"}}. And in this cave rests
a piece of Misko's legendary clothing!
I swear on my wardrobe, I will find that
cave! You'll see!
