{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If I play my cards right, I can start making

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}I call it {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}. That message my

you're dreaming!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But back to the reason I called you here.
It's... Well, you know...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I couldn't have made this without you, so I...{{delay8}}
I wanted you to be the first to have some...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}A-anyway, consider this my thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}As I understand it, {{delay8}}Great-Grandpa worked
with the mayor back then on this {{color id="0"}}Hateno
cheese{{color id="-1"}} to put our village on the map.{{pageBreak}}But it was ahead of its time. {{delay8}}The villagers
rejected it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Having eaten this, {{delay8}}I think they were nuts.{{delay8}}
Now is the time for Hateno cheese to
make a splash in the culinary world!{{pageBreak}}I'm sick of fashion getting all the attention
lately. {{delay8}}It's really eating into our business.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But if anything will bring the customers
in, it's this! {{delay8}}I'd say it's time to do some
renovation around here!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Ta-da! {{delay8}}The {{color id="0"}}Hateno Cheese Shop{{color id="-1"}} is
complete! What do you think?!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}The next step is to get those folks over
at the general store to start stocking it.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That reminds me. {{delay8}}You won't get this offer
anywhere else, but around here, I'll give
you some for fresh milk instead of rupees.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'll make the dream my great-grandpa
gave up on come true, {{delay15}}and this farm will
be busier than ever in the bargain.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}So...{{delay15}}you'll come visit me again, right?{{size value="100"}}
