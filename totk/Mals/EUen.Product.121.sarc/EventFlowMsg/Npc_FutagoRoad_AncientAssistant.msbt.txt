{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Morning.{{delay15}} You're looking bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed, if I may say so.

label: Greeting_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You must have a lot of energy if you can
go all night without any rest.

---
label: Greeting_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What is it?{{delay15}} You sure seem enthusiastic
about something.

label: Greeting_02

Are you headed that way too, buddy?

---
label: Greeting_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You must have a lot of energy, tromping
around in the rain without a care.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="-1"}}To get to {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}}, you'd
usually cross the {{color id="0"}}bridge {{color id="-1"}}here.

I'm sorry to say it's been destroyed.
Something...fell on top of it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are disaster measures in place, but
they're far from perfect. Be extra careful
if you try to cross through there.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}This {{color id="0"}}bridge{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}} has

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}A massive hole—indeed, a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}—has
opened in the {{color id="0"}}outpost{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}.

As if that weren't enough, they say the
area near the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} is filled with this
creepy haze called {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}If you touch that, it's all over! It will sap
your strength in an instant, and leave
you listless...{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}A hole and haze...{{delay15}} If it wasn't part of my
job on the {{color id="0"}}survey team{{color id="-1"}} to investigate
such things, I'd never go near that.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I doubt anyone would willingly approach
the {{color id="0"}}outpost{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}} of here.

It's not just the hole—that huge, creepy
{{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}. The area is also full of that
troubling {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Me on the other hand, I'm exhausted...
Researching the Zonai sure is tiring.{{delay15}}

To tell you the truth, I'd rather crawl into
a soft bed than rest in a place like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}{{color id="-1"}}When you sleep in an {{color id="0"}}inn{{color id="-1"}}'s bed, you wake
up one hundred times more energetic!
Far more refreshed!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'd like to get a good night's sleep in an
{{color id="0"}}inn{{color id="-1"}}'s bed every now and again.

It'd get rid of all my fatigue in one go!

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I was in the mood to really put in some
good work today too.

Of course, that's when the rain would
start pouring. {{delay15}}Maybe it's a sign to stick
to what I'm good at?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'd rather not get done in by lightning, so
I'll just take shelter from the rain and see
how the weather goes.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Ugh, this rain... {{delay8}}What bad luck.{{pageBreak}}It'd be rough if lightning hit, so maybe I'll
just take shelter from the rain and see if
this clears up a little.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You can find {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}} to the
{{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}, but unfortunately the bridge near
there has been destroyed.
What's more, they say it's because of
{{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}that fell from the sky!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}What are the odds? This is such a vast
land, and it fell on the bridge?!

label: GoRange_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You've got to cross a bridge to get to
{{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.
Well, normally.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
The bridge has been destroyed by {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}}
that fell from the sky.

That would have been fine...if it'd been
the ruins of a bridge.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}There are lots of {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell from the
sky scattered around this area.

And there have been strange sightings of
{{color id="0"}}mechanical figures{{color id="-1"}} just kind of hanging
around these {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}}...
Just what are those guys? Be cautious if
you go near any of them.

You should be careful around here.

label: GoRange_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm told that there's a massive, deep
{{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}on the other side of {{color id="0"}}Proxim Bridge{{color id="-1"}}.

From what I hear, it's so deep, it goes all
the way to the depths of the earth.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Well, it's possible that's an exaggeration.
Or is that...{{delay15}}an excavation?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Either way, be careful if you go near that
{{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}. You wouldn't want to fall in!

Careful near there. {{delay15}}If you fall in, that's a

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Looking for {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}}?
I should tell you about something
serious that's happened there.
Some {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} fell from the sky, and they
landed right on top of the {{color id="0"}}bridge{{color id="-1"}} that
crosses to the stable!{{delay15}}
The {{color id="0"}}bridge{{color id="-1"}} has been...destroyed.{{pageBreak}}Disaster measures have been put into
effect near there, but it's not completely
safe,{{delay8}} so be careful.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The {{color id="0"}}bridge{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable {{color id="-1"}}was

been put into effect, but still, be careful
near there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}There are {{color id="0"}}mechanical figures{{color id="-1"}} just hanging
around the {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell from the sky.
Very strange.
Even stranger, they don't seem to get
along with monsters. {{delay8}}They're fighting with
each other all over the place.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If I encounter that, I wonder if I could
figure out some way to get them to finish
each other off?
That'd certainly make my work easier.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I wonder why the {{color id="0"}}mechanical figures {{color id="-1"}}are
at odds with the {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}}

They can't be fighting over food, after all.

---
label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You should stay here, and steer clear of
the {{color id="0"}}outpost ruins{{color id="-1"}} to the{{color id="0"}} west{{color id="-1"}}.

A massive {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}opened up near there,{{delay8}}
and it's apparently so deep, it stretches
into the depths of the earth.
If you fell in, that'd be curtains for you!{{delay15}}
Seriously, you want no part of that.
