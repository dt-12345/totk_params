{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Someone did cross the {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great
Bridge{{color id="-1"}} saying, "I'll bring music and food
to Rito Village!"
I wonder how he's doing now...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I tried to stop him.{{delay8}} I told him the blizzard
was so dangerous, even seasoned
merchants couldn't reach the village.
But he just picked up his {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}}, got on
the wagon he'd prepared on the other
side of the bridge, and left.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I hope he didn't stray from the path and
wind up somewhere strange...

label: Talk01_02

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh no.{{delay15}} That probably isn't going well for
him at all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}He can't get across the bridge that
leads to Rito Village. It's collapsed under
the weight of the snow.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}But he's put himself in danger by taking
the {{color id="0"}}westbound road{{color id="-1"}} out of here. It's often
much too narrow for wagons.
Worse still, the Upheaval created a
{{color id="0"}}wide hole {{color id="-1"}}along the way that'd be very
hard to get past safely...

label: Talk01_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So, your bridge is out because of the
blizzard...{{delay15}}and there's a terrible hole on
the side of the road? 
I should have tried harder to stop him.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder how the guy with the {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}} who
crossed {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}} to bring
music and food to Rito Village is doing.
I hope he's all right.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Driving a wagon on the westbound road
out of here was hard even before all of
this.{{delay8}} I'm worried for that driver.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you have any questions about the area,
you just ask your Auntie Banji!

Just don't expect too much. Out of me,
or the whole region, really.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I mean, what you see is what you get!
We're out here in the western boonies,
so there's not a lot going on.
Anything new you'll hear or find around
here comes from travelers or merchants
coming down that {{color id="0"}}road {{color id="-1"}}there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you need the scoop on the area, just
leave it to Auntie!{{pageBreak}}But please don't expect too much...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I mean, it's a remote western region.
When the Stable Trotters aren't around,
all you can hear is the bleating of goats.
Any news comes from travelers and
peddlers along the {{color id="0"}}road{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Traveling, are we?{{pageBreak}}Just know that once you cross the
{{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}}, the {{color id="0"}}west side of
the canyon{{color id="-1"}} gets rugged. Prep for that!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, just before you came by...{{pageBreak}}someone crossed {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}}
saying, "I want to bring music and food to
Rito Village!"
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I tried to stop him.{{delay8}} I told him the blizzard
was bad around the village and that the
path was dangerous...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But he'd already prepared a wagon on the
other side of the bridge. He hopped on
and away he went.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Between the narrow bridge to the village
and the {{color id="0"}}huge hole{{color id="-1"}} in the ground,{{delay8}} the
{{color id="0"}}western road{{color id="-1"}}'s a tough route for a wagon.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I should have tried harder to hold him
back...{{delay15}} I just hope he and his {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}} make
it to Rito Village safely.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I think it was just before you came by...{{pageBreak}}Someone crossed over {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great
Bridge{{color id="-1"}} saying, "I want to bring music and
food to Rito Village!"
I tried warning him, but his wagon was
already prepped on the other side. He just
hopped on and headed off.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}western road{{color id="-1"}} may lead to Rito Village,
but the narrow bridge and {{color id="0"}}huge hole{{color id="-1"}} make
it a hard route for a wagon.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Maybe if I asked the guy to play us a song
on his {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}} before he left, I could have
stopped him...

The road?

label: Talk05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, most stables and villages are
connected by well-traveled roads.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}From here, you can follow them west
to {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} or east to {{color id="0"}}New Serenne

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You often encounter {{color id="0"}}travelers{{color id="-1"}} on them,
