{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}So those balloon things that fell from the sky are
called {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}...

There's still so much we don't know about them.


But trust my boss, Purah, to take a thing we know so
little about and turn it into something useful. She's
the sharpest person in Hyrule—a creative genius!{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}How odd...{{delay8}} This place was the royal family's
shelter, so they'd probably have a hidden
pathway. {{delay8}}Even so...{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If this place is the royal family's emergency shelter,
then it would make sense for them to have a
secret corridor.
But maybe I miscalculated something...{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_2_2

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So there was a path after all.


I figured if this is the royal family's emergency
shelter, there would be a path that leads to here.

So if you follow it, then...{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_2_6

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I bet it's deteriorated pretty badly in there... Just
strolling on in is probably a bad idea.

Still, I'm dying to know if it leads to where I think
it does.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}That Wortsworth guy is a bigwig with the Zonai
Survey Team...{{delay8}}isn't he? Surprised he came all
the way out here.
Guess that means this {{color id="0"}}stone tablet{{color id="-1"}} is something
worth looking into...

Close call.{{delay8}} I was just about to demolish it.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I won't be letting anyone know I was just about to up
and demo that thing.

I mean, it was in the way. Any longer and I'd have
split it clean in two...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}That bigwig? Wortsworth?{{delay8}} He was looking at the
{{color id="0"}}stone tablet {{color id="-1"}}in the base of this thing before taking
off for {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
It would've been nice if he had just taken this
massive obstruction with him though...

{{anim type="Think_00"}}If it falls down, it'll be dangerous. {{delay8}}Plus, it's in the
way, so I want to demo it.

But that lady from the Zonai Survey Team is standing
watch. {{delay8}}If I mess with it, she'll probably send me
soaring straight into Death Mountain.{{size value="100"}}

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Turns out this giant thing has inscriptions on it that
are valuable to archaeological research... And that
lady from the Zonai Survey Team is right there.
Glad she doesn't know I intended to demolish it.
I mean, it's huge. It takes up so much space...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

I don't want to get wet.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hear it's valuable, so I'm not going to
touch it.

But it looks like it could go toppling over
at any moment, so please be careful.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Whenever it rains, the walls get slick,
which can be dangerous. It's a real pain
for us carpenters.
So be careful, will you?{{delay15}}


Although, it's not like you're going to be
climbing all over the walls or anything, ha.
