{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Aaah! A voe!

label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}L-little Gerudo aren't supposed to talk
to voe!

And I'm a little Gerudo, so that means
I have to stop talking to you now!

label: talk0008

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hey!{{delay15}} My granddaughter still has a lot to
learn before she can talk to a voe.

If you need something, just come talk to
me instead, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey now! Did you completely miss what
I said before?

My granddaughter still has a lot to learn
before she can talk to a voe. How about
leaving her be?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Ah! Eye contact! And the eyes are close
to the mouth, and the mouth is where I'd
be speaking from if I talked to that voe!
I-I-I've got to hurry to the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"
{{color id="0"}}class {{color id="-1"}}so I can ask how to talk to voe!

---
label: talk0027

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}M-m-more eye contact! Ah!


I-I-I've got to hurry to the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"
{{color id="0"}}class {{color id="-1"}}so I can ask how to talk to voe!

I wish they spoke louder...

---
label: talk0011
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's no use. I can't hear anything they're saying
from here.

I just wanted to listen in on the{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}} class{{color id="-1"}}
and learn a bit.

But if I go into the classroom, Ms. Ashai will
definitely see me and kick me out.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I even thought {{color id="0"}}hiding with the voe dummies {{color id="-1"}}in there
would fool her, but my outfit looks different from
theirs, and she spotted me.
Maybe I can find a way to hide in the classroom
without being so obvious?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I really want to listen in on the class and
learn a bit...

Maybe if I try to sneak in and {{color id="0"}}hide with
the voe dummies{{color id="-1"}}, it'll work out better
this time?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I dunno. I'm still not dressed anything
like they are, so I'd probably get
caught again.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I tried {{color id="0"}}hiding with the voe dummies{{color id="-1"}} in the

I wonder what I could do to hide better...

You{{color id="-1"}}" {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}} that my big sister Kalani
is attending!
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I was only able to look in from outside, and
