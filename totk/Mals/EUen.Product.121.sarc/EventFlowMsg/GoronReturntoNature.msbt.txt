So strange...

---
label: Near_02
---
Where was it now?

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The marbled rock roast just up and
vanished...{{delay8}} Sometimes the strangest
things happen.
But the city's bustlin' again, and leavin'
the work at the inn to that younger Goron
means we've got time on our hands now.
Maybe we should take a vacation, eh?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oooh, let's go somewhere we can really
see the moon.

I'm thinkin' about the place we were born,
Tray. 'Member how the {{color id="0"}}full moon shone
on the ground{{color id="-1"}} there?

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}How could I forget? It was quite a sight!
Goin' back there is a great idea.

But what with the lava flows, the area
has gotten confusing to navigate...

I don't remember where it is. I'll follow
you on this one, Volcon.

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Uh-oh... I was countin' on you to
remember how to get there, buddy!

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I vividly remember the {{color id="0"}}full moon shinin'
on the ground{{color id="-1"}}, but nothing aside
from that...

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The city's all hustle and bustle again.
And the inn's all sorted out with that
young Goron.
I was thinkin' we might take a vacation
and spend time round where we were
born. Beautiful moon views and all.
But who woulda thought neither of us
would remember how to get there!

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I was sure you'd be the one to
remember, bud...

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, I do remember the {{color id="0"}}full moon shinin'
on the ground {{color id="-1"}}there...{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

Other than that, I can't recall anything.

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}After retiring from the inn, I was looking
forward to takin' a trip with you at last,
just us buddies.

---
label: 0010
---
Full moon?

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Eavesdroppin', were ya?

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}You again, huh? Are you forgetful too?

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Gorons are born of the land, ya see.


Volcon and I were born from the same 
place, so you could say we're
rock brothers.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We were born in a cave.


But the full moon shone so brightly,
lighting up the darkness of the cave. It
was a mystical thing to see!

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I remember thinkin' it was weird that it
was the {{color id="0"}}middle of the day{{color id="-1"}} and not night. I
was just a baby, but I still remember it!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The only other thing I recall is that it was
somewhere at {{color id="0"}}Lake Ferona {{color id="-1"}}in
{{color id="0"}}Eldin Canyon{{color id="-1"}}... But that's it.

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}My memory is all fuzzy. Volcon, can you
remember anything else?

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's no use... Nothin' is bringin' it to mind.


Maybe if I could see a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} or
something that shows that {{color id="0"}}full moon
shining on the ground{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Speaking of, I heard a researcher at a
place called Lookout Landing invented a
tool to turn scenery into pictures.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Scenery into pictures?! What kinda thing
can do somethin' like that?

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I just heard about it. I've got no clue how
it works.

---
label: 0011
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Here I thought Volcon and I could finally
take a vacation and go moongazing...

But we can't very well get there if neither
of us knows where it is!

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I could just see a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} or something
that shows the way the {{color id="0"}}full moon shines
on the ground {{color id="-1"}}there...
Pretty sure I'd be able to remember
it then.

label: 0012

Take a look at this.

---
label: 0013
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Maybe I'll just stare at a map until I
remember. Or somethin'.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I won't sleep till I remember.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Yes! That's the place!

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey! That's the spot! That's just how the
cave lit up when we were baby Gorons!

That did the trick—I remember how to
get there.

It was on the west side of Lake Ferona!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you, young Hylian. I can remember
it so clearly now!

It was really chappin' my hide, not being
able to remember. I feel relieved to
recall it.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm sure it wasn't easy to find!


Take this as thanks from us.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}No time like the present to take that trip.
Let's get a move on!

Time to buckle down and prepare for
the journey ahead.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sure thing. I just need another decade,
and then I'll be ready.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}That's the Tray I know. Quick as always.


I surely won't be ready for at least
another 15 years, m'self.
