{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}No matter how groggy those monsters

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}It may be the middle of the day, but

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You thinking about going in there alone?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}Anyway, this is the {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}}.
We help keep the peace in Hyrule by

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Anyway, let me introduce myself again...{{delay8}}

so we don't have a way to board it.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}We can give those monsters a real
