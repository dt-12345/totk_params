{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? You're an unfamiliar face...


Are you a member of that {{color id="0"}}caravan squad{{color id="-1"}}
heading to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The road from Kara Kara Bazaar to
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is closed because of
the sand shroud.
You're welcome to help the {{color id="0"}}caravan squad{{color id="-1"}}
guard this place in the meantime though!

Gerudo Town?

---
label: talk0003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is to the southwest of here.
It's the biggest town in the region!

That said, the laws of the Gerudo forbid
voe—men—from entering the town.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Though, voe or not...


under this terrible {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, it would
take a near miracle to reach the town in
the first place.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I recommend you follow the example of
the voe of the {{color id="0"}}caravan squad{{color id="-1"}} and give
up on even trying for now.

Caravan squad?

---
label: talk0004

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're a group of Hylian merchants.


It's not as though they can do business in
this {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, so they're helping out
by guarding the entrance here.
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It's clear their plan is to gain access to
Gerudo Town by getting into our
good graces...{{pageBreak}}But our law about voe is absolute. We
couldn't let them in if we wanted to.

Goodbye.

---
label: talk0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, you're not with them?


Well, nonetheless, the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} is
especially harsh for you Hylians, so you
should stay put.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, in any case, the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} is
particularly harsh for you Hylians, so
you should stay here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Hah! I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, even if you're not with them, you
shouldn't leave here regardless.

label: near0001

They're tough!

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful"}}Our spears are no match for them!
Have they no weaknesses?!

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I had to fire those voe from the caravan
squad who were helping us guard
the oasis.
Those idiots... When the monsters
attacked, they fled into the inn before
even the civilians could.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not all voe are as brave as you, it seems.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I allowed myself to have high hopes, but
the caravan squad really disappointed me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Clearly not all voe possess your courage...

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even with the sand shroud cleared up,
the desert is still a dangerous place full
of monsters.
We must remain vigilant at all costs.
