look so petrified.{{pageBreak}}I'm interested in the roast, which I hear is

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those roasts might make the Gorons
swoon, but it would take more than a
meal to win my heart.
No offense—I just like my voe to have a
little meat on their bones.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm going to try eating another roast at

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Are you eating at the {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}} as well?{{pageBreak}}Well, then. Aren't you going to buy me a
meal? {{delay15}}I'd hate to eat alone...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Ahaha! I'm just joking. Please, no need to

I don't even think I can eat it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're hoping to win my heart,
you won't do it with the roasts they

without a sense of humor, or did you
misplace it somehow?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Anyway, whether or not I'll be wooed by
this food is beside the point. I can hardly
eat it.{{pageBreak}}I can't believe I put off searching for voe
to come here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Look at that shop owner chow down.{{delay15}}
You can tell he loves the stuff.

Me? {{delay15}}I could scarcely make a dent in it.


And to think I put off my search for voe to
eat here. What a mistake that was.

I've had a good, filling meal, I'm going to

I thought I'd have to turn around and

Thankfully, they also serve steaks suitable
