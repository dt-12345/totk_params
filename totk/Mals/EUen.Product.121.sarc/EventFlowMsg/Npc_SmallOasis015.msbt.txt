It won't give an inch...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}I think this is stone, but no matter what I
do, I can't put a dent in it!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}How did something this huge just appear
here out of nowhere?

How many more are there?

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}No matter how many I strike down, more
keep coming... It's as if we're standing
atop a hive!

All's well, shroud aside.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}My heart flutters, even now, to think of
the courage you displayed in that battle.

It is reassuring to see that there is at
least one capable Hylian voe.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}You are quite unlike those members of
the caravan squad.

They were helping us with our guard
duties up until Captain Ripp fired them.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those voe from the caravan squad are
spirited, but that's about all they have
going for them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If only they had true strength like you.


Maybe then, perhaps, Captain Ripp
wouldn't have had to fire them.

Can't let my guard down...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, now that the sand shroud is gone
and our forces are restored, we shouldn't
need to rely on outsiders' help anymore.
