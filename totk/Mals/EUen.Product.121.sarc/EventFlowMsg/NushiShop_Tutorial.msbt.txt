{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And the rumors are TRUE!{{delay8}} There is a
creature in the cave called a {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}},
and it glows just like a Satori.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Gaaaw, but I didn't think it would be
up sooo high on the wall or run about
all nimbly-bimbly like that.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}In that case, Little Brother,{{delay8}} why not get

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}YOU want to hear about MY dream?!{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Wellll, it's simple really. I dream of
becoming a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}}! You know...the
creature of myth!

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I'm happy to tell you over and over and
OVER again! {{delay15}}My dream—my WISH—is to
become a mythical {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}} are legendary creatures that
have been spotted allll over Hyrule.

Piercing eyes...{{delay8}}blueish-white fur...{{delay8}}
Oooh, how I've admired them since
I was a wee Koltin!

---
label: Talk_33_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And then I read these ancient texts and
they told me how to transform myself—{{delay8}}
transform ME, KOLTIN—{{delay8}}into a Satori!{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_33_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}For it to work, I MUST find a {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}}—{{delay8}}
a straaange creature that loves dark caves
and glows blueish-white like a Satori.
Then I have to collect a {{color id="0"}}Bubbul gem{{color id="-1"}},
which is a bauble that {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs{{color id="-1"}} drop
when they're feeling weak.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}That's why I chased after the Bubbulfrog
lurking in the {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}. I wanted to get my
fingers on that gem.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But who knew a Bubbulfrog could gambol
about like that?{{delay15}} So nimbly-bimbly!{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Ngggyaaat!{{delay15}} I want to be a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}}! I WILL

reason for doing such doings.

So if you get hold of a {{color id="0"}}Bubbul gem{{color id="-1"}},
pleeease give it to meee! I'll give you
a treasure in trade, I swear.

{{color id="0"}}goods that make you look like a monster{{color id="-1"}}.
The mask I gave you was made to look
just like a Bokoblin, so much so that even
a Bokoblin would take you for one.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_02"}}By all means, do try it on. Then you will
see what it's like to have the body and
the heart of a Bokoblin!
