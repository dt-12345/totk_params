{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm.


I have seen the Yiga Clan use disguises in
the past, and I am experienced enough to
tell you're not a member of that group.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Beyond the {{color id="0"}}Bridge of Hylia{{color id="-1"}}, you'll find
{{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}a densely wooded region with lots
of old ruins.
It has no shortage of hiding places,
which means the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}} can easily
conceal themselves there.
That's the reason I'm on high alert.
Sorry for suspecting you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Did you know some of their members even
camouflage in trees? The cowards!

If you spot a tree with even one leaf
out of place, stay away. You got that?

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Apparently some members of the
{{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan {{color id="-1"}}can camouflage in trees.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If any foliage strikes you as suspicious,
I advise you stay away from it.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}} are not showing
themselves. Perhaps they know better
than to try confronting me.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}But wait... {{delay8}}No!{{delay8}} How could I forget their
mastery in the evil arts of disguise
and camouflage?
For all I know, they may be hiding in
plain sight, slipping in among crowds
of innocent travelers...
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Sa'oten! I must be ever watchful, lest one
of those tricksters tries to slit my throat!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I fear the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan {{color id="-1"}}are hiding in plain
sight, slipping in among innocent
passersby to evade detection.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}This means I can trust no one I meet...
Even a kind, wrinkly old vai may in fact
be a Yiga assassin in disguise.
I hate to cast undue suspicion on
innocents, but that may simply be
the cost of vigilance.

label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It hardly ever rains in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}, the
place where I was born and raised.

So I admit, sheltering from the rain like
this still feels novel and exciting.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}On a journey, one can have truly new
experiences... {{delay8}}You have to slow down
and enjoy them when they happen.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}They are like oases in the desert, these
moments of simple pleasure.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It seldom rained in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}, so
sheltering from the rain like this still
feels novel and exciting.
I could stay here for ages, listening to
that pitter-patter and never tire of it.

Even after the rain stops, I might never
move from this spot...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Bridge of Hylia{{color id="-1"}} is to the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}}, and
beyond it, densely wooded {{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}}.

That region was already ideal for {{color id="0"}}Yiga
Clan {{color id="-1"}}members seeking places to hide.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}But now, to make the situation there
even worse, I hear that they have started
to disguise themselves as {{color id="0"}}fruit{{color id="-1"}}.
The forest has {{color id="0"}}fruit {{color id="-1"}}everywhere, of
course, so it's bound to be crawling
with Yiga jackals!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}If you come across a suspicious {{color id="0"}}fruit{{color id="-1"}},
be on guard. {{delay8}}It could be a trap.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I hear that some members of the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}}

{{anim type="Greeting"}}Should you come across a fruit that

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I heard a rumor that members of the
{{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}} are hiding out in the {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}
that appeared everywhere.
Without any evidence, I hesitate to
believe such a fantastic claim, but I
can't dismiss it either.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}The question is, why would they choose
to roost in those dank, unlivable places?
Literal holes in the ground?
Perhaps... {{delay8}}Perhaps because no one would
think to look for them there.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}And in the {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}, there would be plenty
of shadows for the cowards to hide in.

label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hiding out in {{color id="0"}}chasms {{color id="-1"}}where no one is
looking—where sunlight doesn't reach—
would be exactly the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}}'s style.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Sadly, we have too little information to
know whether the suspicious figures seen
in the {{color id="0"}}chasms {{color id="-1"}}are Yiga.
For now, we will have to wait and keep
a watchful eye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Bridge of Hylia {{color id="-1"}}lies to the south,
and beyond it, {{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}}.

That region is well known for its densely
wooded forests.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Lately, though, there have been
troubling reports of {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan {{color id="-1"}}members
camouflaging amid the {{color id="0"}}fruit{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Stay on your guard...or one of their

accost travelers on the roads.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}And as if that wasn't enough, they are
also masters of disguise!
