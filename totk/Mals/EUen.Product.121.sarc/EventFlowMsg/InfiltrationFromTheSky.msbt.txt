{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's been a while, so maybe I should go
see how it's going over there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Up ahead, there's a special place just
for Maca!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In the forest, there's a wide, open space,
and right in the middle, there's a
{{color id="0"}}green swirl{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And! You {{color id="0"}}can see an island floating in the
sky{{color id="-1"}} from there! {{delay8}}Maca loves that place.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Bye-bye!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, but since it's covered in lost fog,
only Koroks can go there.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So you can't come with me. But...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll tell you where to find it.{{delay15}} Could you
show me your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's here!

label: talk007

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can see an island floating in the sky
from there. I wonder if you could see into
the forest {{color id="0"}}from that sky island{{color id="-1"}} too...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?!{{delay8}} You're not even a Korok, and you
still got there?! Woooooow!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Isn't it great? It's my secret, even from
the other Koroks. Don't tell!

I'm gonna go check on it since I haven't
visited in a while. See you!
