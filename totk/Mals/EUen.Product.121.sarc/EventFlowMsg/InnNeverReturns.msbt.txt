I love you, hearty truffle...

Oh, come on.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Welcome, friend!


Those eyelids feeling heavy? Then you've
come to the right place!

Pick any bed in this inn, and it's yours
for a paltry{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}10,000 rupees{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}}

label: Talk_0005

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Hahaha! I'm joking! You should have seen
the look on your face. Whew... {{delay15}}Yeah.
I don't even work here.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I stopped by hoping to catch some Zs
when the owner up and asked me to keep
an eye on the place.
He said he had to go make up the beds in
the {{color id="0"}}survey-team tents{{color id="-1"}} and that he'd be
right back, but, uh...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I don't think he's coming back.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I want to look for him, but there are
four {{color id="0"}}tent camps{{color id="-1"}} in this village and only
one me.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Could you maybe track down the {{color id="0"}}owner{{color id="-1"}}
and tell him to come back already?

If you run across some sleepy-looking guy
spacing out, you've found your man.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You're KIDDING me.


You found him sleeping in a tent?! And
you had to wake him up?

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'm, uh...I'm back.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}It's YOU! Took your sweet time!

---
label: Talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}S-sorry, I...got a little sidetracked...

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sidetracked?! You're lucky I don't track
my boot on your backside! {{delay8}}Well, you're
here now, so all is forgiven.

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And that means I don't have to watch the
place anymore! {{delay8}}Thanks for the help, bud.
Here's a little something for your trouble.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh, hearty truffle...{{delay8}} You're the only...
fungus for me.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}My lovely...{{delay8}}hearty truffle... Fungus of my
dreams... Your aroma is unmistakable...{{pageBreak}}You may hide...but my nose knows...

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}*sniff* *snorffff* A gentle aroma with a
strong, hearty undertone...

My dear hearty truffle, I have you now!

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah... {{delay8}}Huh?{{delay15}} Was...was that just a dream?{{delay15}}
And...where am I?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}That's right. I was changing the beds!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, th-thank you for waking me up.{{pageBreak}}I need to hurry back to the inn.{{delay15}} Oooh, that
traveler's going to be so mad at me...

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Sorry, I don't actually work here.


I stopped in for a nap, and right when
I was getting comfy, the owner asked me
to watch the inn for him.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But he still hasn't come back!

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}If you want to stay here, you'll need to
{{color id="0"}}bring back the owner{{color id="-1"}}.

He's pretty easy to recognize—sleepy
guy, spaces out a lot... You'll know him
when you see him.
He said he was going to change the
survey team's beds, so maybe he's in
one of their {{color id="0"}}four places with tents{{color id="-1"}}?

I'M the sleepy one here.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! Um...{{delay15}} Are you a...{{delay8}}customer, perhaps?{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Heyyy, there you are! {{delay8}}Sounds like I've got
you to thank for waking this guy up.

No more watching the inn for me!{{delay8}} Here's
a little something for giving me back my
free time. 

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Aw, man. Looks like your pouch is full.


I was gonna give you a {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}} too.
Never leave home without one!{{delay8}}

Talk to me again once you've got some
room in your pouch!

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well, look who's back!{{delay8}} Did you make
space in your pouch?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Huh. Guess you didn't.


I'm telling ya, this {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}} is a
traveling essential.{{delay8}} Come back when
you've got the room to carry it!

---
label: Talk_0022

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Hey! You make space in your pouch yet?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Huh, you sure haven't. I mean, no rush
or anything, but, uh...{{delay8}}

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I still want to give you that {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}}.
It's good stuff! Come back when you can
actually carry it.

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Hey!{{delay8}} That pouch is looking a whole lot
roomier now.

You're gonna love this stuff.{{delay8}} Here!

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It's a high-quality concoction made of
four sticky frogs and a Bokoblin horn.

Should come in handy on your rainy-day
adventures.

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_00"}}Right then... {{delay8}}Now to finally take that nap.{{delay15}}
I might even splurge on a SOFT bed!
