Huge statues...

---
label: near0000
---
I have no idea...

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I heard there's a place out in the desert
with huge statues that are all facing
each other.
Have any of your customers ever
mentioned seeing something like that
while they're surfing the dunes?

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm...{{delay8}} Hard to say. The desert has its
share of statues and ruins, and of course
the Upheaval really changed things too.
Do you have any more information to go
on? Maybe a {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} or something?

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I did have one,{{delay8}} but the wind caught it and
blew it off to who-knows-where...

I know for sure that it's in the eastern
part of the desert though. {{delay8}}And like I said,
the {{color id="0"}}huge statues{{color id="-1"}} face each other.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}It helps to know it's in the east, but...
Well, the desert is really,{{delay8}} really big.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah! A customer...

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry, I need to get back to work...


If you figure out where you need to go,
come back and see me. {{delay8}}I'll be happy to
rent a sand seal to you for the trip!

---
label: near0008
---
What am I gonna do?

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Hey! You! You look like you've done your
fair share of exploring!

Have you ever seen massive ruins with
{{color id="0"}}huge statues facing each other{{color id="-1"}}? It'd be...
in the eastern part of the desert, I think?
I lost my map, so I don't know exactly
where they are...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Does that sound familiar?{{delay8}} If you know
what I'm talking about, I'd appreciate it if
you could take me there on a {{color id="0"}}sleigh seal{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Exploration expenses were paid in
advance, so I'd obviously reward you if
you helped me!

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'm supposed to investigate ruins in the
eastern part of the desert...

And there are {{color id="0"}}huge statues there that
face one another{{color id="-1"}}. But that's all
I remember.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I lost the map that marked exactly where
the ruins were, so I'm in a tough spot
right now...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you know where these ruins are, I'd
really, really appreciate you giving me a
lift there on a {{color id="0"}}sleigh seal{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I was paid in advance, so I'd obviously
reward you if you helped me!

---
label: 0019
---
I'll take you there!

---
label: 0020
---
I'm sorry...

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq!{{delay8}} In that case, I'll wait for you over
at the east gate.

Come find me once you've got a {{color id="0"}}sleigh
seal{{color id="-1"}} ready to go!

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq!{{delay8}} In that case, I'll wait for you 
right here.

Come and talk to me once you've got a
{{color id="0"}}sleigh seal{{color id="-1"}} ready to go!

---
label: talk0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq!{{delay8}} OK, let's not waste any more time!


Can I go ahead and hop on the sleigh?

---
label: 0024
---
Go ahead!

---
label: 0025
---
Not yet...

---
label: talk0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}All right! Let's get going to those ruins!{{delay15}}
Relatively safely, if possible!

---
label: talk0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}OK, that's no problem. Come talk to me
when you're ready to go, OK?

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}No, no, that's OK.{{delay15}}


It's a minor location that most Gerudo
don't know about, so it'd be silly to
expect a Hylian to be able to take me.

---
label: near0009
---
Quite a wait...

---
label: talk0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah! You're the one who's going to help!

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You said you'd take me to the ruins with
the {{color id="0"}}huge statues facing each other{{color id="-1"}} that
are in the {{color id="0"}}eastern{{color id="-1"}} part of the desert.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I told you I'd reward you for your help,
right? I wasn't kidding!

So...{{delay8}}please...{{delay8}} Could you get a {{color id="0"}}sleigh seal{{color id="-1"}}
for us to travel with?

---
label: talk0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You said you'd take me to the ruins with
the {{color id="0"}}huge statues facing each other{{color id="-1"}} that's
in the {{color id="0"}}eastern{{color id="-1"}} part of the desert.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Would it be all right for me to get on the
{{color id="0"}}sleigh seal{{color id="-1"}} you rented?

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I see you've prepared a sleigh seal. {{delay8}}Sarq!


Is it OK for me to hop on?

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}What's the matter? {{delay8}}Is something
bothering you?

---
label: 0017
---
Where are we headed?

---
label: 0021
---
We should start over.

---
label: 0018
---
Never mind.

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}We should be heading toward the {{color id="0"}}eastern{{color id="-1"}}
part of the desert, to ruins where {{color id="0"}}huge
statues{{color id="-1"}} face each other.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm sorry... If I hadn't lost my map, this
would be a lot easier.

---
label: 0026
---
We're going to find it!

---
label: talk0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}OK! Drive safely!

---
label: talk0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I see...{{delay8}} In that case, let's get going!

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If you think that's best, then we can do
that. We probably don't want to wander
too far and get lost...
OK. Time to head back to town and start
our search over?

---
label: 0023
---
Let's head to town.

---
label: 0022
---
Actually, let's continue!

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK, back to town we go! It's a good
idea not to push ourselves too hard
in the desert.
Sarq for doing as much as you have.{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And really, it's not like we're giving up.
We're just starting fresh!

---
label: talk0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Oh, OK. If that's what you want, then
that's what we'll do.{{delay8}} Better to be safe
than to overdo it and have an accident.
I'll go ahead and get off the sleigh seal
then, OK?

---
label: 0029
---
Good idea.

---
label: talk0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But it's not like we're giving up or
anything! Let's start over!

---
label: talk0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}All right, I'll be waiting for you here.
Come and talk to me once you're ready!

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Oh! Excellent!{{delay8}} In that case, let's
get going!

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?! What was that?{{delay8}} It startled me...

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey...{{delay8}} If you need something, just come
talk to me about it, OK?

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Whoa, whoa, whoa—careful! Oh no!

---
label: talk0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That was close...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm glad that neither one of us was
seriously injured...{{delay8}} But could you please
try to be a little safer?

---
label: talk0050
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}OUCH! HOT!{{delay8}} STOP, STOP!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That was terrifying!{{delay8}} I can't believe the
sleigh caught fire!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm glad we made it back safely, but
maybe next time we can avoid fire, yeah?

---
label: talk0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Oh... The reins broke...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Well...{{delay8}} I don't think you'll be able to take
me to the ruins in this state.

We'd better head back, get some new
reins, and try again.

---
label: 0028
---
OK, let's head back.

---
label: 0027
---
Go back without me.

---
label: talk0048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}OK! Let's hurry!

---
label: talk0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Sarq for your hard work!{{delay8}} I'm sure it'll go
well next time!

---
label: talk0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Wait, really?{{delay8}} Well, I guess you must
have your reasons...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}All right, then I'll head back to town for
now.{{delay8}} But please take me to the ruins
when you have a chance, OK?

---
label: talk0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, I see you've gotten a sleigh seal
ready! Sarq!

Hrm, but it doesn't look like it's quite
ready to travel the desert...

Let me know when it's in good enough
condition to travel to the ruins!

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}{{size value="125"}}Hey! Hey!{{delay8}} Stop here!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0049
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey, look at that!

---
label: talk0002
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Huge statues...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0042
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}They're facing each—{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hm?

---
label: talk0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}This is another statue, right? It's fallen
over though...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}OK!{{delay8}} I'm sure this is the place I was asked
to investigate!

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sarq! Now that I'm here, I can really
start my investigation!

Oh! {{delay8}}And of course I have to reward you
for your help!

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I can tell right away that this place will be
worth a really thorough look. I've got my
work cut out for me!
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's already interesting. Rotana said these were
supposed to be ruins of the seven heroines here,
so where have the other two gone?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: near1000

Fallen ruins, here?

---
label: near1005

More fallen ruins...

Spiral ruins? Interesting.

Monsters?!

Monsters? We gotta go!

---
label: near1006

Those bones are massive!

---
label: near1007
---
A bone tunnel?

---
label: near1008
---
Ack! A sinkhole!

---
label: near1009
---
Look out for the Molduga!

---
label: near1010
---
This must be its territory...

---
label: near1011
---
Watch out for that cliff...

---
label: near1012
---
Careful of the cliff...

---
label: near1013
---
The ruins are in the east!

---
label: near1014

Should we check a map?
