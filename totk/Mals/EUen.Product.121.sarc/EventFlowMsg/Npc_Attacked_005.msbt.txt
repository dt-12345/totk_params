{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}At my level, you can tell how strong a
weapon is by just looking at it.

And that Lynel weapon you showed me?{{delay8}} 
That was the strongest I've seen in all my
days of looking at weapons!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It's inspired me to get out there, fight a
big monster, and harvest its parts to use
in my own smithing.
Won't be easy. But if I train enough,
I'm sure I can do it!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Question is, what kind of monster should
I go for?{{pageBreak}}A Lynel, like you? Maybe a Hinox?{{delay8}}
Or what about a Talus?{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hello again.


I'm hoping to make a weapon as strong as
the one you showed me.

But to do that, I'll have to fight a big
monster...and that means preparing
myself for a tough battle.

label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To get the materials for a strong weapon,
I'll have to fight one of the biggies.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you were me, what would you go for?{{delay8}}
A Lynel, a Hinox,{{delay8}} or a Talus?

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Any other monster you think I ought
to consider? 

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Didn't you already say that one?{{delay8}}
Well, that's OK.

---
label: 0005
---
A Lynel.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You've got to pretty fearless to take on
a Lynel.

One was spotted northwest of here {{color id="0"}}near
the entrance to Tempest Gulch{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Though knowing you, I guess that one
might've been defeated already.

Lynels are swift, they're strong...{{delay8}}and
they can fling fireballs from a distance.
Not easily beaten.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But if I could {{color id="0"}}get on its back {{color id="-1"}}and ride it
like a horse, maybe I'd have a shot.

---
A Hinox.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But a Hinox... {{delay15}}That one's really for the
stout of heart!

I actually did hear about one at {{color id="0"}}Rist
Peninsula {{color id="-1"}}to the south of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hinox though... {{delay15}}They're huge and can
deal loads of damage.

Strong attacks wouldn't be enough.
I'd have to fortify my defense as well.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Doable, I think... But I'll need to get some
better armor and stock up on food.

---
A Talus.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}A Talus though... {{delay15}}Fighting one of those
takes real guts!

I did hear a rumor that there's one in
{{color id="0"}}North Akkala Foothill{{color id="-1"}} to the northwest
of here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But those things are solid as boulders...{{delay8}}
I doubt my current weapon would even
make one flinch.
If I want to fight a Talus, I'll have to invest
in a hammer that can smash rocks.

Goodbye.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Right! I'd better train.{{delay8}} Have to be ready if
I want to beat one of those monsters.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Off to fight monsters that come out
at night? How very you!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, sure! Maybe stick around and listen
to a song or two though? {{delay8}}Really helps to
calm the prebattle jitters.

Gotta be prepared.
