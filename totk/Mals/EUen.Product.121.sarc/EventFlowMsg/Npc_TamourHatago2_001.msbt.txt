{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Getting things done early? That's a
good idea.

---
label: Greeting_Noon
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ugh, it's blazing hot. Cool off in the shade
if you're feeling faint.

---
label: Greeting_Evening
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Are you traveling too? You must have
had a rough time in that heat. I'm glad it
cooled off a little.

---
label: Greeting_Night
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Brr, it's cold. You're going to freeze out
here if you're not prepared.

---
label: Talk_PointA_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey. {{delay8}}Did you also come here to relax?


The desert is harsh. But here, we can
stock up on clothes, food, and arrows.{{delay8}} 
We get to sleep in nice, fluffy beds...
I almost wish I could stay awhile.
But my adventurous spirit won't let me
settle in one place for long.

---
label: Talk_PointA_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Come to think of it, the pond seems to
have dried up since last I was here...

Is that due to the Upheaval, I wonder?

---
label: Talk_PointA_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Say, it looks like the pond has a lot
more water than last I was here.

When the sand shroud disappeared,
I heard the waterways in Gerudo Town
started flowing again.
I wonder if the sand shroud was affecting
the pond as well.

---
label: Talk_PointA_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Here, not only do we have food and
clothes but we can also stock up on
arrows and sleep in fluffy beds...
It's a real oasis in the middle of this
harsh desert.

---
label: Talk_PointRest_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I found the perfect bit of roof, so I'm
taking a break.{{pageBreak}}There aren't many places to rest in
Gerudo Canyon, after all.{{pageBreak}}If you don't rest when you can, you'll
regret it. Oh yes, you will.

---
label: Talk_PointRest_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You should take time to rest. Out here,
you need to keep your strength up.{{pageBreak}}It's easy to get completely exhausted
without even realizing it.

---
label: Talk_PointB_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have absolutely no interest in ruins, but
I respect the folks who research them.{{pageBreak}}Even in a harsh environment like this,
they keep up their studies.{{pageBreak}}If you have any questions about ruins
or the Zonai,{{delay8}} I bet they would be the
people to ask.

---
label: Talk_PointB_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you have any questions about ruins
or the Zonai, {{delay8}}you should try asking the
Zonai Survey Team members.

label: Talk_Between_A_Rest_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I hear plenty of travelers through the
desert and Gerudo Canyon have collapsed
since the climate shifted.{{pageBreak}}It should be fine if you have food that
suits the temperature though.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Well,{{delay8}} just make sure you don't overdo it!

---
label: Talk_Between_A_Rest_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you can cook food that suits the
temperature, dealing with the hot and
cold weather here becomes a lot easier.
Traveling the canyon isn't something you
should take on lightly. You should do
everything you can to stay safe.

---
label: Talk_Between_A_Rest_00_Back
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The swing in temperature from day to
night sure makes traveling tricky.
Preparation is the key.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I always keep elixirs on hand that can heat
me up or cool me down. Without them, I'd
be done for!

---
label: Talk_Between_A_Rest_01_Back
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Me, I check my stock every day to make
sure I don't run out of elixirs to warm me
up or cool me down.
I wouldn't miss a single day! Don't you
forget to check your stock either.

label: Talk_Between_B_Rest_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're looking for a stable, you can
take this road {{color id="0"}}northeast {{color id="-1"}}to find
{{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}.
There's also Gerudo Canyon Stable
to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} Ah, shoot, never mind.
That one's closed.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sad story... {{delay15}}Horses couldn't make it
there in the harsh climate, so all the
business dried up.

---
label: Talk_Between_B_Rest_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sadly, {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}
isn't running anymore.

So if you need a stable,{{delay8}} your best bet is
{{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}What do you see when you look up?


Those sky islands appeared after the
Upheaval, right? I have trouble believing
my own eyes some days.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What are they? What's up there?{{delay15}}
And why do they float?

I can't get those islands out of my mind.


{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I bet someone standing up there would
see things no one's ever noticed before.{{delay8}}
Maybe I'll work out a way to get there.

---
label: Talk_Between_B_Rest_01_Back
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wonder what it's like to look down from
one of those floating islands.

Everything far below, the whole world
open to you...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}It's a shame I'm no good with heights.
I'd be scared to look down.

---
label: Balloon_PointA_00
---
It's truly an oasis.

---
label: Balloon_PointRest
---
I'm taking a break.

---
label: Balloon_PointB
---
Impressive...

---
label: Balloon_Between_A_Rest
---
I'm hungry...

---
label: Balloon_Between_A_Rest_Back
---
Do I have enough elixirs?

---
label: Balloon_Between_B_Rest
---
Wish I could ride a horse...

---
label: Balloon_Between_B_Rest_Back
---
I'd like to go there...

---
label: SavedLv1_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I thought they were just small fry, so I
let my guard down.

---
label: SavedLv1_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I underestimated them. They didn't seem
so tough...

---
label: SavedLv2_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Those monsters moved so fast!
I'm shaking just thinking about it.

---
label: SavedLv2_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Those darn monsters. They're sure
getting confident!

---
label: SavedLv3_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Whew! That was a close one.

---
label: SavedLv3_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}That was one scary monster. I couldn't
do anything!

---
label: Failed00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}What a mess!

---
label: Failed01

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can't believe it... Me, of all people...

---
label: Atacked00

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Th-this thing! It came out of nowhere!

label: Atacked01

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}This monster is no joke!

---
label: Guardian00

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}What is that?! I'm no match for this!

---
label: Thanks00

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Sorry you had to lend a hand there.
Take this, at least.

label: NakedPlayer_00

Where's the style in that?

What a wild streak!

You look comfortable.
