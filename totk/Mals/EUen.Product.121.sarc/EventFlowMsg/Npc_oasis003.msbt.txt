{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I will do my best to learn more of what is
happening with Zelda before we meet
again. Make sure to come back and visit!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Oh, and don't forget... Even when I
cannot be by your side, you can always
call on my power as a sage.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Link! I'm glad to see you!{{pageBreak}}Have you been to Lookout Landing yet?
I sent Buliara there. {{delay15}}If you find her, say hi
for me, OK?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I haven't gotten any new information
about Zelda. It seems she hasn't been
around here recently.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Link! I'm glad to see you here! {{delay8}}Are you
finding my new power as a sage helpful?

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I haven't found any clues about the fifth
sage yet, but I'm not about to give up!

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I don't know if you'll find this information
helpful, but...

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}What? You found the fifth sage?


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Interesting. So she's an ancient Zonai
named Mineru...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}And even though she's lost her original
body, she's pledged to fight alongside us
as the Sage of Spirit!

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link! It's good to see you. How are the
preparations to defeat the Demon King
coming along?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}As sages, our power is yours.{{delay15}} All that
remains now is for you to defeat the
Demon King.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You're a welcome sight, Link! And how
is the search for the fifth sage going?
Her name was...Mineru?

---
label: Talk_10
---
I imagine that once you've found the fifth
sage, you'll be setting out to confront the
Demon King...
I'll be prepared for when that battle
comes. You can count on me!

Now that I think about it...

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Near_01

Where she points...

label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Near_02

Is that...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}After I became a sage and returned
to town, I discovered an interesting
ancient reference...
"Seek out the swordswoman upon the
sand and look to where she points—
there is treasure waiting underground."
That was written in an old document
I discovered.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I doubt it holds any connection to Zelda,
but it might be a clue to something...

The swordswoman upon the sand...{{delay8}}
Treasure underground...{{delay8}} It could be worth
looking into.

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Link,{{delay8}} did you find the desert treasure?


"Seek out the swordswoman upon the
sand and look to where she points—
there is treasure waiting underground."
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There are countless swordswomen statues
in this desert. The only option might be to
see where each one directs you...

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Link, is that the treasure the old
document mentioned?

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Link, the helm you're wearing... Is it the
treasure the old document mentioned?

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? You already found it?

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? The helm you're wearing...{{delay8}}
That's the treasure mentioned in that
old document?

---
label: GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}I see... So, the treasure was armor
affiliated with the ancient Gerudo...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I knew you'd be able to find it. {{delay8}}Take it
with you, and make good use of it.

Hmm?
