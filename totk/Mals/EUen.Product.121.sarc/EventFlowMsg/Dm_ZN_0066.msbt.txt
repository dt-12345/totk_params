{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}{{size value="80"}}Calip! Did you see that?! Lightning struck that
dragon pillar too!{{pageBreak}}Huh? Is someone in those ruins?!{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh! It's you again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We think a terrible lightning strike hit
here, but I'm glad to see you weren't hurt.

label: Talk_002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've never seen lightning strike like that!
And even stranger, the dragon statues'
eyes seemed to glow just before it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Link, if you know anything about this,
fill us in on what happened!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Unbelievable...{{pageBreak}}A mechanism in the ancient ruins got
rid of the thunderclouds and revealed
some new sky islands?

label: Talk_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Great catch! Another amazing discovery
on the books. {{delay8}}In fact, I'd say...

---
label: Talk_004

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}It's the haul of the century!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's a significant discovery, to be sure.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd like to go investigate further, but we
have no way of getting up there.

---
label: Talk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hmm. You're right.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}That doesn't make it any less exciting,
though. We need to report this to Purah
right away.

label: Talk_007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Calip, I'm going back to Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}I want to write up the recent events
around the floating Ring Ruin in a report
for Purah.{{pageBreak}}You should stick around here to conduct
a thorough investigation. Find out if there
are any more discoveries to be made!

---
label: Talk_008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wha— {{delay8}}Remain here? You mean...alone?

---
label: Talk_009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Yes! Even if we can't get up to the sky,
there's so much to discover on land!{{pageBreak}}It's our duty to unravel all of it. You can
do this, Calip!

label: Talk_017
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}He wants me to investigate alone? Fieldwork isn't
my strongest suit...{{pageBreak}}But this may be my chance to make a historic
discovery!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Right! {{delay15}}Leave this to me, Tauro. {{delay8}}I'll begin
preparing at once.{{pageBreak}}I'll need to head back to our base of
operations for a bit first.

---
label: Talk_010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh! I didn't expect to find you here.{{delay8}} I see
you rushed off to these Zonai Ruins ahead
of us researchers.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We came when we saw what looked like
lightning striking this dragon statue. I'm
glad to see you weren't hurt.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh! I didn't expect to find you here.{{delay8}} I see
you rushed off ahead of us researchers.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Tauro told me he didn't see you, so I was
worried something might have happened.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}I'm glad you're all right! I've never seen
lightning strike like that before.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}And even stranger, the dragon statues'

Of course it's raining.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, it's you. I see you've found my base
of operations for surveying.

label: Talk_208

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The new sky islands you discovered were
an amazing find.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd love to explore them myself, but we
have no way of getting up that high.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}If only I could fly. {{delay15}}Think of all the research
breakthroughs I could make!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Oh yes, what was I saying? {{delay8}}I lost myself
in thought there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since last we met, I've been keeping up
my investigation of the ruins.

---
label: Talk_201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No doubt an amateur ruins enthusiast
like you is curious how that's proceeding.{{pageBreak}}Sad to say, it's a bit early for that now.
The investigation is still underway.{{pageBreak}}Even now, I'm hard at work processing
everything I've learned. {{delay15}}NOT resting idly,
as some dullards might believe.

---
label: Talk_202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Yes... This is my chance to do some solo work.{{pageBreak}}I'll get results, and with them, recognition at last!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Not now! Can't you see it's raining?
This is no time for a leisurely chat!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Excuse me, but you're standing in the
way of science. Talk to me once I get to

Zzz... All the credit...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}No time now. I must rest and think on
what I've learned. We'll talk tomorrow.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Please, let me enjoy this lovely morning.
We can chat once I've left my tent to
start the day.
