{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Heh...{{delay8}} That wasn't even a warm-up for
you, was it? It's written all over your face.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}I appreciate the rescue, but it was
hardly necessary for a foe like that.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Not bad!{{delay15}} But I can tell you're capable of
so much more...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}An uncharacteristic blunder on my part.{{delay15}}

Away, away!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You want to help? Heh. {{delay8}}A situation such

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As you can see, I'm a little tied up with

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Though I may not look it, I am a monster
hunter of some small renown.

I spend my days traveling the lands of
Hyrule in pursuit of a myriad of prey.

At the request of a fellow named {{color id="0"}}Koltin{{color id="-1"}},
I'm presently hunting {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs{{color id="-1"}}—{{delay8}}
mysterious, cave-dwelling creatures.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've heard that one such beast lurks in a
cave in {{color id="0"}}this very region{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The question is, which cave?

---
label: GoodBye00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I could just determine which cave it's
hiding in, slaying the {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}} would
be simplicity itself!{{delay8}}
But until I find that all-important cave,
I cannot demonstrate my worth.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's supposed to be somewhere nearby
too... Perhaps I'll search more thoroughly
after I've rested my mind and body.

---
label: GoodBye01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm glad our paths have crossed yet again.{{delay15}}

Reports of a Bubbulfrog sighting in a
nearby cave drew me to this area.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But I cannot find the cave in question.{{delay15}}
It should be {{color id="0"}}close{{color id="-1"}}, but alas, the report
was less detailed than one might hope.
Hmph. Confounded {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} It must
have heard I was coming for it and hidden
itself away somewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}But on my reputation as a monster hunter,
I swear I will bring it to light!

---
label: GoodBye01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I heard tell there was a cave that housed
a {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}} in this area, but all of my
searching has come to naught.
Perhaps someone else has caused the
beast to move on...{{delay8}}leaving me to grapple
with my greatest foe yet—free time.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I've got it!{{delay15}} While you're here, why don't
I regale you with tales of the numerous
cave creatures I've matched mettle with?
You are an adventurer, are you not? I'm
certain you'll find my stories educational!

---
label: GoodBye01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}They say a {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}} lurks in cave near
here, but my search proved fruitless.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Now that I've lost my prey, I find myself
with an abundance of free time. Might I
tell you another cave-monster tale?

label: Talk00_00

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Here's one...{{delay15}} Have you heard of the beast
known as the {{color id="0"}}Horriblin{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}They're a recently discovered monster,
making their nefarious lairs in caves
across the land.
{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Of particular note is their distinctive,
{{color id="0"}}hammer-shaped horn{{color id="-1"}}.

Horriblins come in a variety of colors,
each with their {{color id="0"}}own horn shape{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The horns of stronger varieties tend to be
larger and tougher. Perhaps there's some
way to put those horns to use...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Should you ever find yourself
face-to-wretched-face with a Horriblin,
be sure to observe it carefully.

---
label: Talk00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Be sure to take care as you journey into a
cave. You might find your path blocked by
monsters known as {{color id="0"}}Horriblins{{color id="-1"}}.
Each has a unique, {{color id="0"}}hammer-shaped horn{{color id="-1"}}
atop its head.{{delay8}} The stronger the variant,
the {{color id="0"}}larger and tougher{{color id="-1"}} the horn.
Should you face off against these beasts,
it would serve you well to make careful
note of their horns.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Have you had the displeasure of
encountering a {{color id="0"}}Like Like{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}These loathsome monsters swallow up
anyone who gets too close, {{color id="0"}}stealing their
swords and shields{{color id="-1"}} in the process.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Clever hunters like myself know that the
beast's {{color id="0"}}weak point is the tongue in its
maw{{color id="-1"}}, but opportunities to strike it are few.
They're troublesome foes indeed... But
my last encounter with one offered some
food for thought.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I was searching through a cave when an
unnoticed Like Like attacked me from my
blind spot.
The sudden strike rattled my composure,
and I tried to fend it off with the {{color id="0"}}torch{{color id="-1"}}
I had on hand.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}The torch ignited the beast.{{delay15}} As the fire
spread across its body, it let out a groan,
exposing its tongue!
Though I can only speak to my own
experience,{{delay15}} it seems {{color id="0"}}the creature may
well be weak to fire{{color id="-1"}}.
It might be worth testing that theory
yourself next time you run into one.

---
label: Talk01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The equipment-stealing {{color id="0"}}Like Like{{color id="-1"}} does not
readily show its {{color id="0"}}weak point—its tongue{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But when, by chance, I set fire to one's
body, it groaned and stuck out its tongue.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}{{color id="0"}}They may well be weak to fire.{{color id="-1"}}{{delay15}} Should you
encounter one in a cave, give it a try.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}We've discussed {{color id="0"}}Like Likes {{color id="-1"}}before, but
did you know that different types exist?{{pageBreak}}Why, I recently encountered one that
{{color id="0"}}spat rocks out of its mouth{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}And if that weren't troublesome enough,
the beast's body was covered in rocks! It
shrugged off even my respectable strikes.
I had no choice but to turn my back upon
that rocky tyrant and flee the cave as fast
as I could.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh*{{delay15}} How thrilling it would have been to
send those rocks the creature spat {{color id="0"}}back
the way they came{{color id="-1"}}...

label: Talk02_01

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}All {{color id="0"}}Like Likes {{color id="-1"}}are troublesome, but the
variant that spits rocks may be the worst
I've yet encountered.
Its body is covered in stone so tough that
even my mighty strikes had no effect.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If only I could {{color id="0"}}send the rocks the creature
spat back the way they came{{color id="-1"}}...

My search for {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs {{color id="-1"}}yet continues,
as per {{color id="0"}}Koltin's{{color id="-1"}} request.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Though admittedly, the Bubbulfrog rumor
is running somewhat dry. {{delay8}}Worse still, my
client seems to have disappeared.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But a hunter must make opportunities out
of obstacles! I'll be searching the cave for
glowing mushrooms and exploding fruit.
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That way I'll be prepared for any monster
I may encounter!

---
label: Talk03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I do not know where {{color id="0"}}Koltin{{color id="-1"}} has gone.
He's the one who hired me to seek out
the {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So for the time being, I've decided to
polish my skills as a monster hunter by
exploring different caves.
In addition to monsters to fight, caves are
filled with nourishing mushrooms and fish.
It's all a hunter could ever need.

---
label: Talk04_00

The whereabouts of my former client
{{color id="0"}}Koltin {{color id="-1"}}may be unknown, but that will not
deter me from exploring every cave I find.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My next goal is challenging the Depths...
{{delay15}}There dwell monsters stronger than any
found in the caves.
Every cave I visit is a new opportunity to
train. When I finally do enter the Depths,
I want to be ready for anything.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Perhaps our journeys will converge again.
{{delay15}}Until then, take care!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You're clearly becoming just as
