{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Can you believe it? {{delay8}}There are {{color id="0"}}Zonai ruins{{color id="-1"}}
even in the {{color id="0"}}sky{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}After the Upheaval, several Zonai ruins
suddenly appeared up there.

If I could sprout wings and fly into the
sky, I'd go investigate right away!

label: Kakariko_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I take it the spot that's been {{color id="0"}}circled twice{{color id="-1"}}
is the {{color id="0"}}floating ring{{color id="-1"}}.

What a well-made map!

label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}But why is it that we {{color id="0"}}can't investigate {{color id="-1"}}the
{{color id="0"}}floating ring{{color id="-1"}}? Seems such a shame...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, I'm sorry.{{delay15}} Did you want to look at the

By all means, go ahead! I'm sorry for
hogging it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you want to know more about the

staring straight up at it.

I'm pleased full investigations into the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Are you...{{delay8}}traveling to see the sights?{{delay8}}


{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I don't blame you. The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} are
really something.

And they really put {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} on
the map. It didn't get nearly as many
visitors before the Upheaval.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I'm sure the influx of tourists poses a
challenge. But the new chief, {{color id="0"}}Paya{{color id="-1"}},
seems to be taking things in stride.

label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Before the Upheaval, {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
was a quiet little town.

But now it's downright famous! People are
calling it{{delay8}} "the home of the Ring Ruins."

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}It's a big change for a tiny little village.
But I'm told the new chief, {{color id="0"}}Paya{{color id="-1"}}, is taking
things in stride.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Do you think that rain...{{delay15}}falls on the
{{color id="0"}}sky ruins {{color id="-1"}}too?

There's so much we can't learn if we can't
get up there. {{delay8}}If only I could fly!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder if rain falls on the {{color id="0"}}sky ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
One more mystery to solve!

---
label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Are you...{{delay8}}traveling to see the sights?{{delay8}}
If so, let me give you a tip.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Do you see the mountain beyond the
lake there? And the {{color id="0"}}ruins atop it{{color id="-1"}}?

That's one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell
from the sky and came crashing down
around {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The village now has visitors who come
to see the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. But I hear it was
terrifying when they came down.
Though...{{delay15}}maybe it goes without saying
that {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}} huge ruins falling from the sky
would be terrifying.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You're here to...{{delay8}}see the sights, right?{{delay8}}


And let me guess—the sights you want to
see are the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}!
I'm right, aren't I?
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But then, you don't have to be psychic to
figure that out. After all, {{color id="0"}}you can't find
ruins like that anywhere else{{color id="-1"}}.

label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You're here to...{{delay8}}see the sights, right?{{delay8}}


And let me guess—you want to see the
{{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}} of {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}! I'm right, huh?

{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I hear she's an amazing leader who rebuilt
the village. The folks there love her!

---
label: GoRange_02_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh! But don't let me keep you.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} is right down the road.

label: BackRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh, interesting! Approaching a member
of the Zonai Survey Team?{{delay8}} Then you must
be curious about the Zonai too.
The Zonai civilization was just a legend...{{delay8}}
but now their ancient ruins are right
before our eyes.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} at {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} are

Or are you returning from there?
The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} around {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
have become a popular destination.
It's only natural to want to see them.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I can heartily say, as a member of the

stoke everyone's interest in the Zonai!
