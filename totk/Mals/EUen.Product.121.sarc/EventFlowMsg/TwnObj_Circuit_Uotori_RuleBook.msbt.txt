Racing Tips.

1. Take a look at the route in advance to
visualize your path through the course.

---
label: Talk_0014
---
2. Your vehicle will not perform as well if it
is tilting on the water. Balance is key!

---
label: Talk_0015
---
3. Since you can't make sharp turns or
decelerate, it's important to steer
carefully and not rush through the course.

---
4. Trial and error is essential to building a
good vehicle. If you're struggling to finish
the race, try changing up your design.
