{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}That man mentioned an abandoned mine
to the southwest. I suspect that he is
referring to the {{color id="0"}}former Gerudo Mine{{color id="-1"}}.
That place flourished with activity long
ago like this one. Ore was constantly
unearthed and refined.
There are {{color id="0"}}statues that point the way{{color id="-1"}} to
the Abandoned Gerudo Mine. Follow them
to reach that destination.
