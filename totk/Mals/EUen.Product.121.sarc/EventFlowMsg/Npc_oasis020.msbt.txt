{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}I guess it is true. I'd heard the guards
talking about it, but I still didn't believe a
voe was actually here.
I'm impressed. You made it all the way
here, through the sand shroud...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! {{delay15}}Did you rent a sand seal to get here?

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, you're the voe from before, right?
For some reason I thought you'd left
town. Did you come back?
I can't believe you're just traveling around
in this sand shroud without a worry...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! {{delay15}}Did you rent a sand seal to
get around?

---
label: 0013
---
I did!

---
label: 0014
---
Nope!

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso!


In that case, you must have stopped at
the shop my mom runs near the entrance
to the desert!

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Then you visited the shop my mom runs at
the entrance to the desert!

Sarqso for everything!

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? But if you didn't rent one...


{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}No, he couldn't have found a wild one. The
sand shroud has made it almost impossible
to track them down...
Does that mean he walked?{{delay15}} Ha, that's even harder
to believe than him finding a wild sand seal!{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Oh, you voe! Are all of you such
pranksters?{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0023

You obviously must have rented one from
the shop near the {{color id="0"}}entrance to the desert{{color id="-1"}}!
It's the only answer that makes sense.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso for your business!

You obviously must have rented one from

It's the only answer that makes sense.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}My mom runs that shop! Sarqso for
your business!

---
label: talk0001
---
My mom and I are in the business of
training sand seals and renting them out
to folks!

---
label: talk0007
---
The sand shroud has made it far too
dangerous to go aboveground right
now, so my shop is temporarily closed...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But if you've got questions about sand
seals, I'd be happy to answer them!

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}sand seals {{color id="-1"}}can sense the unease in
the air, so I'm trying to give them
constant attention and care.
I'm not too worried about the ones
here—they're plenty safe.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's the {{color id="0"}}wild sand seals{{color id="-1"}} out in the desert
I'm worried about. I hope they're OK in
the sand shroud...

---
label: 0016
---
Sand seals?

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sand seals are special animals that live in
the Gerudo Desert.

I'm sure you've noticed your feet getting
stuck in the sand when you walk across
the dunes, right?
Well, not only do these little ones call
the desert their home but they breeze
through it with ease!
That's only one reason that they're vital
to our way of life!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And they aren't easy to catch and train
either! It takes a lot of work!

Luckily, folks like me are happy to do it.
I'm proud of the sand seals I've trained,
and I'm happy to rent them to travelers!

---
label: 0017
---
Wild sand seals?

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yup! {{delay8}}You'll often see them if you're out
wandering in the desert.

But they're extremely wary creatures.{{delay8}}
If they notice you, they'll flee faster than
you can say "vasaaq"!
Of course, I've mastered the art of
stealth. {{delay8}}I can easily sneak up on them
very, very slowly...

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even if you manage to get hold of a wild
sand seal...

the moment you let those reins drop, that
sand seal is done with you and heading
for the dunes!
Most folks don't want to go through all
the trouble, so they just rent one instead.

label: 0018

Goodbye.

---
label: talk0028

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I hope the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} clears up soon.
I can't make a living if I can't rent out
sand seals...

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}That customer seemed to be having a really rough
time. I wish there was some way I could help...

But if she doesn't even know where she wants to go,
there isn't much I can do.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}Last I saw, she was still near the {{color id="0"}}east gate{{color id="-1"}}. That

label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, I'm sorry...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}This is my sand-seal rental shop. You can
rent a sand seal from me here!

Sand seals can breeze through the desert
with ease and are an essential way to
get around!
And all my trained ones have been
cooped up in the shelter for a while, so
they're full of energy and ready to go!

---
label: Talk_1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Don't they just look so happy now that
they're back up on the surface?

After being down in the shelter for so
long, is it any wonder that they're full of
energy and ready to go?
They're more excited than ever to go skirt
across the dunes!

---
label: Talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The sand seals we rent out are strong,
loyal, and most important of all...{{delay15}}CUTE!

If you're planning on going out into the
desert, please rent one to take with you!{{delay15}}
You won't regret it!

---
label: Talk_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Renting a sand seal costs {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
Or, if you're interested in a sleigh seal—
a sand seal with a sleigh—it's {{color id="0"}}50 rupees{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 0010
---
I'll rent one.

---
label: 0011
---
How does this work?

---
label: 0015
---
How do I catch one?

---
label: 0012
---
I won't rent one.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All you have to do is guide the {{color id="0"}}sand seal{{color id="-1"}}
in the direction you want to go. It's easy!

Oh, and you'll need a {{color id="0"}}shield{{color id="-1"}} when you
surf, so don't forget to equip one.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Other than that, you'd be all set!
You can surf the desert dunes to your
heart's content!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sand seals are especially sensitive to the
sounds around them.

The trick is to approach very,
very slowly...

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a bit of a pain in the neck though,
so most everyone in town prefers to rent
one instead.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're not sure what to do, why not
just rent one and see how it goes?

---
label: talk0030

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Are you sure you'll be OK without
a sand seal?

---
label: talk0011

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}If you go for a casual stroll in the desert
at this time of day, you'll overheat in
no time!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A sand seal or a sleigh seal—{{delay8}}what are
you thinking?

A sand seal, please.

A sleigh seal, please.

---
label: 0003

Never mind.

---
label: SunaTalk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh...you should probably equip a shield.
You'll need one if you want to go sand-
seal surfing.
I can sell you one though! It'd bring the
total to {{color id="0"}}50 rupees{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}}, but you really need it
to surf. What do you say?

---
label: 0006
---
I'll take a shield.

---
label: 0007
---
I don't want a shield.

---
label: SunaTalk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh! It looks like you've already got plenty
of shields in your pouch.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You don't need to bother getting one from
me then! Just equip one of the ones you
have, and then talk to me!

---
label: SunaTalk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}You know, if you're a little strapped for
rupees, you could always go visit one of
the shops and sell a thing or two.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm sure you're carrying all sorts of things
that folks would be interested in buying—{{delay15}}
see if you can raise the rupees you need!

---
label: SunaTalk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Before I forget, if you try riding using a
shield that has stuff attached to it, you're
probably going to eat sand. Trust me.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}All right then, I hope you and your little
sand seal have an amazing trip!

You'll depart through the east gate!
