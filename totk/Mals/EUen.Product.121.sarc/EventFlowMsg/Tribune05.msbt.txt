{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner. Get a good night's sleep?{{delay15}}
Oh, {{delay8}}actually, hold that thought.{{delay15}} We don't
have time to squawk right now.

---
label: talk0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner. How you doing?{{delay15}} Actually,{{delay8}}
let's just get to it.{{delay8}} You're always on an
even keel.

---
label: talk0050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner. You have a good day?{{delay15}}
Oh, {{delay8}}actually, hold that thought.{{delay15}} We can
squawk all about it later.

---
label: talk0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This rain, huh, partner? Will it ever end?
Oh, {{delay8}}no need to answer that.{{delay15}} I know it'll
end at some point. Just making small talk.

label: talk0000

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I got a very interesting lead about our
missing princess. We could have a pretty
huge story here.
Sounds as if one night a while back—and
I'm not sure how far—{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}
borrowed this stable's farm tools.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That's a bit unusual. Why would our
princess...{{delay8}}need farm tools?{{delay15}} But this story
has another odd twist.
She promised to return them...{{delay8}}and didn't.{{delay15}}
Now, this all might seem trivial. She's a
busy princess, after all.
Still, these are strange times. So I got to
thinking—only {{color id="0"}}weapons decayed {{color id="-1"}}during
the Upheaval.
Maybe the princess was in desperate
need of tools for...{{delay15}} Wait, Penn...{{delay8}} Hold on.
You've gotten ahead of yourself.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}We need to gather the facts—when, what,
where, who!

Let's start at the beginning. I heard that
a man named {{color id="0"}}Izra{{color id="-1"}} lent her the tools.

He's right around here—watches over
the stable's raft, I heard. Let's get to
work, partner.

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What did {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}need those
{{color id="0"}}farm tools {{color id="-1"}}for?

I have a wild guess that it's because only
{{color id="0"}}weapons decayed {{color id="-1"}}during the Upheaval,
and that would mean...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}No, we need facts! I heard that a man
named {{color id="0"}}Izra{{color id="-1"}} spoke to the princess. I think
he watches over the raft at this stable.

---
label: Near_Ready_1001

Could be a huge story...

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sorry, I'm a little busy right now...

---
label: talk0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sorry to turn you away, but I'm a little
busy right now.

---
label: 0001
---
You saw the princess?

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh... I was wondering when you guys
would show up. You work with Penn from
the newspaper, right?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I didn't want this to get out, because I
don't want people to think I'm saying bad
things about {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.
But she borrowed our stable's {{color id="0"}}farm tools{{color id="-1"}}
and hasn't given them back.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That was a long time ago, but I do
remember she said she needed them for
something at {{color id="0"}}Floret Sandbar{{color id="-1"}}.
It's around the river bend and then a
good distance after that.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'd take the raft there myself, but after all
{{color id="0"}}that stuff fell from the sky{{color id="-1"}}, I'm having a
hard time getting down the river.
So you might say I'm in a bind.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh*{{delay15}} I know we could clear up this mess
if someone could take me downriver to
{{color id="0"}}Floret Sandbar{{color id="-1"}} on the raft.

---
label: talk0068
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey! That raft belongs to the stable.
Don't go cutting the rope without my
permission.

---
label: talk0069
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, hold on there! You've gotta wait for
me to get aboard before you cut the rope.

---
label: talk0070
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}...Phew.{{delay8}} All right. Ready.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?!{{delay8}} You mean that, fella? You'll take
me to {{color id="0"}}Floret Sandbar{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks!{{delay8}} Can't tell you how much I
appreciate you offering to do that.

---
label: talk0061
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, you're going to take me to {{color id="0"}}Floret
Sandbar{{color id="-1"}} on this raft?

---
label: talk0062
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks, fella!{{delay8}} I'm counting on you!

---
label: talk0059

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What the—{{delay8}} Where's my raft?{{delay8}} I better put
it back where it was to start.

label: talk0060

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There we go...{{delay8}} Whew!{{delay8}} Close one!

---
label: talk0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm ready whenever you—


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Um, hold on. {{delay8}}I can't sit down in the chair.

---
label: talk0072
---
Don't forget to cut the rope when you're
ready to launch!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You take it from here!

---
label: talk0075
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You take it from here! Just cut the rope
when you're ready to launch.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}I wonder why Princess Zelda won't
give the stable's tools back.

I want to go downriver to {{color id="0"}}Floret Sandbar{{color id="-1"}}
and find out what happened, but I'm
having a hard time with the raft.

I can take you!

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Urgh.{{delay15}} How can I get any work done right
unless I get the stable's tools back?

---
label: talk0082
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hm! We're a little too far.{{delay8}} Would you stop
right by the dock?

label: talk0014

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{size value="125"}}Woo-hoo! We made it!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You did a great job getting us here!
Where'd you learn how to handle a raft
like that?
I thought it'd be a rough run, but it all
turned out fine.

---
label: talk0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Huh? Up in the sky! There's something...{{delay8}}
er, someone...{{delay8}}coming at us!

---
label: talk0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Whew... Finally caught up with you two!


I was flying around this whole area,
partner, trying to find our facts, when I
saw you on this raft.
I figured you'd chased down our story,
so I flew right on down to help. But, uh...{{delay8}}
where are we?

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}HEY!{{delay15}}


What do you think you're doing, just
barging in here? This place is for flowers
and plants—all of them, precious!
You'd better watch out. You'll rue the
day you trample on any of them!

---
label: talk0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa! Who's this?{{delay8}} Ever met her
before, partner?

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}S-{{delay8}}sorry, ma'am!{{delay8}} We're just looking for
some {{color id="0"}}farm tools{{color id="-1"}} that I lent to {{color id="0"}}Princess
Zelda{{color id="-1"}} a ways back!
I promise we won't pick any flowers.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Picking them? I'm more worried about
you kicking them!{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0083
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{delay8}}Wait a minute... {{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}Farm tools?{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}} Did you say
something about {{color id="0"}}farm tools{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That's right—some {{color id="0"}}farm tools {{color id="-1"}}from our
stable. I want them back!

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, well. That's my fault. I have them.


This area is home to {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}'s
plant sanctuary. She asked me to take
care of this special place with her.
She loved these plants, and spent a lot of
time here, making sure the garden beds
were happy homes for them.
We meant to return the tools after we
finished our work here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But the princess—well,{{delay8}} they say she
went {{color id="0"}}missing{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And all our hard work was ruined when...{{delay8}}
oh, these darn ruins crashed down!
It's been really awful.
I've been working so hard since then to
try to make it all nice again.

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Really? {{delay8}}That's what happened?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now I think about it, I didn't tell the
princess how soon I needed our stable's
tools back.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As long as they're in good condition,
it's no problem. I'll just go ahead and take
them with me if you're done.
Now I feel guilty for some reason. Didn't
mean to make you hurry it up.

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All this was about a sanctuary for plants
and flowers, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sounds just like our princess to find time
to work on a garden alongside folks while
restoring Hyrule.

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've tried to make these garden beds as
perfect as they were before.

It's just so hard on my own. If only
someone would help...

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure. Glad to help. Keep the tools a little
longer. And here's a tip...

Don't overwork the soil.

---
label: talk0084
---
And also...{{delay15}}nope. That's all I got.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Uh...{{delay15}}what's with the face?

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You said you'll help! I accept your offer!

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?! I didn't say that!

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well, close enough! So what if you don't
say what you really think. I won't hold
that against you!
Now, how about you go work that soil
like you said. I'll go tend to the flowers.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We'll have this whole garden back in
beautiful shape by the time the princess
returns. It'll be the pride of Hyrule.
Oh! And here's a tip from me...{{delay30}} Put your
back into it!

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}*sigh* Can't talk my way out of this one...{{delay15}}


And she'd, uh, probably wreck the tools if she
used 'em wrong.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK, fine.{{delay8}} Seems like I'm up the creek
without a paddle here. Or down it.
Either way, I'll help.

---
label: talk0076
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can go. I'll stay here. What else
have I got to do, right?

---
label: talk0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, seems like we got those facts we
wanted,{{delay8}} and those two...{{delay8}}worked it all
out, I guess?
I can't wait to write this up. Our readers
love glimpses into the princess's life. Here
she was, helping to create a garden.
Expect the story in an issue of the paper
soon. It'll be a real headline!
