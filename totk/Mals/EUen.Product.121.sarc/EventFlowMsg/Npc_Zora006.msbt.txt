{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Wow! {{delay8}}I can scarcely believe that someone
was able to make it to the domain through
all of that nasty sludge!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}All the more reason that I must work
tirelessly to restore our beautiful
Zora's Domain.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I am working hard to scrub off the sludge.


Next I must help clean up the plaza!
That dreaded sludge fell there as well.

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}After I finish a bit more of my cleaning
here, I will move on to the plaza! That
dreaded sludge fell there as well.

label: near0000
---
My, this is rough...

---
label: talk0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sheesh... {{delay8}}If I fail to clean this completely,
the sludge mixes into the water, and
it spreads.
And if it enters your gills, it causes
nothing but trouble!{{delay15}} Your body breaks
down until you can hardly move.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I must work tirelessly so that our children
live long enough to speak with true
Zora eloquence!

---
label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I must clean the sludge off thoroughly!


{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}If I don't work hard, our young Zora
children will not have the chance to
grow and learn to speak eloquently.

---
label: 0020
---
Eloquence?

---
label: 0021
---
See you around.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}We Zora tend to speak more eloquently
after reaching middle age.

I hope that when I reach 100 years, I will
also speak as beautifully as our elders.
Unless that is too...OLD-fashioned, heh.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Get it? Old? Ahem...{{delay8}} I truly have no flair
for humor. I should have shown more
restraint.

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Now, it is time to clean!


Clean water is the lifeblood of the Zora,
as we live out our days within the waves.

---
label: near0002
---
For the children!

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I wish I could allow the children to play
here in the square,{{delay8}} but I simply cannot
remove the sludge stains.
Do you know what Prince Sidon said when
I told him as much?

With a glorious smile, he said, "While King
Dorephan is away, the children may play
in the {{color id="0"}}throne room{{color id="-1"}}."
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Such kindness! My wife and I were
quite impressed.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This square is usually so filled with the
laughter of children that it's almost
deafening.
That is why I am cleaning the sludge so
fervently. I hope to see that wonderful
liveliness return once again!

---
label: 0022
---
Where's the king?

---
label: 0023
---
See you later.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}He is off investigating the sludge.


Without its master, his throne room
was quiet and somewhat miserable...
but that is no longer the case.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}My children are even now running wild in
there, pretending to be King Dorephan.

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Now, it is time to clean and then clean
some more!

After all, clean water is the lifeblood of
the Zora, as we live out our days within
the waves.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I am so weary...{{delay8}} I cannot wait to eat.


I wonder what kind of fish Mei
caught for us today...

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh, those yummy fish that Mei brings
home...{{delay15}} Mmm... {{delay8}}I start drooling just
thinking about them!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}The Hyrule bass that Mei caught
was...{{delay8}}exquisitely fatty! Truly succulent!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}She delivered it freshly caught.{{delay15}} Sure, it is
by no means an uncommon fish, but the
freshness made all the difference.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I am so happy that my treasured wife is
a master of fishing!

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The only thing I can boast about is that I
am lucky enough to have Mei as my wife.{{delay8}}
She fills my heart, as well as my stomach!

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Today I am once more going to try my
best to fix up the domain.

---
label: near0006
---
No worries... Stay positive!

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Link!{{delay15}} I am so grateful to you for finding
my beloved Mei!

I believe she finally learned her lesson.
She likely won't give in to overconfidence
after all that has transpired.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Well... {{delay8}}For a while, anyway.{{delay8}} Heh.

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Now that the sludge is gone, the fish
have returned.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}And my dear wife, Mei, is elated now
that she can work again for the first time
in a while. She caught some tasty fish!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}We sell some of what we catch to the
general store, so you should swing by
if you have the time.

---
label: talk0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}l intend to persuade Mei to stay nearby.
My heart cannot stand any more worry!

That said, who knows how long my
persuasions will last...

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Now that the sludge is gone and we can
catch fish again, it finally feels like things
are returning to normal.

---
label: near0008
---
I should wrap up.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I didn't realize the time. I should call it
quits soon.

---
label: near0009
---
Heh!

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I cannot believe I have been gifted the joy
of watching my children sleep and talking
to my lovely wife again.
Our gratitude is beyond words, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}On evenings when I am worn down from
work, {{delay8}}I delight in relaxing with my family.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I hope that we can enjoy days like this for
as long as we live.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I am so glad that my children did not fall
victim to that detestable sludge.

Yaaawn.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}I must rest soon.
