{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm drawing up a special menu for those
out scavenging for food or investigating.{{pageBreak}}Ingredients are hard to come by in this
blizzard, but we'll be fine if we get a little
creative with our cooking.{{pageBreak}}With the right ingredients, a little food
can go a long way.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}For example, a pinch of {{color id="0"}}spicy pepper{{color id="-1"}}
warms you up so you don't notice the
cold so much.{{pageBreak}}We do not have many of them here, but
you are welcome to what's available.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}In tough situations like this, everyone
needs to look out for each other and
help where we can.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}When you cannot take any more of this
cold, I recommend snacking on food
made with a pinch of {{color id="0"}}spicy pepper{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}We do not have many here, but you are
welcome to what's available.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I am so relieved that the blizzard stopped.
Thank you, Link, truly.{{pageBreak}}Now everyone can return to their normal
lives back in the village.{{pageBreak}}I plan to join them as soon as I have
finished straightening up in this lodge.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Once I finish tidying up around this lodge,
I shall rejoin the others in the village.{{pageBreak}}I owe it to the children to cook their
favorite dishes. It is the least I can do
after all their help around the village.
