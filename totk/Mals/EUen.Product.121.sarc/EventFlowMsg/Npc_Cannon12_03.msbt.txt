It isn't working...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sorry. This Skyview Tower is out of order{{delay15}}
and maintenance is proving tricky.

What's wrong?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}OK,{{delay8}} goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Well, {{delay8}}the terminal that starts up the
Skyview Tower isn't working.

I've checked all the terminal's parts,{{delay8}}
but nothing looks broken.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I wonder if something to do with the
tower itself is broken.

How in Hyrule?!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I came to repair this Skyview Tower, but
the terminal hasn't been working.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Until now! It started working again...{{delay8}}even
without me doing anything!

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}The terminal! It's working again!{{delay15}} Even
though I didn't do anything...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh?!{{delay8}} There was something blocking the
top of the Skyview Tower?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hmm. The terminal and the lid on top
of the tower are connected...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So if the lid wouldn't work because it
was blocked, {{delay8}}I guess the terminal
wouldn't work either.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well. {{delay15}}I'm in a hurry, and everything seems
to be working properly, {{delay8}}so I'll head out.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thank you for fixing the Skyview Tower.
I'm off!
