{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Y'know...you look an awful lot like Link...

label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Y'know...{{delay15}}you look an awful lot like
Master Kohga's archenemy, Link!

label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Or at least your blasted blond hair does!
Listen, you do know why we wear
uniforms, right? To look UNIFORM!
When you think of the Yiga Clan emerging
from the shadows, you think of them as
a fearsome, largely identical unit!
I mean, yeah, OK, some of us are a bit
bulkier than others, but that Link-like hair
of yours sticks out like a sore thumb!
{{anim type="Angry_00"}}So, y'know what? I'm not gonna let you
in here! At least, not until you learn how
to fall in line!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Get yourself to our training ground on top
of that tower.

They'll teach you how to act right!

label: Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughBad"}}Make it through our training, and I guess
I'll let you in.

If you come back alive, that is!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry"}}Listen, fancy-pants! Those golden locks of
yours stand out. We Yiga are supposed to
sneak around. See the problem?
But if you really want to get in here
that badly...

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Or at least your hair does! Our clan's
whole thing is being mysterious and
monolithic, and buddy, you stand out.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Well, as long as you can earn your keep,
I suppose I can ignore the Link look.{{delay15}}
We are really short on hands.
Anyway, hurry on in.

label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi_00"}}I can't believe you made it through our
training in one piece...

{{anim type="Understand_00"}}OK, fine, you've proved your worth.{{delay15}} I still
don't approve of the hair, but we're short
on hands, so I can overlook it.
Hurry on in.
