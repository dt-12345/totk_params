{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aha! ♪I know that face! Yes, that's a
face I know!♪

Have you come to meet another
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Bare skin is so dull. Liven yourself up!

label: Talk0013

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}If you keep distracting me, I won't be
able to conduct properly!

And without my conducting, the players
won't know what to do!

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Er? {{delay8}}How odd. {{delay8}}They're going on without me.{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="-1"}}W-well, never mind, then. {{delay8}}Are you that
interested in the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy Cotera{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} here hasn't been seen
outside of her flower bud lately.{{pageBreak}}She was fond of the way {{color id="0"}}Beetz plays his
drum{{color id="-1"}}, so perhaps she'd be cheered up by
hearing him again. If only he was here...{{size value="80"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There was that traveler who {{color id="0"}}heard a drum{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere... Where was that again?

Maybe near {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}to the north...where
the road bends around Bonooru's Stand?{{size value="100"}}

Great Fairy?

---
label: Talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, I must be mistaken.


I merely assumed because the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy
Cotera {{color id="-1"}}is such a notable attraction to
Dueling Peaks Stable.

---
label: Talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Alas, the local {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} hasn't emerged
from her flower bud in quite some time.

I'm sure she's scared to come out, just
like the Great Fairy at Woodland Stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}She used to listen to {{color id="0"}}Beetz's drum{{color id="-1"}}
so fondly...

Hearing his lively beat again will be just
the thing to cheer her up,{{delay8}} but...

label: Talk0023

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Beetz simply...{{delay8}}isn't here.

---
label: Talk0007

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Beetz{{color id="-1"}} is a young drummer who plays
for the Stable Trotters.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But one day he took his leave from the
troupe. We haven't seen him since.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh, there was that traveler who {{color id="0"}}heard a drum{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere... Where was that again?

the road bends around Bonooru's Stand?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Say! Might you happen to be going in
the direction of {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}A traveler told me about {{color id="0"}}hearing a drum{{color id="-1"}}
between here and there—oh, yes, and
much closer to there!{{delay8}} Could you go look?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh, never mind me...{{delay8}} I shouldn't impose
on you like that.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes, goodbye...


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait, goodbye?! But we only just
said hello!

No goodbyes for you until I tell you
about the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy Cotera{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, there's the man of the hour! Look at
this—{{delay8}}or rather, listen!{{pageBreak}}It's Beetz! {{delay8}}Our stalwart drummer, Beetz,
has returned!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}A sorry troupe leader I am, making my
band members worry about me that way.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}What they really ought to be worried about is our
declining audience.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}But! The beating heart of the Stable
Trotters {{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}pulses once more! Three cheers
for our own Beetz!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm brimming over with happiness to the
point that I can't keep a lid on it!{{pageBreak}}And I must say, it's good to see a friendly
face, one who no doubt shares my
concern for the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yo! If the bridge is no good, how about we
{{color id="0"}}cross the river{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}♪That's right!♪ We can {{color id="0"}}cross the river{{color id="-1"}}!


To the {{color id="0"}}river{{color id="-1"}}, everyone! All together now!

label: Talk0011

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm sure the Great Fairy will give you her
blessing when she wakes up.

If you have the time, I'd be honored if you
could be there for our performance!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The bridge to the Great Fairy is broken.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}How are horses supposed to cross?

---
label: Talk1001

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The bridge is a bust, but I thought it might
not be so hard to {{color id="0"}}cross the river{{color id="-1"}}. I see
now that I was mistaken!{{pageBreak}}Even if we took off our Breezer's wheels
and floated across the river, the current
would run that plan aground.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The Great Fairy is so near, yet so far!
I have absolutely no idea what to do.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is over there.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The bridge is no use at all.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Our Breezer was built for traveling roads,
not rivers.{{pageBreak}}If we tried to ford it, we'd all sink before

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can play my drum all I want, but this
current won't be swayed.{{pageBreak}}Isn't there anything we can do?

---
label: Talk1010

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm starting to question whether it was
a good idea to remove our Breezer's
wheels after all.{{pageBreak}}There must be some way to ride if we
can't wheel around, but I can't think
of anything.

---
label: Talk1011

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We're so close I can taste it.{{pageBreak}}But even a strong horse can't swim
