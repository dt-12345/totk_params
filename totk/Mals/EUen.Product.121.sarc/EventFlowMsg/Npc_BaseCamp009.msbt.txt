{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Link.{{delay15}} Right?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You really are that Link guy, aren't you?
I heard folks talking about you, and your
face matches the one on the poster.
Oh, sorry.{{delay8}} You wanted a bed, {{delay15}}yeah? You
can go ahead and take whatever empty
bed you like.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Nappin's sleep talking is particularly
audible here, so you probably want a
bed a little farther from him.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}His physical condition has been
deteriorating ever since he investigated
one of the {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}...
That's despite how long he's been back,
which has been quite a while. He still
hasn't made much of a recovery.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, sorry.{{delay8}} You wanted a bed, {{delay15}}yeah? You
can go ahead and take the bed next to
this one.
A bunch of people are out {{color id="0"}}investigating
the fallen ruins{{color id="-1"}} right now, so there's a
free bed available.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sorry.{{delay8}} I'm using this bed. But feel free to
grab another empty bed.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sorry.{{delay8}} I'm using this bed, so if you want to
rest, go ahead and use the next one over.

Everyone's up above, {{color id="0"}}investigating the
fallen ruins{{color id="-1"}} right now, so there are plenty
of beds for resting.

label: Talk_1_4

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you're going to use a bed, feel free to
use the empty one over there.

It's far enough from Nappin, in theory, so
you won't be constantly annoyed by his
sleep talking.
He zonked out after an investigation into
the {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_1_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you're going to rest, just use one of the
free beds.

It's hectic with the investigation into the
{{color id="0"}}fallen ruins{{color id="-1"}}, and there are available beds,
so it's a good time to get some rest in.

The chasms?

---
label: Talk_1_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The Upheaval created massive openings
across the land known as chasms.

In fact, there's one nearby just beneath
Hyrule Castle and another to the south
of Lookout Landing.
But if you go plumbing those Depths,
you'll come across plenty of {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}...

You touch that stuff, and your health will
take a turn for the worse.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Anyway, there's a young girl named Josha
who's been heading up investigations into
the chasms.
Despite her age, she's been leading the
charge—pretty remarkable, if you ask me.

Fallen ruins?

label: Talk_1_18

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Huh? Didn't you see it up above?{{delay8}}


A big Zonai ruin fell into Lookout
Landing's pond.

Hudson Construction happened to be on
standby at just the right time—{{anim type="Ease_00"}}they and
the research team are handling the mess.
When it landed, there was a terrible crash
that shook the whole Emergency Shelter.
There was quite the uproar for a while...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Thankfully things are calmer now, but until
we know what caused it, we can't fully
relax yet.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You're welcome to rest or use any of the
resources you see here.

Purah's made it the standard policy that
anyone who needs shelter here has it.
She says it's what Zelda would want.

label: Talk_1_5

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}All the resources here are free for use,
so don't be shy.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This may be our first time meeting, but
I'd recognize that face anywhere. You're
famous, after all.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah...{{delay8}} Were you {{delay15}}going to use the pot?
Please, feel free to anytime.

Burmano was on duty here, but he went
to {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}} and never came back.

So it's my job to watch the fire here in
his place.

label: Talk_1_12

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Link, you've got to hear me out.


Burmano—the guy in charge of cooking—
went to {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}} and NEVER
came back.
Thanks to him, I'm stuck here on fire duty.
Maybe forever.

Hyrule Castle?

label: Talk_1_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, when I say Hyrule Castle, I don't
mean somewhere dangerous like the
chasm near there or anything.
Specifically, he went to Hyrule Castle's
{{color id="0"}}dining hall{{color id="-1"}}.

Some folks investigating the chasms told
him about some super-special {{color id="0"}}recipe{{color id="-1"}} in
the dining hall, so he left—just like that.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Well, he wouldn't do anything risky,
so I'm not too worried about him.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Still, he's sure taking his time coming
back, so I guess I am a little worried...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Well, he wouldn't do anything dangerous,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If he's not back to eat his meal, though,
I might start to worry.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Well, he wouldn't do anything dangerous,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But he's the kind of person who loses
track of time when he gets engrossed in
things, so I do wonder when he'll be back.

---
label: Talk_1_8
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I mean, he's not the sort to take wild
risks, but I will say that place isn't without
its dangers.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Eh, he'll probably be fine?
