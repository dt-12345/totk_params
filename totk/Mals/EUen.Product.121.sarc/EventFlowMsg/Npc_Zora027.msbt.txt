I must not falter...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Well now... {{delay8}}Your journey here must have
been difficult. Were you not daunted by
the sludge outside?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We are not presently graced with King
Dorephan's presence, and so we are
making use of the throne room.
The sludge cannot fall in here. It is safe!


{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hurry along!{{delay8}} Take shelter beneath the
safety of this roof for a while!

---
label: talk0030

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The sludge cannot fall in here. It is safe!
You should rest for a while.

label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Great work washing away that nasty
sludge. {{delay8}}Thanks to you, {{delay8}}we are saved.

Now it is my turn to play the hero...{{delay8}}
I am off on a quest to acquire more
splash fruit!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Lady Yona finds said quest worrisome.{{delay8}}
However, despite how I may appear, I was
once known as the master of the spear!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}This is the perfect opportunity to retrain
my legs and hips so that all can see I am
still the master of old!

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You may have beaten me to it, but I must
do whatever I can to help the domain!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}One must strike while the iron is hot,
and it is currently ablaze! I am heading
out in search of more splash fruit!

---
label: near0006
---
Splash fruit! Splash fruit!

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}All of the splash fruit near the domain
has already been picked...{{delay15}}but there must
be some where no one has yet ventured.
The road on the south side of the domain
has been crumbling due to the Upheaval,
so the search team hasn't checked there.

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There may be splash fruit still to find,
perhaps where no one has yet ventured.

The road south of the domain is crumbling
due to the Upheaval. The search team
has surely not checked there yet.

King Dorephan?

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You want to know about King Dorephan?{{delay15}}
I believe he left to investigate the sludge.

But I have seen no sign of him in this area
of the domain. If you are looking for him,
seek elsewhere.

Goodbye!

label: talk0018

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Cleff from the general store is in quite a
bind as well... I must bring back plenty of
splash fruit!

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}I did it! I acquired splash fruit!


I gave a bunch to Cleff at the general
store.{{delay8}} They should be on his store's
shelf by now.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}With this,{{delay8}} I am hoping that it will become
easier to take care of everyone!

---
label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you want some splash fruit as well,
try stopping by the Coral Reef.

Another odd occurrence!

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I was concerned about Prince Sidon,{{delay8}} and
so I began climbing upward to go check
on him.
However, now there is a mysterious light
at East Reservoir Lake!

{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It is just one odd occurrence after another
these days.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There is a mysterious light at
East Reservoir Lake.{{delay15}} I wonder
if Prince Sidon has noticed...

---
label: near0009
---
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oof! My back!


{{anim type="Work_00"}}Ahem. I mean, this pain is nothing at all!{{delay8}}
I must go and check on how Prince Sidon
is doing.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I may be far along in years, {{delay8}}but I am still
Trello, the Spear of Justice!{{delay8}} I shall protect
the prince at all costs!

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}Just a little farther...until I finally reach
Mipha Court.

{{anim type="Work"}}Oh, back of mine...{{delay8}} I am begging
you...{{delay15}} Please, hold strong until I
reach the prince!

label: near0001

*pant* *cough*

---
label: near0011

I am taking a short break.

---
label: near0012
---
Phew...

---
label: talk0001

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I had prepared myself that we may have
to live with the sludge for another one
hundred years or so.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}In this instance, I am happy to have so
massively miscalculated. The young ones
have saved us all!
I am, of course, speaking about our brave
King Sidon. However...

My son, Rivan, and my granddaughter,
Dunma, have also become so dependable.
They are like brand-new Zora!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I cannot allow them to take all of the glory
for themselves! I will train until I return to
form, starting with these legs of mine!

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Although a new age has dawned...{{delay8}}I have
no plans to retire anytime soon.

{{anim type="Work_00"}}It would be shameful for a Zora warrior to
let a silly thing like age stop them.

The older you get, the craftier your spear
movements become.{{delay15}} I have not yet neared
the limits of my abilities!

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I plan to focus on training my legs and
hips. The trappings of age can go straight
to the depths of eternity, for all I care!
Though I am an elderly soldier, my heart
and my muscles are still young.{{delay8}} I would
not even lose to a 200-year-old hatchling!

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It is fortunate that this place survived the
panic surrounding the sludge.

Still, Ledo was quite worked up
about all of the damage. It certainly is
in dire need of repair.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}He was in a rather excited state when he
left to look for materials at East Reservoir
Lake.{{delay8}} I hope he finds what he needs.

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The stonemason, Ledo, ran all the
way to East Reservoir Lake with such
speed and ease!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I cannot allow him to get away with that!{{delay15}}
I must train my legs until I surpass him!

---
label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}*cough* *wheeze* I am exhausted!

label: talk0020

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}*wheeze* *hack* It seems it is time...
for this warrior...to take a little break.
