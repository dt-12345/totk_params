{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Argh, it never ends! How many times must
I go back and forth between the Depths
and the surface?!
Between this, that, and the other thing,
all of this is {{color id="0"}}Link{{color id="-1"}}'s fault!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hmm, nah... It wouldn't be any fun to kill
{{color id="0"}}Link {{color id="-1"}}right away...

Maybe I'll make him lug all this stuff to
{{color id="0"}}the Depths {{color id="-1"}}and back for me... Work him
till he kicks the bucket. That'll show him!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}You're kidding, right? {{delay15}}Link is Zelda's
appointed swordsman!

He's always getting in our way every
chance he gets. The guy's a real pain.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But not for long. The Yiga is tightening its
net all over Hyrule. {{delay8}}I'm sure we'll hear
news of his death any day now.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heh heh...{{delay8}} He'll never expect that we're
{{color id="0"}}disguising ourselves as trees{{color id="-1"}} to ambush
him. He's done for!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The only way Link could ever beat Master
Kohga is with a cowardly surprise attack!{{pageBreak}}If that's how he does things, we'll pay him
with a surprise attack of our own.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}There's no way he knows we're {{color id="0"}}disguising
ourselves as trees{{color id="-1"}} to ambush him.
He's done for!
