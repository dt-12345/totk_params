A voe?!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Even though I know the chief has given
you permission to be here...

I just can't relax with a voe around.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Don't...{{delay8}}stand too close to me.
My instincts might kick in, and I'd cut
you down without even thinking.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If the monsters get through here, it's a
straight shot to the shelter...

No matter what happens, I won't let
anything break through here!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've seen my share of unexpected things
ever since I became a soldier...

But... Sa'oten! To think I would see the
day a voe was allowed to come and go in
town as they please!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Don't...{{delay8}}stand too close to me.


I know that you're allowed to be here,
but instinct might kick in and I may cut
you down without even thinking.
