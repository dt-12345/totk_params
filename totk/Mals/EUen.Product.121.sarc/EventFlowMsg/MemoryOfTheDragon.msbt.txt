{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}There doesn't seem to be any danger at
the moment.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I wonder... What is this place?


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There are so many images here that
resemble the giant pictures now found
on the surface of Hyrule.
Could it be that this place is somehow
connected to the ones who left those
pictures behind?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wonder... What is this place?


Is it somehow connected to those who
left those giant pictures everywhere?

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}The images here do seem to be
a reflection of the geoglyphs.

There may even be Dragon's Tears
present at the other geoglyphs, just like
the one you already found.
If you intend to investigate the geoglyphs,
courageous one, perhaps you should
somehow make a {{color id="0"}}copy{{color id="-1"}} of the map.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}The literature hints that something related
to the geoglyphs can be found within the
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.
The temple is at the bottom of a canyon
in Hebra. I suggest you steel yourself, and
then go and seek it out.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Ahhh. This place...

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Lady Impa, let's head down. We must
investigate up close...

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}There, upon the walls...{{delay8}}


Are those not...{{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}?! {{delay15}}Hm.
What could this mean?

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Hm. {{delay8}}I believe the one we saw first was the
geoglyph on the left edge of the wall.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As for the next painting...

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}According to the floor map, it is near
{{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It seems the locations of the other
geoglyphs from the wall are marked
on the {{color id="0"}}floor map{{color id="-1"}} as well.

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I can hardly believe what my eyes behold.{{delay8}}
Who could have guessed this old ruin still
held such secrets?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It is said that the geoglyphs appeared all
over Hyrule during the Upheaval when
Princess Zelda went missing.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hm. How are they connected to these
images here...

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}There is no time to dawdle! Let us hurry
and investigate the remaining geoglyphs.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh! L-Lady Impa...{{delay8}} Perhaps you should
rest a bit before such a trying journey.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Link, if you happen to see a geoglyph
during your travels, I urge you to
investigate this matter as well.
If more strange visions are waiting at the
other geoglyphs, {{delay8}}just like the one you
already experienced, well...
Perhaps they will provide clues that could
lead us to Princess Zelda.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! Link! I am so pleased that you've
come here as well.

label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}To be honest, Lady Impa deduced that
there is {{color id="0"}}something related to the
geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} here.
It took some effort for us to get up here,
but we managed it.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But then Lady Impa grew impatient.{{delay15}} The
moment I took my eyes off her, she went
deep into the temple all by herself.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Once I finish mooring the balloon, I plan
to hurry after her.

Lady Impa...

Where could it be...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, Link! Thank you again for your help
with the balloon.

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}However, I am surprised you feel
comfortable walking about in such
a state of undress...
You have always been so fearless...or
perhaps I should say reckless.

---
label: Talk_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}However, I am surprised that you see fit
to walk around wearing such a thing.
It disturbs me to see you like that.
Although, I suppose that if you dress like
those lost souls, perhaps they will decline
to pick a fight with you.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I believe there is {{color id="0"}}something related to the
geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} somewhere within this temple.

I am searching, but so far, it has been in
vain. The chambers here are enormous,
so it will be a difficult task at best.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Where could it be...

---
label: Talk_22

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Link, I have been wondering...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The geoglyph in {{color id="0"}}southern{{color id="-1"}} Hebra...{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} in the Forgotten Temple...
We intend to go on a journey to visit
the geoglyphs it has depicted.
However, it was quite a bit of work to
copy down that map.

If only we'd had a {{color id="0"}}picture-capturing{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}tool{{color id="-1"}}
to make quick work of the task...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Ah, Link! Are you making progress in your
investigation of the geoglyphs?

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}I see... So the Dragon's Tears were shed
by Princess Zelda when she transformed.{{delay15}}

And the geoglyphs were drawn by an
ancient people who touched those
memories and saw visions, as you did.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Perhaps in the past they were more
attuned to that sort of thing than the
people of today.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hm... {{delay15}}I understand now.{{delay15}} So that is the
truth of it all.

Link. {{delay15}}If all of the memories you saw are
true, then that means...

Since our Princess Zelda has become the
Light Dragon, she can never again return
to her original form.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}It is...painfully tragic.{{delay15}} Our dear
Princess Zelda...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}No. It cannot be!{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}There must be a way...some method to
restore Princess Zelda to her former self.

Link, I will return to Kakariko Village and
review the ancient literature once more.

That is the most I can do to help
Princess Zelda...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Link! Have you made any progress in

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you have any new information, can you
please share it with Lady Impa at once?
