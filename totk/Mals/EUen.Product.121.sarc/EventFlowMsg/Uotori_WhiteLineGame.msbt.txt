{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Being in a tent was kinda fun—like having

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}After the pirates tore down our house,
we had to go live in a tent.

It was actually kinda fun—like having a

we're back home.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Y'know, mister, everyone's calling you

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I thought this'd be a good time to look.
Y'know, morning, when the water's all
sparkly and see-through...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I was hoping the sun would make it easier
to spot... Weird!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I was sure I'd find it today, but I ran out
of time. Gotta eat dinner.

Blue shirt?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's Dad's favorite thing.{{pageBreak}}He loves it so much, he put it in an
{{color id="0"}}iron chest{{color id="-1"}} so nobody'd take it.{{pageBreak}}But I checked everywhere, and I couldn't
find the chest.{{pageBreak}}I think those pirates sank it. So it's
probably in the bay, since it's too heavy
to float away.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Dad's pretending like he doesn't mind,
but I bet he's really sad it's gone.{{pageBreak}}I gotta get it back!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wish I could search for it now, but I gotta

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Where's that {{color id="0"}}iron chest {{color id="-1"}}with Dad's
{{color id="0"}}blue shirt{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}It's heavy, so if it sank in the ocean,
it should still be {{color id="0"}}in the bay {{color id="-1"}}somewhere.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Dad's pretending like he doesn't mind,

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}So that's what you two were doing on
the beach all day—looking for this?
I thought you were out playing!{{pageBreak}}Gosh. Thanks for finding this, guys.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}And you! Rebuilding houses, finding

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}And you! Saving villages, finding
lost items...

What can't you do?

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}My trusty blue shirt... {{delay8}}When I was a
young man, I used to wear it all the time.

But I haven't put it on since the boys'
mom started picking out my clothes.

Seems a shame to keep that beauty in a
moldy old chest though... {{delay8}}Say, would you
want it?

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Whaaa? But, Dad, weren't you sad about
your shirt?

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Well, yeah... The one I'm wearing! I was
eating soup, and I got a big stain on it.

I thought it was ruined.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}But then Mommy got rid of the stain,
so it's good as new!

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Oh, so...all this time, we were worried
about the wrong shirt?

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wrong shirt! Wrong shirt!

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Afraid so, kiddo.{{delay30}} But I am grateful you did
all that for your old man!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Honestly, I can't believe how fast you
two are growing up.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_01"}}You make your dad proud, you know that?{{delay8}}
Very, very proud.
