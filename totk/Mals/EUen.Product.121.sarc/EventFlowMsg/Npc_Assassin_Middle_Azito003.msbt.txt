{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}That brand-new gear...


I'd heard talk of a potential new member.
I take it that's you.

I can hardly believe how quickly you
managed to visit all three branches...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Impressive, {{delay15}}to say the least.


This hideout is the linchpin of the Yiga
Clan's subterranean expansion.

It's where we train our members, develop
our special vehicles, and do whatever else
needs doing.
That's it for the explanation. You'll figure
things out if you keep your eyes open.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That brand-new gear... I take it you're
the new guy?

You're lucky to even be alive with our
archnemesis Link out there scheming
to bring us down.
But no matter how cunning he is, he'll
never infiltrate this hideout!

So don't worry about him. Worry about
developing vehicles and training troops.

Here, we train our members, develop our

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}But I've told you all of this before! Get
moving already!

{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}You look like you want to say something.{{delay30}}
I take it you're worried that Master Kohga
is gone?{{delay15}}
Hmph. That IS what a newbie would think.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Just as the Yiga Clan is immortal, so, too,
is Master Kohga!{{pageBreak}}That you'd dwell on such an insignificant
thought shows that you lack training!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}That fearless demeanor... I heard you had
promise, but didn't think you'd earn your
place, let alone rise to blademaster.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}{{size value="125"}}A splendid feat.{{size value="100"}}


But don't let your title bloat your ego.
Stay faithful to the cause with a sharp
blade and a silent heart.
I imagine you're well acquainted by now,
but this hideout is the linchpin of the Yiga
Clan's subterranean expansion.
It's where we train our members, develop
our special vehicles, and do whatever else
needs doing.
I hope you'll find this place can serve you
as well as you can serve it. We're grateful
to have you, blademaster.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That fearless demeanor...{{delay15}} You must be the
one they're all talking about. The new
recruit who became a blademaster.
Our nemesis, Link, has been foiling our
plans, so it's heartening to have a
powerful new warrior among our ranks.
With you as its cornerstone, this hideout
is going to be invincible! Let's see Link
try getting in here now!
