Sidon, my cherished kin.

label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_001_b

That voice again.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_002_b
---
You're the one we've been hearing this whole time?

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_003_c
---
Indeed. I am your ancestor from a time long past.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_004_b
---
I served the first King of Hyrule as a Zora warrior and
a sage who, like you, could direct the flow of water.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_005_b
---
You are the pride of the Zora. Your fluid, graceful
movements as you fight... I would expect nothing less
from my descendant.

You bested the monster that sullied our domain, but it
was a servant of a greater evil—the Demon King.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_007_b
---
His true purpose was to prevent you from obtaining
the stone that you just found—my secret stone.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_008_b
---
That stone that you are wearing?

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_009_b
---
Yes. And it is important you know more about the
stone and the Demon King.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_010_c
---
So listen closely to what I have to say.

---
label: DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_012_b

It concerns the Imprisoning War and the destiny of
our people.
