{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The caves around here are a good place
to duck out of the cold, {{delay8}}but be careful of
lurking monsters.{{pageBreak}}Some of them have pools of freezing
water, too, on top of the normal cold.
Always stay alert for danger.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Well, look who it is! Thanks for bringing
me those chillshrooms.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I would've been so embarrassed coming
back with nothing to show for it. You
really helped me save face!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now that my wing's healed, I'm patrolling
the village, checking for signs of damage
from the blizzard.
The snow has stopped now, but that stuff
was piled up everywhere for a long time.
There might be lasting damage.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}What if the bridge gives way while
somebody's walking on it? I can't let
that happen!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Notts is helping out too. I gotta say,
for a kid, she's a pretty good patroller.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Notts and I are patrolling the village
together. We haven't noticed too much
damage, which is good.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I won't give the all-clear for kids
to start running around yet. Not until I'm
sure it's safe!
