H-he's standing!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}President Hudson!{{delay15}} Are you OK?!

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}How's the president standing?!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Did you do that?!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks! Who knew there was such a
clever way to offer a helping hand!

---
label: Talk52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}President Hudson, {{delay8}}now you can stand
just fine without my support!

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Still, thanks to you, I don't need to
support this sign anymore.

label: Talk27

{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh no...{{delay8}} What have I done?!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk26

{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}{{size value="80"}}All right...{{delay15}} I'm sorry, President Hudson! {{delay8}}I won't
let you fall over again!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That was unforgivable!{{delay15}} It's all your fault,
startling me like that!

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Yes, I know it's just a sign. But I have
great respect for President Hudson!
So, I pin the blame on you...
{{size value="125"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Un-for-givable!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0005
---
President Hudson?

---
label: Talk44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You haven't heard about Mr. Hudson?!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}He's the president of our construction
company! He's THE one appointed by
THE princess herself!

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}She placed him in charge of putting those
material caches everywhere. And now he's
shouldering Hyrule's restoration!

---
label: Talk55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}She placed him in charge of putting the
material caches all over Hyrule. And now
he's shouldering the land's restoration!

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Of course, he is also the founder of
Hudson Construction, and besides
all that...

---
label: 0004
---
Sorry, what's all this?

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! {{delay8}}I'm right in the middle of President
Hudson's epic tale of heroism!{{delay15}}

Well, fine. {{delay8}}What was I doing before?
I don't want the others getting jealous,
so I haven't spread this around...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}But President Hudson gave me an
extra-special mission.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}And that's to put up these signs all over
the place to let everyone know that
Hudson Construction is a big deal.
These aren't your ordinary signs, as you
can clearly see.

---
label: Talk63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}These portray Mr. Hudson himself in
detail—noble, glorious detail!

---
label: Talk53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}It's unforgivable for even one of these
to fall over.

---
label: Talk54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}It's unforgivable for even one of these
to fall over, even in rainy weather!

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}And so...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}{{size value="125"}}I've pledged to support him!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}And so...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}{{size value="125"}}I shall continue to support him!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No need to worry that I might suffer in
this cold. I've eaten a special rice ball I
made that helps me withstand it.

---
label: Talk57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No need to worry that I might suffer in

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Don't worry, Mr. Hudson. I'm here for you!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But I can't stand here forever. I've got so
many more signs to spread around!

I don't know what to do...

---
label: Talk65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I really should redouble my support...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, it's you! Thanks for your help earlier.

---
label: Talk60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! You're that guy from before!

---
label: Talk61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm putting President Hudson here too.

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I will give him my full support as always.
No wind or rain will get in my way!

---
label: Talk58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've eaten a special rice ball I made so
this cold weather won't get to me.

label: Talk59

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've eaten a special rice ball I made so
this heat won't get to me.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What is it? {{delay8}}I need to stay focused.
President Hudson might topple over if
I don't give him my full support!
So, er, can you not bother me?

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}President Hudson {{delay8}}is THE visionary who
had material caches placed all over
the land.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Everyone is welcome to use those
building materials. You, too, of course.
Help yourself.
Just remember to say it loud and proud—
"Thank you, Mr. Hudson! Thank you for all
you do!"

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}President Hudson {{delay8}}is the brilliant founder
of Tarrey Town! Be sure to visit if you go
to Akkala.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's such a nice, homey place that you
might not be able to bring yourself
to leave.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}President Hudson {{delay8}}is more or less a genius
when it comes to making anything. Signs
of all kinds? Easy.
You name it, he can make it. Houses, no
problem. Ingeniously detailed figures?
Oh, yes. That too.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}This whole sign, by the way, is my own
work. I'm nowhere nearly as skilled as
President Hudson...
Still, I'm happy with how it turned out!

---
label: Talk41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Ah! What am I doing, blathering on?{{delay15}}
Don't worry, President Hudson! You
have my full attention!

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What?! {{delay8}}Are you going to support him?
All right.{{delay8}} I'll let go!

label: Talk21

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}W-will he be OK? He won't fall?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Ah! {{delay8}}I let go!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That was brilliant! I would have never
thought of it.

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Oh, right! Let's get him secured while
he's still standing!

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Just put this right there... Get that fastened, and...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{size value="125"}}Perfect!{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}With your help, President Hudson is now
standing proudly and firmly in place!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It fills my heart with joy to see him doing
so well on his own.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Take this with my thanks.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Also... You must be hungry after all that
hard work, right? Let me give you a little
something I made myself!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, but I still don't feel like I've thanked
you enough!{{pageBreak}}This is a little something from my premium
collection. A special gift from me to you!

---
label: Talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Oh, but maybe that's not enough?
Here's a little something extra...

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ah, but that hardly conveys my gratitude.
Let me give you this too!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Whoa! {{delay8}}Unforgivable!

---
label: Talk17

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}President Hudson!{{delay8}} I'll support you!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now I can go to other places to put up
more signs!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}And with that, {{delay8}}I'm off!

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Am I—{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}{{size value="125"}}I am! I'm all out of signs!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}I...{{delay15}} I did it! I've finally spread the legend
of President Hudson all across the land!

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But it wasn't just me. I couldn't have done
it without you!{{pageBreak}}No matter where I found myself, you were
there to keep President Hudson—{{delay8}}or his
signs—standing.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}There's no doubt about it—you truly
admire President Hudson!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="2"}}Though still not as much as I do...{{pageBreak}}{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}I'm giving you a very special present to
thank you for all you've done. I'm sure
you'll love it!{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All right! Time to go back to Tarrey Town
and tell Mr. Hudson the good news!

---
label: 0001

Try letting go!

I'll leave you to it.

President Hudson?

President Hudson?!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Ah, it's you!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Thank you for helping me put up all those
President Hudson signs.{{pageBreak}}I meant to get back to town right away,
but I was drawn in by the sweet sounds
of the Stable Trotters.
They're such great performers, I just have
to listen to enough of their music to give
President Hudson a full report!
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}So I'm not slacking off. I'm carrying out
a very important mission!

---
label: 0006

What's with the pose?

---
label: CompTalk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh, my pose?{{delay15}} Truth be told, when I stand
like this...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}{{size value="125"}}I feel completely at ease!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's as if I can feel President Hudson
nearby, watching over me.{{pageBreak}}It also makes me feel like I'm really
supporting the Stable Trotters!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Ha! Don't worry. This time, I can provide
support without your help!

---
label: CompTalk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh, hello. We meet again. Thanks for your
help putting up those signs.{{pageBreak}}The Stable Trotters put on some amazing
performances, so I've been following them
around and listening to them play.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}But it's not just for fun. I've undertaken
this important duty so I can report my
findings to President Hudson!{{pageBreak}}You should get comfortable and take a
listen for yourself.

---
label: CompTalk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? What do you want? {{delay8}}I'm trying to
marvel at President Hudson's—{{pageBreak}}Er, {{delay15}}that is, Bandleader Mastro's rousing
and masterful conducting.{{pageBreak}}So could you not bother me?

---
label: CompTalk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What? What is it? {{delay8}}Can't you see I'm
getting lost in President Hudson's—{{pageBreak}}Er, {{delay15}}I mean, Violynne's beautiful timbre?!{{pageBreak}}So could you not pull me out of the
performance like that?

---
label: CompTalk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What do you want? {{delay8}}My heart is pounding
with President Hudson's—{{pageBreak}}Or rather, {{delay15}}Beetz's thundering percussion!{{pageBreak}}So stop throwing me off my groove!

---
label: CompTalk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Yes? What is it? {{delay8}}I'm busy having my
spirits lifted by President Hudson's—{{pageBreak}}I mean,{{delay15}} by Pyper's jaunty flute playing.{{pageBreak}}So stop dragging me back to earth!

---
label: CompTalk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Why're you bothering me? {{delay8}}I'm all
fired up by President Hudson's—{{pageBreak}}Er, I mean, {{delay15}}by Eustus's wild horn playing!{{pageBreak}}So could you go bug someone else?

---
label: CompTalk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The way they play is so incredible, I almost forget

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What do you think you're doing?!
Listening to the Stable Trotters in such
