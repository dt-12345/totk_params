{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What's going on? {{delay15}}You looking for
someone to talk to?

Hey, that's fine by me. {{delay8}}Let's talk.{{delay15}}

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}One thing that's odd here...{{delay15}} Everyone
keeps talking about cooking.

If I were hungry, I might think they were
rubbing all this food talk in my face.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Not a problem though. I've got some
ingredients now. Maybe I'll use the
cooking pot and make some grub!

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All the talk of cooking here...it's making
my stomach rumble.

Just ate. But I'll eat again, I guess.

---
label: StartPoint_01_3
---
If I go into the field hungry, I might fall on
my face out there, and if that happens,
it's all over. Lights out.
You've gotta eat your three square a day.
That's investigation 101.

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}How about I ask you?{{delay8}} You see a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}
near here?

---
label: 0000
---
Chasm?

---
label: 0001
---
I didn't see one.

---
label: GoalPoint_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You know, a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}—a deep, deep,
deep hole.{{delay8}} Haven't you heard about
those appearing?
These things are SO big, you can't see
bottom. But what's weird about this
chasm is...{{delay8}}I can't manage to find it at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Maybe it's hidden? Maybe chasms aren't
always big? Maybe some are small?

Or maybe...{{delay8}}our world up here is actually
BELOW whatever's down there. So up
here is really under all that.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ha! Never mind. My mind kind of, er, fell
on its face there.

---
label: GoalPoint_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You haven't? Huh.{{delay8}} S'pose you're telling
me to give up looking maybe?

Is that it? Guess I'm just taking advice
from passers-by these days. Guess you're
saying I should quit?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh. That's NOT what you meant? Sorry,
sorry. Really.

S'pose I'll keep on looking, then. Can't
give up yet.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}How goes it? Hmm?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Ah! Don't tell me! Did you see...{{delay8}}maybe
a...{{delay8}} Maybe a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} near here?

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Might be imagining things, but you look
like you're in a hurry.

On rainy days, slopes get slippery, so
you be careful if you go climbing.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Young guy like you? Yeah, you're going
to climb slopes on a rainy day, even if
you might slip and fall to your ruin.
Just be careful, OK?

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Standing out in the open like this, you
really see how the world's changed.{{delay8}}

Not a lot of new stuff gets me all that
excited anymore. I mean, what can beat
RUINS just falling out of the SKY?
But...{{delay8}} A lot of ruins fell on {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}, and they say all
of them are unusual.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Still, unusual is totally usual now. Not
interested. Hey, if it was REALLY weird,
though, I'd be off to see it in a shot.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}They say that a number of unusual ruins
fell near {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. That's {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}
from here.
Looks like the kind of thing that'd interest
you.{{delay8}} Who knows? If it's interesting
enough, I might head there too.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'll just come right out and say what I'm
doing around here—I'm investigating the
{{color id="0"}}Zonai ruins{{color id="-1"}} in this area.
Problem is that SO many ruins fell all
over the place, getting to every one is
taking a LOT of time.
Good thing there's that {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}
built near here. We can use that thing
to blast ourselves high into the sky.
But what do I do once I'm up there?{{delay8}}
Fall, that's what!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}There's no way I'm going to risk that for
the sake of investigating some ruins!

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You can blast yourself high into the sky
using the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} nearby.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You won't catch me doing that.{{delay8}} That sky
is, uh, awful high up there.

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Got a minute?{{delay8}} You, uh, happen to see
a {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}near here?

They say there's one somewhere in this
area. But I've looked AND looked, and
now I doubt there's one at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I bet some fool got his foot stuck in a
hole, got home late, and told everyone
he fell into a chasm. Ugh, people.

---
label: GoRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There's supposed to be a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} here
somewhere. But I've looked all over the
place and can't find it.
I just know someone blew this all out of
proportion. Someone got stuck in a little
hole and cried, "Oh no, chasm!"

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Seems like a number of unusual ruins fell
at {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.

I'm going there to investigate.{{delay15}} But a
traveler type like you might want to check
it out, see the sights, that sort of thing.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sounds like a number of unusual ruins fell
near {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.

I'm headed there for sure. But, uh, not
anytime soon. Young guy like you,
though?{{delay15}} I bet you're going to bolt for it.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You hear this? The {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} they
built nearby got taken over! Yep, it's a
{{color id="0"}}monster lair {{color id="-1"}}now.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Only fair that the monsters should pay
some rent on the place.{{delay15}} But, yeah. Looks
like none of us can use that place now.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sounds like the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}near
here got taken over. Now that thing
is a {{color id="0"}}monster fort{{color id="-1"}}.
That's rough. None of us will be using
that tower for a good, long while.

---
label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been traveling all over the place,
surveying the {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}. They've been
spotted throughout the land.
I had it on good authority that there's
one around here too.

But I've walked as much as I'm going to
walk and still haven't found it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Guess it was on bad authority.{{delay8}} That or
I'm just bad at finding it.

---
label: BackRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}They said a {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} is around here
somewhere, but come on...{{delay8}} Where is
it already?
I've searched and searched. If someone
found that thing, it got itself unfound.
Maybe my information was wrong...

---
label: Near_StartPoint_01
---
I'm hungry...

---
label: Near_GoalPoint_01
---
Where's that chasm?

---
label: Near_RainPoint_01
---
Careful on rainy days...

---
label: Near_Rain
---
Did I get it all wrong?

---
label: Near_Thunder
---
Watch out for lightning...

---
label: Near_GoRange_01
---
What kind of ruins...

---
label: Near_GoRange_02
---
Up is easy. Down is hard.

---
label: Near_GoRange_03
---
Thought the info was solid.

---
label: Near_BackRange_01
---
I'll have to see for myself.

---
label: Near_BackRange_02
---
Goodbye, Skyview Tower.

---
label: Near_BackRange_03
---
That info can't be wrong.

---
label: Near_BeforeMeetPurah_01
---
Lookout's north, y'know.

---
label: BeforeMeetPurah_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hmm? {{delay8}}What's going on?{{delay8}} You lose your
way out here maybe?{{delay8}}

You know {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}},
right?{{delay8}} Just short of that is a place called
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}.
Lots of people and resources are
gathered there these days.{{delay15}} Head there
if you're trying to get your bearings.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You got all that? It's a pretty big deal.{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}...to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: BeforeMeetPurah_01_2
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}You'll find {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}} just before
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}. Head that way
if you want get your bearings.
