It's good to see you doing well.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It's very nice to see you again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Do you remember my son, Tulin?
He's grown taller, though perhaps not
yet grown up.

{{anim type="TuliAngry_00"}}Well, maybe I would if you didn't treat me
like a hatchling all the time!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}As long as you still think you can take on
the world by yourself, you'll always be my
little chick.

{{anim type="TuliHowl_00"}}What, you think I can't? I'm already
fully-fledged, you know!{{pageBreak}}You'll change your tune when I ace
today's scouting trip!

You all can keep wasting your time
treating the {{color id="0"}}Song of the Stormwind Ark{{color id="-1"}}
like it's real, but not me!

{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Listen, you—

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_027

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Unbelievable.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Tulin wants me to let him go find {{color id="0"}}what's{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}causing the blizzard{{color id="-1"}}, and he's having
trouble hearing "no."

He mentioned a song?

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's an old folk song here in Rito Village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Long, long ago, when we faced a different
sort of {{color id="0"}}upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, the village was saved
thanks to {{color id="0"}}a great flying ship{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Or so claims the song that's been passed
down through generations.

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_013
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's a song for children, mind you. Few
adults still parrot it as if it were true.

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_014
---
Still, every now and then, you get reports
among the Rito of a {{color id="0"}}flying ship{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Combine that with the blizzard caused
by this {{color id="0"}}Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, and it seems less
far-fetched.

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_016
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Even if the Song of the Stormwind Ark is
just a children's rhyme, I suspect that
there is something lurking high in the sky.{{pageBreak}}But the air is so turbulent now that no
Rito can fly close enough to look into it.{{pageBreak}}This is why I say we need to make careful
preparations to find the truth, but Tulin...{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}He thinks we cling to that song out
of cowardice.

---
label: Dm_RT_0040_023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But these are Rito matters. You came for
some purpose, yes?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}What?! This is terrible news. So then, not
even Hyrule Castle is safe...{{pageBreak}}If Princess Zelda's disappearance and the
strange phenomena around the world are
related somehow... Hm.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}We Rito would ordinarily love to
contribute to your search.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But this abnormal blizzard shows no sign
of stopping, and food has grown scarce.{{pageBreak}}Everyone I could spare is already out
researching the blizzard or scavenging
for food.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}My husband hasn't been able to leave
the village much since becoming the
village elder.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wish there was something I could do...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah! But maybe I'm not the one you want.
You should try asking {{color id="0"}}Harth{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}My friend Harth has many sources of
information, so he might already have
a lead about Princess Zelda.

You see the {{color id="0"}}two bonfires{{color id="-1"}} out that way?

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}He's in the {{color id="0"}}lodge{{color id="-1"}} near there, if you'd like
to try visiting him.
