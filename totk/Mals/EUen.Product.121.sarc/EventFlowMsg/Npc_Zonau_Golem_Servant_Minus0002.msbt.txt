{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy"}}This was once a busy refinery where a
great deal of zonaite was processed.{{pageBreak}}It is all but abandoned now.{{pageBreak}}I do still have associates here who
process ore and manage schema stones.
You should speak to them.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Greetings.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Thank you for driving out the trespassers.{{pageBreak}}I overheard your conversation. You spoke
loudly enough that it was difficult not to.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The Eastern Abandoned Mine that man
spoke of is most likely the {{color id="0"}}Abandoned
Lanayru Mine{{color id="-1"}}.
It is extremely far from here. {{delay8}}You will not
find stone guideposts to it in this area.{{pageBreak}}I suggest ascending to the surface first.
You may be able to find a chasm leading
there in the region to the east.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are {{color id="0"}}two chasms in the region to
the east{{color id="-1"}} that contain stone guideposts
leading to the Abandoned Lanayru Mine.
I recall a {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}on land in the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru
Wetlands{{color id="-1"}}. There is also one south of there
in a {{color id="0"}}mountain village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}There is one other thing before you

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My associate over there manages
schema stones. {{delay8}}You may want to ask
for one.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Welcome. {{delay8}}This was once a busy
refinery where a great deal of zonaite
was processed.{{pageBreak}}My task here is to manage designs for
mining equipment.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Please hold one moment.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I have confirmed that there is a {{color id="0"}}schema
stone{{color id="-1"}} you do not yet have. {{delay8}}Allow me to
rectify that.

label: talk_0020

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I will also prepare the parts required to
test it via Autobuild.

label: talk_0001

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I hope that the {{color id="0"}}schema stone{{color id="-1"}} I have
provided is useful to you.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I am curious about one other thing.{{pageBreak}}Do you know what Autobuild will do if
you {{color id="0"}}have insufficient parts{{color id="-1"}}?

Tell me!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy"}}Autobuild will not be able to manufacture
an object if any of its component parts
are missing.{{pageBreak}}But {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}} can help with this.{{pageBreak}}You can supplement missing parts
by using {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}} to mimic their form
and properties.{{pageBreak}}Keep in mind that they are temporary
parts created by the Autobuild ability.{{pageBreak}}You cannot use them for other purposes.
They will vanish when you disassemble
the creation they were intended for.{{pageBreak}}I assure you that they are useful despite
these limitations.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I hope that you find your own purpose
for them.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Schema stones{{color id="-1"}} can immediately produce

you have a {{color id="0"}}schema stone{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}These designs are not included in the
