{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hoo hoo! If it isn't Link!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I am glad to see you safe and looking
so well.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As you may have heard, I retired from my
position as elder and entrusted the village
to Teba's leadership.{{delay8}}
Now I spend my days here, at the Flight
Range, helping mold the next generation
of Rito warriors.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I may look like an old fossil now, but I was
quite the warrior in my day! I would have
bested even Teba!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Not so anymore though. {{delay8}}Hoo hoo...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Unfortunately, the equipment here has
been damaged in the blizzard.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I would like to install new training devices,
but there's no telling when I'll be able to
actually do so.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is a meaningful place for the Rito.
I feel a duty to protect it.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}That said, the most these old bones can
really manage is to prevent the Flight
Range from being buried in snow.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That's why I have to keep this fire going.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I designed new training devices, but until
the blizzard subsides, there's no way I'll
be able to test them.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}All I can do is protect this place as best
I can.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But don't worry about me. I have age and
wisdom on my side. Or age, at least.{{delay8}}
Hoo hoo hoo!

label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Spare some thought, though, for Teba
and the villagers.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}They are banding together admirably to
overcome this accursed blizzard. {{delay8}}Yet I
can't help but worry.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}We can only hope the snows thaw soon.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hoo hoo... {{delay15}}That archery set is left over
from past training sessions.{{pageBreak}}It's a shame they're simply collecting
dust, {{delay8}}but I have no other plans for them.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You seem like someone who could put
them to good use, Link. {{delay8}}They're yours,
if you want them.
