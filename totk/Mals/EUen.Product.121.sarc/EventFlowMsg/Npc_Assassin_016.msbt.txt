What IS this ore...

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}BWAH!{{size value="100"}}


D-d-{{delay8}}don't surprise me like that!{{delay8}} How
was I supposed to know you weren't a
Yiga Clan member or something?!
{{size value="80"}}Geez... Practically scared the pants off me.{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Ummm...{{delay8}} So, {{delay8}}are you also here to
investigate {{color id="0"}}the ore in these mineral
deposits{{color id="-1"}}?

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Uwaaah!{{size value="100"}}


Y-y-{{delay8}}you scared me!{{delay8}} You could've been
a Yiga Clan member coming to take my
life, or worse yet, my ore!
{{size value="80"}}Geez... Give a guy a break already. Scary enough
just working down here.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Ummm...{{delay8}} So, {{delay8}}are you also here to
investigate {{color id="0"}}the ore in these mineral
deposits{{color id="-1"}}?

Ore?

...

---
label: talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, this stuff here.

---
label: talk_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, {{delay8}}it looks like you've got some on hand.
{{delay8}}Guess you're no stranger to this stuff.{{pageBreak}}I've never seen this ore on the surface
before, so it's all new to me.

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I mean, that's some pretty weird {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}},
right?{{delay8}} I've never seen it on the surface.

---
label: talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those {{color id="0"}}ore deposits{{color id="-1"}} over there are chock
full of it.

Given the gouged-out terrain and all the
tools and structures we've found...{{delay8}}I think
this place used to be a {{color id="0"}}mine{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's the same for the {{color id="0"}}other huge valleys{{color id="-1"}}
too.{{delay8}} It's just a shame we have no idea
how to use this ore.
But you have no need to know, do you?


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Because right now,{{delay15}} you're looking at the
Yiga who will take you down!

---
label: talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}You have some nerve, trying to ignore me.

---
label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Well, fine!{{delay8}} Because you're about to go
silent as a stone...FOREVER!

---
label: talk_1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Well, hello! Did they send you to
investigate this valley too?

---
label: talk_1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Look, it's {{color id="0"}}full of weird ore deposits{{color id="-1"}}.


Between the gouged-out terrain and the
handmade objects, this must have been
a mine way back when.

---
label: talk_1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Same goes for those {{color id="0"}}other huge valleys{{color id="-1"}}.
Those {{color id="0"}}deposits{{color id="-1"}} must be worth {{delay8}}something.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I just wish we knew what to do with the
ore that comes out of them...

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The valley has evidence of civilization
everywhere.{{delay8}} I have no doubt that it used
to be a mining area.
All the {{color id="0"}}other huge valleys{{color id="-1"}} are the same.
I wonder what value those {{color id="0"}}ore deposits{{color id="-1"}}
really hold...
