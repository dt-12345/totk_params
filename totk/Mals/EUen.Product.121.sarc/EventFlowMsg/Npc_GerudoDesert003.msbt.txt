{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! Are you back to make more ice?
The desert has really heated up today,
hasn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! Are you back to make more ice? You
can't get enough of the cold, can you?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you back to make more ice?

label: talk0011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In that case, I'd like it if you could do the
same as last time...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you are back to make more ice, I'd like

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'm sorry to keep asking for your help over
and over again, but we're still suffering
from a shortage of ice...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}This is looking pretty good, I say!{{delay8}}
I think this can make it to town
without melting!
This bundle of ice is for me, isn't it?

It's all yours!

Ehhh...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarq!{{delay8}} And this is for you! Enjoy!

label: talk0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Feel free to come back and make more
ice, OK? 

Er, but I don't have anything I can give
you as a reward right now...

It wouldn't feel right to accept your help
when I can't repay you, so give me some
time, OK?
You could always visit the spa in Gerudo
Town in the mean—

Oh, wait.{{delay15}} You're a voe, so you aren't
allowed inside Gerudo Town. {{delay15}}Maybe you
could relax at Kara Kara Bazaar instead?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Wait, really? {{delay8}}I'm sorry, for some reason
I just assumed you'd put that together to
give me.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, that's a shame, but OK.


If you put together some ice slabs and
want to give them to me, just let me
know, OK?

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Did you come to make more ice slabs for
me? I appreciate the thought, but I don't
really need ice right now.
And besides, I don't have anything I can
give you as a reward at the moment...

It wouldn't feel right to accept your help

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Are you after the ice that our townspeople
value so highly? You lousy thief...

I'd take you on right here and now, but
I don't want to dirty this place with the
chaos of a fight.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Get out of here before I change my mind!
