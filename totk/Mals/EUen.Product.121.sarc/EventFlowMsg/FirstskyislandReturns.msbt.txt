Great Sky Island as promised.

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}Temple of Time{{color id="-1"}} and the land it sits
upon were once found on the surface of
the world.{{pageBreak}}This has changed. Its land and the lands
surrounding it now float in the sky.{{pageBreak}}There is a reason for this. The hero who
will defeat the Demon King will one day
awaken at this very site.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_01"}}The site must be kept safe from the
Demon King and his followers. {{delay8}}It was
therefore raised high into the skies.{{pageBreak}}The tremendous power of the sages
accomplished this feat long ago.

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That is the story of the Great Sky Island.

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The sages who raised this land into the
sky directed me to give this token to the
one who heard my story.{{pageBreak}}It is now yours.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Do you want to hear the story again?

---
label: 0010
---
Yes. Tell me the story.

---
label: 0011
---
Maybe another time.

---
label: Talk_0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As you wish.

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We have brought you into our confidence.{{pageBreak}}Please take good care of the token I have
given you for completing the ceremony.

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Your feet touched the ground. {{delay8}}Let us
start over.

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Your time is up. {{delay8}}The bell has rung again.{{delay15}}
Let us start over.

---
label: Talk_0032
---
