Tee-hee... Will he come?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Finally! I've been waiting!

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If a pretty lady is in distress, the hero will
arrive to save her. Everyone says so!

So this is entirely expected!

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But, well...that's strange. The hero's
supposed to carry a legendary sword.{{pageBreak}}And you, um, don't have a sword at all.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But...that's strange. The hero is supposed
to carry a legendary sword.{{pageBreak}}And that weapon on your back? It doesn't
look legendary at all. Not even when
I squint.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, I'm just playing around. I know that
the hero isn't real.{{pageBreak}}I mean, the REAL hero would be carrying
the legendary Master Sword, and...{{delay15}}

That sword you have there...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}The M-M-M-Master Sword?!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, you almost had me for a moment
there! That is an amazing sword, of
course, so it took me by surprise.
But there's no way you're running around
with something straight out of a story.
That'd be just too convenient!

label: Talk_0009

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I guess the hero is just a fairy tale.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Me? I've been making outfits for the Yiga
Clan since they kidnapped me.

I mean, I like fashion, but I couldn't even
sew! Did they listen? No, of course not.

It wasn't so bad once I got used to it
though. Honestly, I've been getting a
little attached to the outfits I make.
Attached enough that I don't want to
hand them over to the Yiga Clan, anyway.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This isn't my size, but it might fit you.
Here!{{delay8}} Take it so I can keep it out of their
grimy mitts.

label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Oh. Your pouch is practically bursting.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let me put this in a box so the Yiga Clan
doesn't take it.{{pageBreak}}You can come back to claim it once
you've sorted out your belongings.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Tee-hee! Careful, folks will {{color id="0"}}think you're
part of the Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}} if you wear the
complete set!
But these tights are so nice, a little
coordination of any kind could really
snazz up your look.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Thanks for coming to save me, really.


You might not be the hero, but you are
my prince!

Thank goodness.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah, I didn't even muss my clothes.
These are my favorites, you know!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I was minding my own business when that
monster attacked! Imagine if I had fallen
and torn my clothes. Hmph.

---
label: SavedLv2_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}That monster jumped at me from out of
nowhere! My hat nearly came off and I'd
just gotten it perfect.

label: SavedLv3_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}That could have been really bad!


I was worried for a moment that my
clothes would be COMPLETELY ruined.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}That brute! {{delay15}}I thought my outfit was
done for!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}My prince wouldn't have let this happen...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Owww... That monster knew a good outfit
when it saw one...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Somebody help! Won't somebody think
of my outfit?!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Don't just stand there! My hat's going to
fall off!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}A monster this terrifying... Shouldn't
the hero be here?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'm so very grateful to you!


Take this, a gift to my prince.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, please! {{delay15}}Don't waste your time talking
to me looking like that.{{pageBreak}}Listen, your fashion sense—or lack of
fashion sense—is your own, but...{{pageBreak}}I simply can NOT be guilty by association
of the fashion crimes you're committing
right now.
