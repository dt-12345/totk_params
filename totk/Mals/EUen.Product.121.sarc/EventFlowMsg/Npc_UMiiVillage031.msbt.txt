{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, hey there. You here to check up
on me?

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's nice of you to come all the way to
the construction site.

But I'm all right.


I just hope it inspires Mattison to see her
papa working hard.

Anyway, I've been looking at ways to
make use of the Zonai devices that
have fallen around here.
It's all part of this {{color id="0"}}development project{{color id="-1"}}
I'm doing with the folks of the Zonai
Survey Team.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hope it inspires Mattison to see her

I've partnered up with the Zonai Survey
Team on a{{color id="0"}} project{{color id="-1"}}. I'm trying to come up
with ways to put the Zonai devices to use.

Development project?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The ground around here is really loose.


Sometimes recovering a {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}} or
moving the ruins causes it to {{color id="0"}}collapse{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_0015

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If anything happened to the folks from
{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}, this place would wind up
covered in Zonai ruins.
And it'd be especially awful since
{{color id="0"}}President Yunobo {{color id="-1"}}went out of his way
to help us.
So, no carelessness and no accidents.
Oh, and make real sure you {{color id="0"}}watch{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}where
you step{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry about that. We were having a chat,
and I didn't notice you there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, for starters, those balloons
the Zonai Survey Team is using...
we made them.
You see, there's this Zonai device that
floats when you add heat.

We attach a basket to these things and
then folks can jump in and go for a ride.

And right now, we're working on these
vehicles that use a wheel-like device...
but this device rotates automatically.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Truthfully, we've got the vehicle base
down, but safety and handling is still an
issue. Can't say they're practical yet.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The balloons the Zonai Survey Team uses
are made out of a basket attached to a
Zonai device that floats when heated.
Now we're working on a vehicle that uses
a wheel-like device that rotates by itself.

But...well...there are still a few handling
and safety issues, and that's slowing
down our work on it.

---
label: Talk_0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We set aside the northern end of the
construction site for {{color id="0"}}vehicle development{{color id="-1"}}.

If you're curious about that stuff, chat
with Fernison. She's the survey-team
member in charge over there.
Ah, but you'll have to wait. She's busy
working with some experts we invited
to help out.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We've set aside the northern end of the

Sounds like they've finally found a way to
control the vehicles. That means we can
start testing them out for real.
If you're curious, go chat with Fernison.
She's the survey-team member in charge
of that area.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I admit, hearing about the sand shroud

Of course...someone's going to need to
bring me some pictures to work off of.
