{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, you're the traveler who destroyed
that ore deposit!{{delay8}}

Hee-hee, of course I remember you. Who
could forget a strike THAT impressive?

---
label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Huh. Maybe I'll try building a weapon like
yours for myself!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Maybe I should try making a weapon like
the one you used to have...

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But I'm kinda...{{delay8}}bad at that crafty stuff.{{delay15}}
Plus, isn't it {{color id="0"}}hard to remove something{{color id="-1"}}
once you've attached it?

---
label: 0000
---
It is hard.

---
label: 0001
---
Not really.

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Right? I figured it'd be.{{delay8}} And I'd be really
annoyed if I broke something while trying
to remove it...

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}For real? That's surprising.{{delay8}} I think it'd be
pretty tough for me...{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Oh, but that's right!{{delay8}}


There's a shop called {{color id="0"}}Break-a-Part{{color id="-1"}} in
Tarrey Town! That's just east of here.

They can apparently use their master
craftsmanship to detach anything from
anything! Like they were never attached!

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Ah, sorry.{{delay8}} Just sort of dozed off there.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You always have weapons that I've never
seen before.{{delay8}} Like that one there! Did you
make it yourself?

---
label: 0002
---
I made it.

---
label: 0003
---
I found it.

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Wow. You're good at making things!{{delay8}}
Maybe I'll try to make something too.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}Yeah! I'll work hard and make a weapon to
rival the {{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}}! You'll see!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hmm.{{delay8}} Maybe I'll do some searching too.{{delay8}}
Like, maybe somebody just left the
{{color id="0"}}legendary sword {{color id="-1"}}lying around somewhere!

---
label: 0004
---
Legendary sword?

---
label: 0005
---
You've got this.

---
label: 0006
---
I kind of doubt that.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}How do you not know?!{{delay8}} There's a rumor
that a legendary sword lies hidden
{{color id="0"}}somewhere in Hyrule{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}You don't know?{{delay8}} There's a rumor that a
legendary sword lies hidden somewhere
in the {{color id="0"}}Lost Woods{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm not
great with this stuff, and that's kind of a
lot of pressure...{{delay8}}but I sure will try!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I was just kidding.{{delay15}} Who knows if the
sword's even out there in the first place?

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}If you want to talk, let's do it somewhere
out of the rain!

label: Near00

Rain, huh...
