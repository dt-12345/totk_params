Kara Kara Bazaar is...

Hm... Where to deploy...

label: Talk_21

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hives of monsters have appeared outside
the town walls. It won't be long before
we'll need to deal with this threat.
How should we deploy our forces?
Who should we send and where...

We could spread them out to lightly cover
all the gates. Or maybe a concentrated
force to protect a weakened position?

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}We need to decide who to send where.
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

The spear troops...

The sword troops...

The cannoneer...

Up to you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Where should we deploy them?

The north gate!

The east gate!

The west gate!

Hold this position.

Return to the yard.

Make no changes.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Pairing the spear troops, with their

I see! {{delay8}}That way they can effectively

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Unless you have any specific requests,

we still managed to make it through.

I've never seen Gibdos work together
in such a coordinated way.{{delay8}} It was almost

...Is that even possible? Could they have
a leader?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Everyone in town is grateful for your help
putting things right here. Sarqso.

You know, we'd previously shut down our
training area due to the sand shroud...
Sudrey was thrilled when we reopened it.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm sure she'd welcome you there if you
decided to drop by!

The training area is out near the
{{color id="0"}}Southern Oasis{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're heading there, I'd suggest going
out through the {{color id="0"}}east gate{{color id="-1"}}. You can also
ask the {{color id="0"}}gatekeeper {{color id="-1"}}for help.
