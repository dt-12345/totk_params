Though the Calamity is over, its scars
remain. A mountain of problems stands
before us even as we begin to rebuild.
No matter where I go to offer aid, Link
remains at my side—a kindness that has
taken a visible toll on his clothing.
That's why I've put an order in for a
{{color id="0"}}new and improved Champion's Tunic{{color id="-1"}},
just{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}for him.
I just can't wait to see the look on his
face when I surprise him with it!{{pageBreak}}I'll hide it in the {{color id="0"}}throne room{{color id="-1"}} so he won't
find it until after our investigation.{{pageBreak}}Even he would never expect that the
{{color id="0"}}torches{{color id="-1"}} are the key.
