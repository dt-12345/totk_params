{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I recognize you. You're the voe who
came to our aid in Gerudo Canyon.

Those Gleeok guts you gave us helped put
my husband back on his feet.

In other words, it's thanks to you that we
can enjoy our wedding adventure.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}He and I are looking for endura carrots
now, in hopes of further improving
his health.
They are said to grow around here,
but so far, we haven't found any.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It doesn't bother me much. I think we
both get some pleasure out of searching
for them together.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd heard that this was a place where
endura carrots grew.

But we've scoured this whole area and
haven't found any at all.

Perhaps we had better look around at a
higher elevation.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We haven't found any endura carrots,
but I think my husband and I will continue
poking around here for now.
You might have more luck searching for
them at the top of the mountain though.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We were hoping to find some endura
carrots, but there's nothing we can do
in this rain.
I would hate to put my husband's health
at further risk.

share quiet moments like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Sometimes it's enough to just sit and
enjoy your partner's company.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let's talk over there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's starting to rain, I see.

Where are those carrots?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Also...{{delay15}}I'm sorry to ask this, but are you
in the Yiga Clan?

I've met a lot of people in my life, {{delay15}}and I
make a point not to judge people by how
they look.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}But I don't think you should go into town
with that outfit on.

Unless you want to go to jail.
