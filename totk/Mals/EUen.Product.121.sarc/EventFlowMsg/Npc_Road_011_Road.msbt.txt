{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, did you know?{{delay8}} The owner of this
stable is a twin.

And that's not all.{{delay8}} His younger brother's
children are also twins! It's twins as far as
the eye can see!
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}I just thought of something!{{delay8}} What if the
voe of my destiny turns out to be a twin?{{delay8}}

And what if he and his equally handsome
brother compete for my affections?{{delay15}} Argh!{{delay8}}
I won't know how to choose!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}*sigh*{{delay15}} Listen to me, fantasizing about
love triangles when I can't even find a
decent line segment...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The owner of this stable is a twin,
and what's more, his brother has twin
children of his own. {{delay15}}How fascinating.

label: StartPoint_01_3
---
Hm...{{delay15}} You look bored. Am I boring you?


Well, you're boring me too.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It's fine. Let's both just shut up and enjoy
the music.

---
label: StartPoint_01_4
---
Hm...{{delay15}} You look bored. Am I boring you?


Or perhaps you want me to stop talking so
you can find the musical troupe.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Unfortunately for you, they're not here.
They must be playing at another stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}So, {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}is just down the road.


I've heard that these strange, {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped
ruins{{color id="-1"}} fell all around the village and are
drawing quite the crowd.
I wonder if the voe of my destiny is among
them. Unlikely, but who knows?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}is just down this road.{{pageBreak}}Could this be where I finally meet my
destined voe?

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Rain is such a nuisance in this region.{{delay8}}
It makes my clothes soggy and
uncomfortable.
In the Gerudo Desert, water is useful.
You need to splash yourself with it to
{{color id="0"}}stave off the heat{{color id="-1"}}.
And in the blazing sun, the water
evaporates, which means your clothes
never get damp...

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Though getting rained on is a valuable
experience, it's just so damp and
uncomfortable.
At least in Gerudo, splashing yourself
{{color id="0"}}staves off the heat{{color id="-1"}}. Here, getting wet is
merely a nuisance...

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Go straight ahead down this road to arrive
at {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

I hear large crowds have formed there
since those odd {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins {{color id="-1"}}were
discovered in the area.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There's an off chance that the voe of
my destiny is there too. Perhaps I should
go and find out?

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I hear a large number of people have
gathered in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}to study
the {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
Perhaps I should go and see if the voe of
my destiny is among them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you go {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} up this road, you will find
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}I was thinking of visiting to try to find the
voe of my destiny.{{pageBreak}}But ever since those mysterious,
ring-shaped ruins fell from the sky,
I hear the village has been all astir.
With all of those people investigating the
ruins, the atmosphere is less...{{delay15}}romantic
than I had hoped.

label: BackRange_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} is to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} up this
road. If you're interested, by all means,
go and look around.
Everyone seems busy investigating the
{{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}} right now though, so
I think I'll save my visit for another day.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh my. You're quite the assertive voe,
coming and talking to me all of a sudden.

Did you know that when a Gerudo comes
of age, she goes on a journey to search
for the voe of her destiny?
I am on the middle of such a voe hunt.
And I believe you and I meeting here may
be fated.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Don't you think so?

Definitely.

No way!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Ahaha! Oh dear... {{delay15}}Apologies, but I was
only joking.

I don't think the voe of my destiny will
make himself so easy to find.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}But thank you for the entertainment.{{delay8}}
That put a smile on my face.

Sav'orq!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh, you said that so bluntly... I can't help
but feel a little hurt.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But no matter. I was only teasing.


I don't think the voe of my destiny will
make himself so easy to find.

---
label: FriendGreet_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh! You're coming up to me again.


If you want to talk that badly, then
perhaps...{{delay15}} Perhaps you believe we're
fated to meet here after all?

---
label: FriendGreet_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Huh? Wait...{{delay8}} Really?


I'm sorry. I don't believe that you are
the voe of my destiny.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Listen... {{delay8}}You have nice eyes.{{delay8}} Why don't
you use them to find the partner you're
meant to be with?

---
label: FriendGreet_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Heh!{{delay8}} It's amusing, isn't it? Our little
back-and-forth.

Though jokes aside, it does make
me wonder when I'll meet the voe of
my destiny...
