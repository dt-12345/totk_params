{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Aaah!{{pageBreak}}Well, if it isn't the prince who saved me
from the Yiga Clan! What a miracle that
we'd meet again! 

---
label: FriendGreet_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! To think we'd meet again, my prince...
And here, no less! Perhaps it's fate?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You know, it's strange... I've heard that
there's heat-resistant clothing for MEN
in Gerudo Town.
But men are famously forbidden in
Gerudo Town, so what's the story there?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Given the target clientele, I'd bet that it's
being sold in some secret shop, hidden
away from all the others.
But where could that shop be? Ugh, so
many questions, so few answers.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}In the Gerudo region, heat-resistant
clothes are tremendously valuable...and
clothes for men are incredibly rare.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}"But wait," you ask, "if men are forbidden
from Gerudo Town, {{delay8}}do clothes like that
even exist?"
Well, I heard that there's a hidden shop
in Gerudo Town that specializes in that
very thing!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}How could any lover of fashion not be
curious about style so secretive?

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}There's a rumor that the bandit Misko
hid some of their {{color id="0"}}treasure {{color id="-1"}}in the {{color id="0"}}desert
southeast{{color id="-1"}} of here.
And get this—that "treasure" is supposed
to be part of Misko's {{color id="0"}}legendary wardrobe{{color id="-1"}}!
Pretty cool right?!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Only problem is all the sinkholes around
there. I'm not sure cool clothes are worth
getting buried alive in a sandy pit...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}The {{color id="0"}}southeastern part of the desert{{color id="-1"}} is
absolutely lousy with sinkholes... I get
scared just thinking of falling in.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Why would {{color id="0"}}Misko {{color id="-1"}}hide their {{color id="0"}}clothes{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere so dangerous?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Those pieces must be so rare, Misko
didn't want anyone to have them!

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So you won't hear this from anybody in
Gerudo Town, but...

there's apparently a secret shop
somewhere in the town that sells
heat-resistant clothing.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Not too surprising, right? Well, get a load
of this. That clothing...is for MEN!

Pretty mysterious, huh? Especially since
men aren't allowed in Gerudo Town.
Makes me want to investigate!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm so curious about Gerudo Town's
secret shop. I mean, a clothing shop for
men in a town that doesn't admit them?
They supposedly sell heat-resistant
clothes, but who's actually buying them?

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Do you know about {{color id="0"}}sinkholes{{color id="-1"}}, my prince?
They're, uh, holes with sand flowing into
them...that can you sink into.
Perhaps that description wasn't terribly
helpful, but there are lots in the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}part of the desert{{color id="-1"}}, so be careful!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Legend has it that the bandit Misko hid
their treasured {{color id="0"}}clothing{{color id="-1"}} around there...

But what kind of clothing is so precious
that you need to hide it in a sea of
sandy deathtraps?

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I want to know what kind of {{color id="0"}}clothing
Misko hid{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} so I'm tempted to make my
way to the {{color id="0"}}southeast part of the desert{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}
But the idea of falling into one of those
sinkholes is nightmarish enough that
I think I'll keep my distance.

label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The daytime heat in the Gerudo Desert
and Gerudo Canyon sure is brutal, huh?

Apparently, someone's selling heat-
resistant men's clothing somewhere
in Gerudo Town.
But if guys aren't allowed into Gerudo
Town, how are they supposed to buy it?
And where would they even sell it?

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}Heat-resistant clothing would really come
in handy in the Gerudo Desert...

If you want some that's tailored for a man,
you'll have to find a secret shop in a town
that explicitly forbids men.
You really have to wonder what kind of
shop can operate like that. Makes me
even more curious to find it!

label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Have you heard about the bandit Misko,
my prince?

They say that long ago, Misko hid their
{{color id="0"}}clothing collection{{color id="-1"}} all over this land.

Apparently, one piece of that collection is
in the {{color id="0"}}southeast Gerudo Desert{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}But that region's filled with sinkholes.{{delay15}}
I'd rather not meet a sandy demise, so
I'll pass on looking for that one.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}What was Misko thinking, hiding those
{{color id="0"}}clothes {{color id="-1"}}in a far-off place like the
{{color id="0"}}southeast Gerudo Desert{{color id="-1"}}?
The distance would be one thing, but all
those sinkholes... I'm too scared for my
wellbeing to actually look for those duds.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Are those...{{delay15}} Yes! The tights I made!{{pageBreak}}They suit you so well! {{delay15}}Look, they're just
your size and everything.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Wait.{{delay8}} It's not just the tights—you're in the
full set! Look at you, all coordinated.{{pageBreak}}I'd never have the courage to pull that off.
For a variety of reasons...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But even that outfit couldn't fool me!{{delay8}} 
I knew it was you right away.

How strange.
