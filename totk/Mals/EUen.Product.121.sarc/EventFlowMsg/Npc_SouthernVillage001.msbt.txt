I'm worried...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You're a traveler, right? Do you happen
to know anything about {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Have... {{delay8}}Have you heard anything about
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0009
---
Lurelin Village?

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If you haven't even heard of it, I can't
expect you to know its fate.

Lurelin Village is on Hyrule's southeastern
coast. It's a small fishing town.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I used to run an inn there, until a gang of
{{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}} descended upon us.

I fled all this way with nothing but the
clothes on my back.

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And what do I find out here? A terrible
{{color id="0"}}sand shroud {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}mysterious monsters{{color id="-1"}}
lurking about.
I don't know what to do with myself now.

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This place is safe enough. The sand
shroud has settled down, and the
soldiers can chase off the monsters...
But who's going to chase away the
{{color id="0"}}pirates {{color id="-1"}}that attacked my village?

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It feels safe here, at least, with all the
soldiers around to protect us.

I just can't help but wish my village had
been so well defended.

Then maybe the monsters wouldn't have
taken it over...

---
label: 0010
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Fair enough. It's a small village, and it's a
long ways southeast of here.

I can't expect you to know about such a
remote place.

---
label: Near_0003
---
How I miss the sea...

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}When I see the sunset leaving its
colors on the water, I think of my
hometown, {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's a small fishing town on the
southeastern coast of Hyrule.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I used to run an inn there, until a gang of
pirates descended upon us.

I had to flee with nothing but the clothes
on my back.

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Fair enough. I can't expect you to know
anything about my little fishing town on
the southeastern coast.
*sigh* While I'm glad I found refuge in
the desert, away from those pirates, I do
miss the ocean...

Welcome!

You can stay for free.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, it's you, the traveler! Good to see
you again!{{pageBreak}}...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}It's...{{delay8}} It's me, remember? We met at
{{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Hmph. You're a horrible voe if you can
forget a fabulous woman like me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But your saving grace is that you've done
so much good around here.{{pageBreak}}You beat those awful pirates, and you
rebuilt my inn, without which I'd have no
way to make a living.
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}And indeed, the whole village benefits
from the customers I draw here.

Sarqso, from the bottom of my heart!


Now then, my special {{color id="0"}}salt spa{{color id="-1"}} will soothe
your body and soul.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome, sir!{{pageBreak}}I have to thank you for what you did.
Without my inn, I'd have no way to
make a living.
And indeed, the whole village benefits
from the customers I draw here.{{pageBreak}}Sarqso, from the bottom of my heart!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry...{{delay15}} I spent some time as a refugee in
the Gerudo region, so I picked up some of
the local language. 
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso! Thank you for coming!{{pageBreak}}Now then, my special {{color id="0"}}salt spa{{color id="-1"}} will soothe
your body and soul.

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome!{{delay15}} Please make yourself at home.

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A bed at the inn will cost {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
But for a weary traveler like you, I suggest
our salt spa! It uses soothing {{color id="0"}}rock salt{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can use a bed here for free.{{delay8}} Or would
you like to experience our calming salt
spa, which uses {{color id="0"}}rock salt{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0000
---
Never mind.

---
label: 0001
---
A bed.

---
label: 0002
---
I'll do the salt spa.

---
label: 0003
---
Salt spa?

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I ask my customers to bring their own
rock salt for the spa.

I'll need {{color id="0"}}five pieces {{color id="-1"}}of {{color id="0"}}rock salt{{color id="-1"}}. Is that
all right?

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You don't know what a salt spa is?
You're missing out!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In short, I give you a massage using rock
salt mixed with Lurelin seawater. It'll relax
you like nothing else!
I ask you to bring your own {{color id="0"}}rock salt{{color id="-1"}},
but it's worth it. You'll be amazed how
soft it makes your skin feel!

---
label: Talk_0006

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So what will it be?

---
label: Talk_0007

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}For how long?

---

Until morning.

Until noon.

Until night.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sav'aaq!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}...Oh, there I go again. I can't seem to
shake off the Gerudo language.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I meant to say, "Rise and shine!"{{delay15}}
No matter what time it is, that's the best
thing to hear when you wake up.

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Rise and sav'aaq!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}...Did I just mix Hylian and Gerudo?
Sorry. Seems I truly can't shake off the
Gerudo language.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But maybe that's not a bad thing!

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Rise and shine!


I meant to rouse you, but...{{delay8}}you woke up
right on schedule!

That's a good sign—{{delay8}}it means your body
got all the rest it needed. Come back to
the salt spa soon!
