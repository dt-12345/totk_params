{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I was planning a visit to {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}},
but I hear it's overrun with pirates.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Guess I'll just sit here patiently reading
the paper and pondering life's mysteries
until the pirates decide to leave.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}To think that I can sit here in a place
like this and read all about the affairs
of our world...
The {{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}}! What a

should consider becoming a journalist.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've got a nose for news, and I heard

I'm tempted to go there... But right now,
I'm way more interested in the rest of
this newspaper.
