{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Beyond the sludge, {{delay8}}my real problem is
the weapons that decayed because of
the Upheaval.
Worse still, the distinguished trade of
blacksmithing has utterly changed in
this day and age.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Have a blade that is ready to shatter?
Just take a monster horn or fang, stick it
on, and that is that. The job is done.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}If my father's generation saw the state of
things today, they would certainly flood
the domain with their tears.

It is a travesty to equate such foolishness

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Link. {{delay15}}Have you already spoken with
{{color id="0"}}Lady Yona{{color id="-1"}}?

She is attempting to repair your
{{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}.

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You know full well that the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}
allows even a Hylian like you to climb
waterfalls.
It is essential if you hope to travel these
parts with ease.

label: talk2009_1

{{color id="0"}}Lady Yona {{color id="-1"}}is at the {{color id="0"}}infirmary{{color id="-1"}}. I suggest
you confer with her there at once.

So, it is you...

---
label: talk2032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}So, it is you... {{delay8}}Do you need something?

---
label: talk2033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I see.{{delay8}} You seek an {{color id="0"}}ancient arowana{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
In that case...

---
label: talk2031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I have heard whispers that what you seek
has been spotted near {{color id="0"}}Mipha's statue{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
which is at the peak of Ploymus Mountain.
This rare fish that has almost never been
caught and was used in the distant past
to repair the Zora armor...
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Why has it appeared again?{{delay15}} Is this, too,
a result of the Upheaval?

The Lightscale Trident...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Your Zora armor has been repaired!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Now you can climb waterfalls as well as
a Zora.{{delay15}} How impressive that she was able
to fix it for you.

---
label: talk2029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Good...{{delay8}} Your Zora armor has at last been
returned to its original condition.

Now you can climb waterfalls as well as a
Zora.{{delay15}} Do not neglect to make good use of
this priceless treasure.

Link...

---
label: talk2013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You should leave.{{delay8}} And take the
Zora armor with you.

The number of wounds it's taken in your
stead... {{delay15}}Such is the honor of armor.

---
label: talk2030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well, you had best be off.{{delay8}} I have no doubt
that your Zora armor will be of great use
to you.

label: near2003

So, here you are...

---
label: talk2012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I suppose, aside from King Sidon,
the only warrior suited for a Champion's
weapon...{{delay8}}is you.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Even if the Lightscale Trident is lost,{{delay15}} bring
the necessary materials, and I, Dento,
will craft you another.

---
label: talk2014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So, Link... You have returned.


Since you are here at my forge, it can only
mean one thing. You desire to possess
the Lightscale Trident. Correct?

---
label: talk2014_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}With a Zora spear, {{delay8}}three diamonds,{{delay8}}
and five pieces of flint, I can craft
the {{color id="0"}}Lightscale Trident{{color id="-1"}} for you.

---
label: talk2015

{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}If you have business with the head

The Lightscale Trident!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ah, so you have gathered everything
we need!

All right. Wait right there.

---
label: talk2018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Wait...{{delay8}} You already have the
Lightscale Trident, {{delay8}}correct?

That weapon is not some trinket to be
duplicated without purpose.{{delay15}} There is no
need for me to craft another at present.

---
label: talk2018_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}That spear shining like the sun upon your
back... That is the Lightscale Trident,
correct?
That weapon is not some trinket to be
duplicated without purpose.{{delay15}} There is no
need for me to craft another at present.

label: talk2020

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The Lightscale Trident...{{delay8}} Make good use
of it, warrior.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If ever it breaks, is lost, or disappears
from this world, come to me at once.{{delay8}}
I will make you another.

---
label: 2004

We will meet again.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}May your life be long and blessed

---
label: talk2022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hm... I cannot feel the presence of the
Lightscale Trident anywhere in this world.

If that is what you seek... I suppose
I could craft one.

Craft away!

---
label: talk2024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}No...{{delay15}} I can still feel the presence of 
the Lightscale Trident somewhere in
this world.
You do not have it with you...{{delay15}}but it must
be somewhere out there.

It would be most unfortunate if it fell into
the hands of monsters.{{delay15}} You must go in
search of it.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}You. {{delay15}}Get down from there this instant!
