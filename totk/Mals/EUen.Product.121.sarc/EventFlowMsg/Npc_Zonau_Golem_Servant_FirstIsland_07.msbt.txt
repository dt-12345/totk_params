{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Do you plan to use the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}You are welcome to do so. {{delay8}}I have largely
achieved my objectives.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Though there is a problem. {{delay8}}You seem to
lack an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}device dispenser {{color id="-1"}}will be no use to
you without one.{{pageBreak}}Find an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} as soon as you can. {{delay8}}
I will then explain this mechanism to you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have an associate by the shores of the
pond at the foot of the mountain. {{delay8}}I believe
it should have a spare {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

I suggest visiting it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It is pointless to use a {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}
without an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Find an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} as soon as you can. {{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I am taking my evening rest.{{pageBreak}}You are free to use the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The mechanism before you is a
{{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="-1"}}It uses resources such as {{color id="0"}}construct
horns {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}Zonai charges {{color id="-1"}}to produce
{{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_38

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It is easy to use. {{delay8}}Simply hold the required
resources and drop them into the
receptacle. {{delay8}}The dispenser does the rest.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}} are a form of portable
Zonai devices. They are immensely
convenient.{{pageBreak}}I recommend that you actively convert
surplus resources into them. {{delay8}}Then you
will always have some with you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}A device cannot be returned to its

to be disposable.{{pageBreak}}Note that there is no need to hoard them.

{{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}} at once.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes. This is a {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
It produces Zonai capsules by
