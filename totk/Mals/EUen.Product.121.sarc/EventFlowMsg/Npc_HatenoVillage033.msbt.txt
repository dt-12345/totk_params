Is it seriously raining?

Don't be too reckless, OK?

Phew. I better get inside.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's too early to be as awake as you. I'm
still so tired...

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The sun shows no mercy from its sky
throne. I hope evening comes soon.

label: Talk_27

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Too bad about this weather, huh? Dark
skies always put me in a bleak mood.

label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The sun's gone down, I see.{{pageBreak}}But the Cece stuff around the village still
makes everything seem so bright.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Just my luck that it's raining. I hope my
li'l Cuccos aren't wet and sad.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Eek, he's talking to me...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}So, uh. Is there anything special bringing
you to {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village {{color id="-1"}}at this hour?{{pageBreak}}All we have are {{color id="0"}}veggies{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}'s fashion,
and...{{delay15}}just those two things, really.{{pageBreak}}So, y'know. {{delay15}}Not much point attacking
our homes or anything.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}Who is this freak?!{{color id="-1"}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}Uh, hey there. What brings you to town?

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look, it doesn't matter how handsome
you are, or how many times you swing by
to chat. I'm not giving you any more eggs.{{pageBreak}}Just forget me...

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, did you make some room? OK then,
a promise is a promise. One egg, just
for you.

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Still...no matter how good-looking you
might be, I can't let you have any more
of my prized eggs.{{pageBreak}}Do us both a favor and...forget me...

---
label: Talk_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm. You haven't made room like I asked,
huh? That's fine. I'll keep sitting on this
egg as long as it takes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh, he's actually pretty handsome now that I get
a good look.{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="-1"}}Hey! I have a good idea. You should take
this and not ask any questions.

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Uh-oh. You're carrying around so many
eggs already. Do you really have room for
any of mine?{{pageBreak}}My prized eggs need their space. {{delay8}}I'll give
you one if you come back later, OK?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, there I go making promises again.{{delay8}}
Try and forget what happened between
us today...

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}You swept me off my feet so fast that I
gave you one of my prized eggs!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}No more though... Just forget what
happened here today.

How could I ever forget?

---
label: Talk_32

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Your heart is like a Cucco's egg—easily
given but easy to break.

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Please, find it in your heart to forget what
happened today.

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Your heart is like a Cucco's egg—the taste
is heavenly, but it's all eaten up before
you know it.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hm. This isn't working.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}I was wondering whether it was possible
to romanticize eggs.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But in the end, eggs are something you
cook and eat for breakfast, and that's it.

label: 0003

OK! It's forgotten.

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I feel like you weren't getting what I was
going for there. Way to kill the mood.

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I was wondering if there was some way I
could romanticize eggs.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But in the end, eggs are something you
cook and eat for breakfast, and that's it.{{pageBreak}}They say a Cucco's memory lasts for three
steps. If you promise to forget this whole
thing, I'll forget it too.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I should head back to work.{{pageBreak}}The stores and barn are always open.
Take it easy, stranger.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh, hi again.{{pageBreak}}I was afraid you were up to no good,
coming to the village at this hour.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm cleaning up to take my mind off
things until morning comes.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}At first light, it'll be my son {{color id="0"}}Teebo{{color id="-1"}}'s turn
to take over on watch duty.{{pageBreak}}He does the job more like my husband
used to do.{{pageBreak}}Checking for suspicious people, {{color id="0"}}guiding
visitors around the village{{color id="-1"}}, that sort
of thing.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And who might you be?{{pageBreak}}Just kidding. They say a Cucco's memory
only lasts for three steps, but my memory
is better than that.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Three days, though, and there might be a problem...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="-1"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Besides, nights have been unexpectedly
busy for me ever since I took over for my
husband while he's at Lookout Landing.{{pageBreak}}The only Cuccos I have time for here are
the eggs.{{pageBreak}}If you need something in the village,
you'll probably find it along the main
thoroughfare.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We did have more Cuccos here once,
but we couldn't make time to take care
of them.{{pageBreak}}Most of the ones we have left are kept
at {{color id="0"}}the barn at the top of the hill{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, but if you'd like to take any of the
eggs here with you, I don't mind at all.{{pageBreak}}The Cuccos produce so many eggs that
there's plenty for everyone.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My son and I guard the gate in shifts, so
I'm on my way to the {{color id="0"}}village entrance{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}He's been watching my husband work as
the gatekeeper for a long time, so he's
pretty good at it when it's his turn.{{pageBreak}}I feel bad when it comes time for a
scaredy-cat like me to {{color id="0"}}guard the gate{{color id="-1"}}.
But I can't let a little kid do all the work.

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, uh, did you still need something?
I need to hurry and relieve my son from
his shift.{{pageBreak}}He's been watching my husband work as
the gatekeeper for a long time, so he's
pretty good at it when it's his turn.{{pageBreak}}I feel bad when it comes time for a

But I can't let a little kid do all the work.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm headed back home. Someone needs
to look after the Cuccos.{{pageBreak}}My son, Teebo, does a great job as the
village {{color id="0"}}gatekeeper{{color id="-1"}}, so it's not like I need
to be there anyway.{{pageBreak}}I guess he thinks he needs to live up to
his father's example, since my husband
went to work at Lookout Landing.{{pageBreak}}He takes it all very seriously. He even
shows people around town, just like he
says a real {{color id="0"}}gatekeeper {{color id="-1"}}should.

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, uh, did you still need something?{{pageBreak}}My son, Teebo, is doing a great job filling
in as village gatekeeper while my husband
is off at Lookout Landing.{{pageBreak}}I'm using my break now to look after my
Cuccos at home.{{pageBreak}}But I'm sure my son would be happy to
{{color id="0"}}show you around town {{color id="-1"}}if you ask him.

You need to get under a roof somewhere.
