someone comes from {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} to

I've been told that, for a Gerudo,
spending time in Gerudo Town is
an honor.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And Mattison does seem to be looking

I...I didn't realize this would be so hard
for me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, sorry you had to listen to me go on

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Oh, Mattison. She's had to grow up

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Then again, maybe she won't have to.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, it's you. {{delay15}}So, you know, I've been
doing a lot of thinking...

Trying to figure out what I could possibly
do for Mattison.

---
label: Talk_0116
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And, well, {{delay15}}what I came up with is this.

---
label: Talk_0110
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Gerudo Town is pretty far from here,
and there are plenty of monsters along
the way.
So, I thought I'd make Mattison her own
special air balloon!

---
label: Talk_0128
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But...I want to make it really special.
Something just for her. I'm just...not
sure how to do that.

---
label: Talk_0114
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Special or not, I love the balloon you
made, Papa. It looks like the sun!

---
label: Talk_0088
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The sun...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That's it! Let's color it yellow like
the sun.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've seen {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}} around here. I could
use them to make a dye. Bet I'd get a
beautiful shade of yellow from them.
But for me to dye something this size,
I'd need {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="IchikaraChallenge01_HidamariNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}of them.

---
label: Talk_0089
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You need {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}, Papa? Those are
the bright yellow flowers, right?

I'll make finding them my new miss-son!

---
label: Talk_0090
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I appreciate the thought, but it's much too
difficult. Sundelions are quite rare.

I'm not even sure where you'd find them.

---
label: Talk_0091
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Don't worry! I've seen a sundelion before.
It was attached to the ruins that fell from
the sky.

---
label: Talk_0106
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The sky, huh?

---
label: Near_0015
---
Sundelions...sundelions...

---
label: Talk_1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}I'm sooo tired. I'm not giving up
my miss-son. I'll look for {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}
again tomorrow...

---
label: Talk_1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}I'll turn into a bird...fly through the air...
find the {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}... *mumbling*

---
label: Near_0012
---
Gotta find sundelions...

---
label: Talk_0165
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmmm...bright yellow {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}...


You know, if it was attached to those
ruins that fell from up above, then maybe
there's a flower field in the {{color id="0"}}sky{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0173
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder if any of them are growing
somewhere...

---
label: Talk_0153
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I need to finish this up quick. It'd be awful
if Mattison got sick from being out in all
this rain.

---
label: Talk_0154
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}Hm...I smell...the sun.

---
label: Talk_0152
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If only I had {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="IchikaraChallenge01_HidamariNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} sundelions{{color id="-1"}}, then I'd be
able to dye the balloon a bright yellow.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But...I don't know where I'm going to
get them from.

---
label: 0008
---
Here's {{number14 ref="IchikaraChallenge01_HidamariNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} sundelions.

---
label: 0009
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_0177
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's like Mattison said...the {{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}}
she saw was attached to fallen ruins.

So it could be they don't grow down here
on the ground.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Huh?!{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's awesome! {{delay8}}You did it! You really
and truly collected {{number14 ref="IchikaraChallenge01_HidamariNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them!

---
label: Talk_0183
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}What's this? You found them all for us?
Looks like I'll have no problem dyeing the
balloon the color of the sun.

---
label: Talk_0184
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Awww, I wasn't any help at all. I failed
my miss-son.

---
label: Talk_0185
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That's not true, Mattison.{{pageBreak}}Your papa is about to turn this balloon
into the sun, isn't he?

I know, why don't you help me with that?

---
label: Talk_0187

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I will! I will, Papa! I'll help you make
the sun!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}At last. It's done. And morning is
already here.

---
label: Talk_0206

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}OK. It's done. {{delay8}}It's already morning, eh?
Guess that took a whole day.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I see. {{delay15}}All right.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let's all go together, then. In Mattison's
special sun balloon!
