We have to get it back!

label: Near_00_01
---
What'll we do...

---
label: Talk_00_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, it's you! Here you are again!

---
label: Talk_00_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oooh, Nat! This must be fate.

---
label: Talk_00_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}S-stop it!


We've got a real problem on our hands,
given what's happened to our tent.

It's not the time to talk about {{color id="0"}}that{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_00_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}You're right.{{delay15}} Still, just when we found
a cave that surely had a trove of
mushrooms and more...

---
label: Talk_00_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}All right, all right. {{delay8}}So, we found a cave
at the bottom of a mountain, along this
road for a bit.
We pitched our tent there, and then
hurried back here to the stable.

---
label: Talk_00_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Right. And by the time we got back to
our tent, we found monsters inside.
That's our tent though!

---
label: Talk_00_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}And that's why, despite our bumping
into each other again here, this is totally
not the time to talk about {{color id="0"}}that{{color id="-1"}}.
We have to chase off those
{{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}somehow.

---
label: Near_01_00
---
No going back to our tent.

---
label: Near_01_01
---
Your reward...

---
label: Talk_00_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm sorry, we finally bumped into each
other again here. But really, it's no time
to talk about {{color id="0"}}that{{color id="-1"}}.
We have to chase the {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}away
from our tent somehow.

---
label: Talk_00_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}To think that {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} would take over
our tent!

Just when we'd found a cave that had
a trove of mushrooms and who knows
what else?

---
label: Talk_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh? You defeated them?{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}There aren't any more monsters?

---
label: Talk_01_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, amazing! So amazing. And strong.

---
label: Talk_01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}What a relief. Most of what we packed
for our journey is in that tent. Now we
can continue to search for {{color id="0"}}that{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}We owe you. So, here you go.

---
label: Talk_01_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}We're going to bring you into our secret
quest to find {{color id="0"}}that{{color id="-1"}}, as we promised.

---
label: Talk_01_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We're on the hunt for a fabled place—{{delay8}}a
{{color id="0"}}haven of mushrooms{{color id="-1"}}.

We discovered a note in a field guide to
mushrooms that hinted of something
spectacular! It said...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}"Vapors drift over Sturnida Basin, near a
pond in Hebra. At the source of the steam
lies a bright mushroom haven."

---
label: Talk_01_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}At the time, we didn't think much of it.{{delay15}}
Just a strange little note someone left
in the margins.
Then the Upheaval happened and caves
opened up. And we thought maybe, just
maybe...{{delay8}}we could find a haven of our own.

---
label: Talk_01_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Who knows? {{delay8}}Maybe it was a joke some
prankster scribbled in there.{{delay8}} But if there
is a {{color id="0"}}mushroom haven{{color id="-1"}}, we have to find it!

---
label: Talk_01_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This is between us, you understand.
Me, my sister...{{delay15}}and now you.

---
label: Talk_01_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}If the message we saw in that field guide
was accurate, {{delay8}}then the haven must be
here in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We just have to find the {{color id="0"}}pond{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}} and follow
the {{color id="0"}}drifting steam{{color id="-1"}} to its {{color id="0"}}source{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}So, we'd better get going.{{delay15}} Thanks, buddy!{{delay8}}
For getting our tent back!

---
label: Talk_01_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}...{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! Your pouch is full.{{pageBreak}}I was going to give you some of our home
cooking. {{delay8}}Could you organize your things
and get back to me?

---
label: Talk_01_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was going to repay you for retrieving our
tent with a nice, home-cooked meal.

But your pouch is still full. Why don't you
throw something out and get back to me?

---
label: Talk_01_11

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hey,{{delay8}} you made room!{{delay15}} Here you go, then!
