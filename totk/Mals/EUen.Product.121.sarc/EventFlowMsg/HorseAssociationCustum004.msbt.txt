{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hello there. {{delay8}}Going by your clothes,{{delay15}}
I take it you're not a member of the
survey team.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're a traveler, aren't you?


Have you, by chance, seen anything like
a {{color id="0"}}new animal species {{color id="-1"}}on your travels?
Please tell me you have!

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, traveler! If you're striking up
conversation with me again...

Does that mean you've seen something
like a {{color id="0"}}new animal species{{color id="-1"}}? Please, tell me
if you know anything!

---
label: 0007
---
New animal species?

---
label: Talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh. Guess not, then.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's a big rumor spreading around the
Stable Association, of something I think
might be a {{color id="0"}}new animal species{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It sounds big and brutal like a bear—and
kind of tusky like a rhino. But rumor is
that it's not a bear OR a rhino.
I think it's a lot more than just a rumor
though. There's an actual {{color id="0"}}picture of the
animal's footprints{{color id="-1"}} at one stable!
If you see anything like a {{color id="0"}}new animal
species{{color id="-1"}} in your travels, please, please,
please let me know!

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh. Guess not, then.{{pageBreak}}I'm sure you'd remember if you saw a
giant bear-rhino-looking thing that isn't
a bear OR a rhino.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Might sound like a half-baked rumor...{{delay15}}
But it's real! I know it is!

There's one stable that even has a {{color id="0"}}picture
of its footprints{{color id="-1"}}!

If you see anything like a {{color id="0"}}new animal
species{{color id="-1"}}, please, please, please let me
know right away!

About Dondons...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}No kidding... "Dondons," huh?
Princess Zelda was studying them
at Lakeside Stable?
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}That's...{{delay15}} That's...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Amazing! The rumor that everyone was
talking about turned out to be real!
A {{color id="0"}}new species of animal{{color id="-1"}}!
I know what I'm gonna do during my next
break—take a trip to Lakeside Stable to
visit those Dondons.
Thanks, buddy!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Here's a little something for you.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Truth be told, I wasn't at all sure that
there was anything to the rumor, but it
was exciting to think about.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But what do you know, Dondons really
do exist! And I have to say, these animals
sound pretty interesting.
I think I'll go to Lakeside Stable during
my next break. I want to see some of
these creatures for myself!

I was going to thank you with a fresh
{{color id="0"}}endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}How about you free up some space and
we try this again?

label: Talk_2001

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm? Your pouch is still full.


That's OK. Just come talk to me when
