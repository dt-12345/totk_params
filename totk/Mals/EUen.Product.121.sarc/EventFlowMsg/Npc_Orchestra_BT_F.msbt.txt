{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}It's the swordsman! How've you been?{{pageBreak}}I'll remember the dancing fireflies we
saw that time for the rest of my life.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Which reminds me. {{delay8}}After we played the
stable the other day, a traveler came up
and personally thanked us!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}"Your beautiful performances are always
a treat," they said. {{delay15}}That's the kind of
feedback I live for.{{pageBreak}}We're using this stable as our home base
right now, but someday I'd like to travel
the world and bring our act to everyone.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}You could come too! You're practically
a member of our troupe, after all.

Well enough that you don't feel like you
need clothes anymore, I guess.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, you've done your share of traveling.
Have you ever seen a dragon before?{{pageBreak}}Sometimes, high in the sky, I see what
looks like a long cloud—or maybe a
shadow—moving around.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm convinced they might be the dragons
from the legends!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But everyone laughs at the idea, saying,
"Come on, you know dragons aren't real."{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Why am I the only one who can see them?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you believe in dragons?{{pageBreak}}According to legend, there are {{color id="0"}}three
dragons{{color id="-1"}} in the world, called Dinraal,
Farosh, and Naydra.{{pageBreak}}Sometimes, high in the sky, I see what
look like red, yellow, or even blue clouds
moving around.{{pageBreak}}I really think those might be them.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Although every once in a while, I spot
a glowing white one too.{{pageBreak}}Were the legends wrong? Are there
actually four dragons?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What do you think the Great Fairies'
clothes are made from?{{pageBreak}}The conductor's opinion is that they're
made out of {{color id="0"}}dragon's scales{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But the storybooks say that {{color id="0"}}dragon scales{{color id="-1"}}
are only awarded to those courageous
enough to hit a dragon with an arrow.{{pageBreak}}If that's true, then the Great Fairies must
be super strong!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Look up in the sky!{{pageBreak}}Is it me, or is something moving up there?
I bet it's a dragon!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But everyone else laughs at the idea,
saying, "Come on, dragons aren't real."{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Why am I the only one who can see them?
