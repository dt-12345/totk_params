{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_00"}}My house...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This is my home. Or rather...it used to be.


It was partially destroyed by the falling
ruins. I said I didn't care what they did
with it after that and set off on a journey.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Big mistake. I thought they would just
remove the rubble. I didn't think they'd
go and build a research facility here...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry you had to see me like that.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I was just a little shocked to see my
home...er, transformed like that.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But if my home is useful as a place of
research for my village, I'm thrilled!
I, Cado, am happy to donate my house!

label: Talk_15

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, it's just that my house was turned
into a research facility while I was away
on my journey.
But if my home is useful to the village like
this, I'm thrilled! I welcome the change!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah, if it isn't Sir Link! What's on
your mind?

As for me, I just came by to check on my
precious Cuccos!

I never imagined that my house would be
turned into a research facility while I was
traveling. Life is full of surprises!
It's a tough reality to accept... {{delay15}}Luckily,
I've managed to accept it easily, so don't
you worry about Cado!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}If it isn't Sir Link! Out for a stroll, are we?


Who, me? I'm...um...well... Ah, yes!
The Cuccos!

I was just doing the rounds, making sure
my precious Cuccos are doing well!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I trained them to protect the village from
the Yiga Clan while I was away...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I fear I may have been too strict with
their training.

Ever since I've returned, none of them
will come and see me...

again? Please?{{delay15}}

No, that's not right...{{delay15}} You're the only one for me,
my love. I was an idiot, like always... {{delay15}}Ooo,
I think she'll like that better.
*sigh* I had no idea it would be this hard to
face her...{{size value="100"}}
