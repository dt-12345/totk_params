{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Karson, when do you think the {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}
will be ready?

label: Talk_00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}It'll still be a while yet.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I need to get the last of the {{color id="0"}}roof planks{{color id="-1"}}
correctly fitted.

label: Talk_00_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's only {{color id="0"}}one spot{{color id="-1"}} to finish.

---
label: Talk_00_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Well, until the {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}} is ready, we can't
board any more horses. What a shame.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I heard that {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} has been
sighted.

That news is making it challenging to
focus on the task at hand...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, Link. What is it?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hang on... {{delay8}}The roof {{delay8}}is done?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Well look at that—{{delay8}}it fits perfectly!

---
label: Talk_01_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thanks for helping out! {{delay8}}I was having a
hard time figuring out how to fit it.

With the roof done, all that's left is to add
the finishing touches! I'll get cracking.
{{delay8}}Son and done!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I heard that {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} was
seen recently.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But first things first. I need to finish up
my work!

---
label: Talk_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I want to finish up construction on the
{{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}, but I'm not sure how best to
tackle fitting this {{color id="0"}}roof plank {{color id="-1"}}in...

---
label: Talk_01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Travelers come by here often, so there's
a lot of {{color id="0"}}requests for horses{{color id="-1"}}.

I do wish I could build the {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}} in our
classic son-and-done fashion...

---
label: Talk_01_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}With things as they are now, I really feel
for the horses... {{delay15}}Hm?

---
label: Talk_01_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Are you interested in horses?
Unfortunately our {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}} here is
under construction.
If you want to register or take any horses
out, you'll need to use one of the other
nearby {{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_01_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah yes, this is where we care for
the horses.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Normally we can {{color id="0"}}board{{color id="-1"}} travelers' precious
{{color id="0"}}horses {{color id="-1"}}here, but with an incomplete
{{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}, there's only so much we can do.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So if you're in a hurry, please use one of
the other nearby {{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}} for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Around here, the closest one is
{{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}} to the west.

label: Talk_01_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Apologies, but this {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}} is currently
under construction.

please use one of the other
nearby {{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}And thanks for your help with this little
project, son. {{delay8}}Looks great.

Now we can board horses at Lookout
Landing. If you need help with {{color id="0"}}horses{{color id="-1"}},
please talk to me anytime.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I heard that {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} was sighted
at Hyrule Castle, which has me all kinds
of curious.
But it's my job to care for the horses
properly so those who go out searching
have healthy transport.
I'll leave the business regarding Princess
Zelda to everyone else.
