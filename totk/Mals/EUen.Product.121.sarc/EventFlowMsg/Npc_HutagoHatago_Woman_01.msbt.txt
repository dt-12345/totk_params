{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}"Leave the arms"? {{delay8}}What are you
talking about?

I wasn't singing anything remotely like
that! I've never sung a song with
those lyrics...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}♪Seek the storm, seek the storm...♪{{delay8}}
Is that maybe what you heard?

Because that's what I was singing!


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You also heard "for if not, I'll do
you harm"?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Leave your arms or I'll kill you? {{delay8}}Hahaha!{{delay8}}
What kind of nonsensical song is that?

♪Fear it not, you will stay warm.♪


Those are the lyrics I was singing! And if
you put it all together...

{{anim type="Humming_00"}}♪Seek the storm, seek the storm...
Fear it not, you will stay warm.♪

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's a song about a cute little fox who is
proud of their warm fur coat, and they
chase storms since they don't get cold!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Anyway, I'm not trying to cause trouble
or anything... {{delay15}}But I don't think it's entirely
my fault if people misheard things either.
I just like how my voice sounds here.{{delay8}}
Prettier. More refined.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Hmph. It sounded fine to me, but
everyone else is hearing dire threats.

"Leave the arms..." I guess that explains
why weapons kept getting thrown in the
well every morning.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}They could be dangerous, so I collected
them all over there.

I've got no interest in them, so feel free
to help yourself!

label: ChallengeTalk_100

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm going to keep practicing my singing in
this well! The acoustics are really nice.

Maybe I could live here? Then I'd never
have to walk to practice my singing!

Oh, but all these weapons are in the way.
I don't need them, so take as many as
you want!
