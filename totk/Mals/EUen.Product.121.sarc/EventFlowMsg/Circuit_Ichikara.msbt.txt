I want to talk to you...

---
label: 0011
---
Bye.

---
label: 0012
---
There's a water rally...

---
label: Talk_0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I got a good look at your driving skills
with these eyes of mine, voe!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Mark my words, when the preparations for
the Tarrey Town Race are complete, you'll
be back.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Why, you ask?{{delay15}} Bah!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You have the heart of a racer, that's why!
You can't resist the pull of the driver's
seat for long.

---
label: Talk_0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I better see you back here when the
Tarrey Town Race gets up and running.

---
label: Talk_0048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}There's more to it than I thought.


It's not just about the driving technique.
It is about how the driver makes use of 
the vehicle's unique capabilities.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}As I watched you run the course from the
sidelines, your approach enlightened me.
You have my thanks. Sarqso.

---
label: Talk_0088
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Watching you drive was...enlightening.
I realized many important things. Sarqso.

---
label: Near_0002
---
Time to get things ready!

---
label: Talk_0063
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I am so grateful you found the
steering stick.

Now I can get to work on the project I'm
most excited about—the {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town
Race{{color id="-1"}}. Thank you, really!

---
label: Talk_0070
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}The Tarrey Town Race project is an
important part of the effort to develop
new vehicles.
And it's almost ready. I just need to wrap
up some final details.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I will need a bit of time to prepare, but it
shouldn't take long.

While you wait, why not get a bit of rest
at a stable?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You can put that free sleepover ticket
to good use.

---
label: Near_0001
---
Tarrey Town Race is a go!

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}You're the traveler from before!{{delay8}} I knew
you couldn't stay away.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
Take a look at this!

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}With the help of Hudson Construction, we
built a course for test-driving vehicles.

These runs will help us better research
the steering stick's capabilities.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So, welcome to the Tarrey Town Race!

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}With Tali as our test driver, we spent a lot
of time tinkering with the course design...

And we arrived at this masterpiece!

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Watching you drive the course was
very informative. I'm grateful.

Sarqso.

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Drivers have to use the {{color id="0"}}steering stick
we provide{{color id="-1"}}. It's the only way I can collect
the data I need.
As far as the vehicle itself—anything goes!
Use whatever you like.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Now, if you're up for it, I'd love to see you
do some driving.

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}While you're at it, why not spice things
up with a little competition? Say...you
versus Tali?{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}She used to be called the Dame of the
Dunes, ya know. If you can beat her
best time, well then...you win!

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Yes.{{anim type="LaughS_01"}} Not a bad idea.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Sounds fun, doesn't it?


If I recall correctly, Tali's best time is {{color id="0"}}two
minutes{{color id="-1"}} exactly.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So how about it? Want to see if you can
beat Tali's record?

---
label: 0015
---
Of course!

---
label: 0017
---
Tell me the rules.

---
label: 0000
---
I'm not interested.

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Tali's fastest time is {{color id="0"}}2 minutes{{color id="-1"}} exactly.
So that's the time you need to beat.

Touch {{color id="0"}}all the lights{{color id="-1"}} and then get back
here faster than that, and you win.

But you can't {{color id="0"}}take your hands off{{color id="-1"}}
the steering stick or {{color id="0"}}go too far off
course{{color id="-1"}}, OK?
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}So how about it?{{delay8}} You want to make a run
for Tali's record?

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You bet. I'm happy to go over it as much
as you need.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I guess you can't lose if you don't try,
eh?{{delay8}} I hadn't figured you for the sort to
back down.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Color me disappointed.

---
label: Talk_0077
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}So, my record stands without challenge.
Unfortunate.

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Well, if you change your mind, you're
welcome to try for the record anytime.

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Wooo-hooo!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I apologize. I got excited, and I can't help
but woo and hoo when I get excited.

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Once you've readied the vehicle you plan
to use in the race, go ahead and attach
the {{color id="0"}}steering stick {{color id="-1"}}we prepared.

---
label: Talk_0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Since you'll be helping us collect data,{{delay8}}
any Zonai device or building material you
find around here is yours to use.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just let me know when everything
is ready.

I'm confident it won't take you long
to beat that.

---
label: Talk_0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}With a record like that... Well, I'm sure
you'll beat it right away.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomSavotta_00"}}Sav'otta. You here to do some driving this
morning?

course's lights?

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Having someone like you to compete with
will help keep Tali sharp.

And a piece of advice... Don't go thinking
you'll be able to beat her record so easily.

---
label: Near_0003

Can't wait to see you race!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You're dying for a chance to beat Tali's
record, aren't ya? I can see it all over
your face.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Are you going to challenge Tali's record?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}The steering stick is all set up,{{delay15}} so we're
good to begin.

---
label: Talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Eh...{{delay8}} With the steering stick in that
position, it's going to be difficult to
get a good, solid grip.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You'll have to make it safe to drive or
I won't be able to capture the data
I need.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Let's see... {{delay8}}First I'll activate the switch for

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Let me explain the rules again.{{pageBreak}}Tali's record is {{color id="0"}}2 minutes{{color id="-1"}} exactly. You
must touch{{color id="0"}} all of the lights{{color id="-1"}} and return to

Don't {{color id="0"}}take your hands off{{color id="-1"}} the steering

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}It is a difficult announcement to make.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}So you know, you pay the {{color id="0"}}{{number15 ref="Circuit_Ichikara_PayRupee" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} rupee{{color id="-1"}}
entry fee in advance. If you're going
to give it a go, I can take that now.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you {{color id="0"}}touch all the lights{{color id="-1"}} and get back
here within the time limit, you win.

But {{color id="0"}}take your hands off{{color id="-1"}} the steering stick
once you've grabbed it or {{color id="0"}}go too far off
course{{color id="-1"}}, and I have to disqualify you.
The rules are in the book on the desk if
you care to check it out later.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Now I'm going to explain the rules, just
to make sure they've sunk in.{{pageBreak}}The time limit for the beginner course
is {{color id="0"}}2 minutes{{color id="-1"}} exactly.

You want to touch {{color id="0"}}all the lights{{color id="-1"}} and get
back here within that time, OK?

If you {{color id="0"}}take your hands off{{color id="-1"}} the steering
stick once you've grabbed it or {{color id="0"}}go too
far off course{{color id="-1"}}, you're disqualified.
Understand?{{delay8}} Good. {{delay8}}Now, on your marks...

If you {{color id="0"}}touch each and every light {{color id="-1"}}and get

you win!
But {{color id="0"}}don't let go {{color id="-1"}}of the steering stick once
you've grabbed it, and {{color id="0"}}don't go too far off
