{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}History class is ordinarily a bit slow-paced
for the children's taste.{{pageBreak}}That last lesson may have been the first
time I've seen them enjoying a history
lecture so much.{{pageBreak}}Our next class is a {{color id="0"}}home economics{{color id="-1"}}
lesson. Naturally, you're free to sit in
again if the subject interests you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}My, my, you're early. You're welcome to

They should arrive soon...

It sure is chilly today.

---
label: Near_0005
---
Should I rethink this class?

---
label: Talk_0400
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Today's home economics class may have
been a bit too difficult.{{pageBreak}}But in a world as dangerous as ours, we
must raise our children to understand the
power to be found in ingredients.{{pageBreak}}Only then can they prepare dishes to
help them handle whatever comes
their way.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I think I'll review my syllabus so far once
I've finished cleaning up here.{{pageBreak}}To teach is to learn, after all.

---
label: Near_0006
---
What shall I read today?

---
label: Talk_0500
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}"History is a tale we all tell together. It's
inherited from those who came before us
and passed along to those who follow."{{pageBreak}}So said Princess Zelda when asked why
she founded this school.{{pageBreak}}I want the children to make it in this
perilous world and have a bright future.{{pageBreak}}That's why I put so much effort into
teaching them about history...especially
about {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But teaching is learning, you know, so I
read and reread books every day to make
sure I'm up to the task.

label: 0002
---
The Calamity?

---
label: Talk_0503
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The Calamity has visited this land of
Hyrule several times over.{{pageBreak}}However, 10,000 years ago, {{delay8}}there were
Divine Beasts, built by the Sheikah using
their advanced technology.{{pageBreak}}Each of them was controlled by a skilled
pilot as well.

---
label: Talk_0504
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}With the sword that seals the darkness
and the power of the sacred princess, the
Ancient Hero stopped the Calamity.{{pageBreak}}For a long while after that, the lands of
Hyrule knew peace.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But the time when the people forgot about
the Calamity was the moment it returned
to menace them once more...

---
label: 0004
---
When was that?

---
label: Talk_0509
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}This all happened about 100 years ago.{{delay8}}
It began with an oracle prophesying the 
Calamity's return.{{pageBreak}}The royal family took their cues from the
legends of the past. {{delay8}}They found and
excavated the Divine Beasts.{{pageBreak}}Skilled members of the Rito, Goron, Zora,
and Gerudo peoples were selected to pilot
them. They were called the Champions.

---
label: Talk_0511
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}With the wielder of the sword that seals
the darkness and the sacred princess, all
the pieces from the legend were in place.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But...this time, the Calamity would not be
bested so easily...

---
label: 0006
---
What happened?

---
label: Talk_0510
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sadly, the sacred princess was unable to
awaken the holy power within her.{{pageBreak}}The Divine Beasts were taken over by the
Calamity. Those selected to pilot them
lost their lives in the process.{{pageBreak}}Worse still, the hero wielding the sword
that seals the darkness was badly hurt.
Just when all seemed lost...{{pageBreak}}the sacred princess came into her power
and devoted her whole being to keeping
the Calamity at bay for 100 years.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Are you following along so far?{{pageBreak}}After spending 100 years dormant, the
hero wielding the sword that seals the
darkness awakened, his wounds healed.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}He won back the Divine Beasts with the
help of several allies, including some of
the Champions' descendants.{{pageBreak}}And in the end, the hero defeated the
Calamity, and the sacred princess stopped
the evil one!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry, I got a little emotional there at the
end. {{delay8}}It's a true story though.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But I suppose you're very familiar with
the particulars of that tale. Sorry for
drawing it out.

That's enough for now.

---

I see.

Good night.

---
label: Talk_0505
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Tomorrow's lesson is on home economics.{{pageBreak}}I have a lecture planned about unique
dishes, so if that interests you, you're
welcome to stop by and sit in!

---
label: Talk_0506
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sorry for rambling on so long. I expect
you know this story quite well already.

---
label: Near_0007
---
Maybe it's time for sleep.

---
label: Talk_0508
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Each night before I turn in, I think about 
Hyrule's history with the Calamity.{{pageBreak}}We are only here today because of the
history our predecessors built, so there's
a big responsibility to learn it.

---
label: Near_0008
---
Our next lesson is on food.

---
label: Talk_0600
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Today's lecture is on home economics.
Food is essential for our survival.{{pageBreak}}A keen culinary sense can help you stay
alive in this perilous world.{{pageBreak}}I'd like to put a question to you all:{{pageBreak}}What dish do you get by mixing Goron 
spice with Hylian rice and raw meat?

---
label: Talk_0602
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}{{color id="0"}}Goron spice{{color id="-1"}} is{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}the hot stuff they sell in
Goron City in the northeast, right?

---
label: Talk_0603
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If it's got {{color id="0"}}Goron spice{{color id="-1"}} in it, the answer
can't be anything but curry.

---
label: Talk_0601
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But the only other thing in it is {{color id="0"}}raw meat{{color id="-1"}},
right? So obviously...

---
label: Talk_0604
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The answer has to be "meat curry"!

---
label: Talk_0605
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Yes, that's correct. That one might have
been on the simple side for all of you.
How about this one, then?{{pageBreak}}Take Goron spice, Hylian rice...{{delay8}}and mix
in...{{delay15}}{{color id="0"}}monster extract{{color id="-1"}}. What do you
get then?

---
label: Talk_0607
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Monster what?!

---
label: Talk_0608

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Um, aren't monster parts only used
for medicines?

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}Yeah! If you try to cook with monster
parts, it's a disaster every time!

---
label: Talk_0609
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}No one would eat curry made with
monster stuff! I call trick question!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hey, hey, settle down, children...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Hm, this lesson may be too advanced.{{pageBreak}}In fact, combining monster extract,
Goron spice, and Hylian rice makes
{{color id="0"}}monster curry{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}But judging from your skeptical faces,
you won't believe me unless I can put
a dish of it in front of you.{{size value="80"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'd love to make some {{color id="0"}}curry {{color id="-1"}}for them, but I don't

make {{color id="0"}}monster curry {{color id="-1"}}for the children,
I found myself unable to sleep...

---
label: Talk_0701
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The Goron spice and Hylian rice are easy
enough. It's getting some {{color id="0"}}monster extract{{color id="-1"}}
that may prove difficult.{{pageBreak}}I'm sure I heard there was some to be had
in the north at {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} in Akkala.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Wait... Even half asleep, I'd recognize

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}The teacher's confused again.

label: Talk_0612

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Mr. Symin, you're the one who taught us
that monster parts should only be used
for medicine!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hm, this just isn't working.{{pageBreak}}If only I had {{color id="0"}}monster curry{{color id="-1"}}, I could prove
