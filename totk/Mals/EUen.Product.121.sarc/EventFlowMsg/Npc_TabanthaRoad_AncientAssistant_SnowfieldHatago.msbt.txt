{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The blizzard outside is really terrible.{{delay8}}
I wonder when it will stop.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you come in here to {{color id="0"}}take shelter
from the cold{{color id="-1"}} too?

I was on my way to investigate some
ruins in a snowfield north of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Then this blizzard started...{{delay8}}and it didn't
let up.{{delay8}} So I left the road and took shelter
in this stable.{{delay8}} And here I still am.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}When the cold is severe, take shelter in
a building like this to {{color id="0"}}protect yourself
from the elements{{color id="-1"}}.
Or shelter...{{delay8}}in {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}} They're warmer
than you'd think. Cozy, even!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Watch out though—there are some
{{color id="0"}}cold caves{{color id="-1"}} that are just as freezing as
the weather is outside!

again?{{delay8}} I guess we're both still waiting
for this blizzard to stop.
