{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Eating"}}Tasting food is part of a chef's grand
work, ya know. So until I'm done tasting
this here marbled rock roast...
the joint's closed! That includes anything
on the Hylian menu.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That marbled rock roast isn't for sale!


Pesky little Hylian.

---
label: Talk_12

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}That's still cooking on the flame!
It's pipin' hot!

label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Seems like Mr. {{color id="0"}}Gomo {{color id="-1"}}is unhappy...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Welcome to Bedrock Bistro, a favorite
among even the most selective foodies.
Like our esteemed Mr. Gomo!

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The food for Hylians is prepared with less
crunch, more give.

You can order anything you like right from
the grill.

Gomo?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh...did you overhear that?

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}If you're that interested in Mr. Gomo,
he's out in front of the restaurant.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}When the marbled rock roast showed
up on the scene, I was downright coarse
to him.
So I've kinda been avoiding him
altogether...

I'm hoping to find some {{color id="0"}}ripened flint{{color id="-1"}}
to offer him, by way of apology.
It's his favorite.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Gomo the goromand is a very special
guest here at the bistro.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I heard about the whole mess with us
Gorons recently, and, well, I feel plain
awful about it.
{{anim type="Think"}}I think it started once the marbled rock
roast showed up, but I don't remember
too well...
All I can do now is try to smooth things
over by preparing Mr. Gomo's favorite—
{{color id="0"}}ripened{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}flint{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But it's hard to come by...

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Rock roast{{color id="-1"}} is in short supply, as usual.


There are some in the caves around here,
but the footholds collapsed, and they
can't keep a steady supply coming.
So if you find some, please bring it to me.

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's cooked to perfection now. Try it!

---
label: Talk_15

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This is when the flavors really get
rolling. Dee-lish.

label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thanks to you, our Hylian menu is sold
out as well.

I'll stock up again soon, and I'll make sure
it's cooked to perfection.
