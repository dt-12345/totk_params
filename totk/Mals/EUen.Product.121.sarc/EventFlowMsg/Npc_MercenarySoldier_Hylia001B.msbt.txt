{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh!{{delay8}} It's you, Link! Pardon me for being
lost in my work here. This {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} tends
to get all my attention.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you interested in the different
peoples of Hyrule and where they live?
That's my entire field of study.
When I'm out on a deployment with the
monster-control crew, I spend hours
poring over our maps.
As such, I'm the most knowledgeable in
Lookout Landing about Hyrule's {{color id="0"}}various
peoples{{color id="-1"}} and their {{color id="0"}}towns and villages{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, Link! Will you be leaving?{{delay8}}


Smart thinking, taking off when the night
monsters go to sleep. Just as I'd expect.

---
label: Talk_0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, Link! Good morning!{{delay8}} Will you be
heading out?

---
label: Talk_0042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, Link!{{delay8}} Will you be heading out?

---
label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, Link! Might you be heading out?{{delay8}}


Right when the night monsters begin
to rouse. Brave of you, as always.

---
label: Talk_0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Thank you for all you do.


While we're stunned that the Demon King
is back, we won't allow it to dampen the
spirits of the monster-control crew!
I imagine you may be heading out shortly.

---
label: Talk_0040
---
It would be a complicating factor if you
get lost during your travels. Please make
sure to check your {{color id="0"}}destination{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm quite confident in my knowledge of
Hyrule's {{color id="0"}}peoples and places{{color id="-1"}}.

So if there's anything you're wondering
about its {{color id="0"}}various peoples {{color id="-1"}}or their
{{color id="0"}}towns and villages{{color id="-1"}}, please ask!

---
label: 0008
---
Its various peoples?

---
label: Talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Aside from us Hylians, there are four
other peoples here in Hyrule.

The Rito,{{delay8}} the Gorons,{{delay8}} the Zora,{{delay8}} and
the Gerudo.

Each live in a different area and have their
own unique traits—whether it's soaring
the sky or feasting on rocks.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We Hylians also live in villages that
reflect our unique cultures.

The {{color id="0"}}Sheikah{{color id="-1"}} are renowned for their
wisdom. In fact, our most prolific
researchers are among them.
The leader of Lookout Landing, Purah,
is from the Sheikah tribe.

---
Towns and villages?

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hyrule has eight major places that its
various peoples call home.

---
label: Talk_0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Lookout Landing is located here in
Central Hyrule.

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Up northwest of here, there's Rito Village
in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then there's Gerudo Town. That's located
to the southwest in the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo{{color id="-1"}} region.

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You'll find Goron City to the northeast
in {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Travel a bit farther east, and you'll come
across Tarrey Town in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not too far from there is Zora's Domain.
That's within the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru{{color id="-1"}} region.

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Continuing into southeast Hyrule, you'll
come across a cluster of Hylian villages.
These are within an area called {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Within that cluster, you'll find Kakariko
Village, where the {{color id="0"}}Sheikah {{color id="-1"}}live.{{delay8}} I hear the
village leader is quite lovely.

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're seeking a tranquil spot, Hateno
Village is worth a visit.{{delay8}} I also hear it's
become Hyrule's {{color id="0"}}center of fashion{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Finally, there's Lurelin Village. It's a
wonderful getaway destination.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Many of the aforementioned towns and
villages have been deeply affected by
the Upheaval.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If removing even a fraction of the
monsters helps soothe the peoples of
Hyrule, then that's what we'll do.
Our monster-control crew is on patrol
each day, gathering information from
everyone...{{delay8}}everywhere.

---
label: 0010
---
What about you?

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I work with the monster-control crew.{{pageBreak}}We're tasked with protecting everyone
from monsters. There's been an uptick in
their populations since the Upheaval.
But I'm not really the most skilled
in combat.{{pageBreak}}So instead, I use my knowledge of the
areas to help determine where we should
make deployments.

---
label: 0000
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}There's been an increase in the number of
{{color id="0"}}unfamiliar monsters{{color id="-1"}} since the Upheaval,
as well. Be careful out there.

---
label: Talk_0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Now that the Gerudo have come to offer
their support, Lookout Landing has
stronger defenses than ever before.
Even so...there's been an increase in the
number of {{color id="0"}}unfamiliar monsters{{color id="-1"}} since
the Upheaval. Be careful out there.

---
label: Talk_0048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Thanks to you, Link, things have gotten
very busy here! It's become quite the hub
for everyone.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}All the people of Hyrule are banding
together, and united we can stand against
any threat, including the Demon King!

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh! If you're interested, I'm happy to
oblige you!

---
label: Talk_0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you're curious about them, I'm happy to
indulge that curiosity!

---
label: Talk_0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Well... I don't like to talk about myself
that much, buuut...

I'm with the monster-control crew.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Our role is to keep everyone safe, what
with the rise in monster attacks after
the Upheaval.
But I'm not a warrior at heart.{{pageBreak}}I use my knowledge of the peoples and
places of Hyrule to help the monster-
control crew deploy its forces.

---
label: Talk_OnTheDesk
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You can see the map better from up there.
I do that myself when no one is watching!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But there are some important documents
laid out too, so please watch your step.
