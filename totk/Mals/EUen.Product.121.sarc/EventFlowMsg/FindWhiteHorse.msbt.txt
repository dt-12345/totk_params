What rotten luck...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}Oh, {{color id="0"}}Spot{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} Where did you get off to?

---
label: 0000
---
Spot?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Well, look who it is. {{delay8}}I sure can't thank
you enough for helping our mini stable
come together.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Heard me talking to myself, did you?{{pageBreak}}Spot is the name of my beloved horse,
you see...

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Well, look who it is. Overheard my
worrying, did you? Spot's my horse.

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Truth be told, he's missing. Ran away just
before the stable was built.

Well, he's always been a meek horse,
so I {{color id="0"}}can't imagine he's run off too far{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}He's beautiful. Just one look at his silky,
{{color id="0"}}gentle beige {{color id="-1"}}coat and you'd know it
was him.
Course, you'd recognize his unique {{color id="0"}}gray
dappling{{color id="-1"}} too. That's the reason I call him
Spot in the first place!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}A horse like him, I bet you he's someplace
with a nice view, taking in the sights.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Just wish I didn't have so much trouble
climbing to {{color id="0"}}high places{{color id="-1"}} these days.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}He ran off on me just before the stables
were built.

I call him Spot because of his unique
{{color id="0"}}gray dappling{{color id="-1"}}. He's one of a kind.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Worse yet, he's caught in this lousy rain...

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I hope this thunder doesn't scare him...

---
label: 0001
---
Good luck with that.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}If only I'd kept a better eye on him...

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}His coat's a gentle {{color id="0"}}beige with gray
dappling{{color id="-1"}}. Hence the name.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I bet that if you went {{color id="0"}}somewhere with a
good view{{color id="-1"}}, you'd find him in no time.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I would go look myself, but climbing up
high isn't so easy for me anymore...

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Spot! It's really you! {{delay8}}Are you hurt?
Hungry?

Oh, Spot...{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You had me worried sick. What if you were
attacked by monsters out there?

---
label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} H-hey...{{delay8}} Isn't that Spot you've
got there?!

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Ah, my apologies... {{delay8}}Spot here is a dear
friend of mine.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Thing is, he ran away just before this
stable was built...

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Well, it looks like I'm in your debt yet
again. Thank you so much for bringing
my Spot back to me.
It's not much, but here's a little reward
for reuniting me with my best friend.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Running around under that big blue sky,
mane blowing in the wind...munching on
grass with the rest of his herd...
I really can't blame Spot for wanting to
live like a wild horse again.{{delay30}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I'm sorry. I know you went through all that
trouble to bring him back to me...

But he deserves a freer life than I can give
him. It's time for me to let him go.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Or maybe I should give him to a fine
young horseman like yourself. As long
as he's happy, I'll be happy.
Oh, that reminds me. Please, take this.

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm? Seems like your pouch is full up.


I was planning on rewarding you with a
{{color id="0"}}swift carrot{{color id="-1"}}. They're pretty rare around
these parts, you know.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'd appreciate it if you'd come see me
again after you free up some space.

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Huh. Your pouch still looks full there.


Well, once you make some room, I still
have a {{color id="0"}}swift carrot {{color id="-1"}}with your name on it.
They're pretty rare around here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'd be glad if you came back again after
you freed up some space.

---
label: Talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So you freed up some pouch space, huh?
Great. Then this is all yours.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That there is a {{color id="0"}}swift carrot{{color id="-1"}}.


It's a signature crop of {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}in
Necluda, down to the southeast of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Hylian or horse, you take a bite of one of
those, and you'll find a little more pep in
your step.
{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Spot and I used to split swift carrots
all the time back in the day...

{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It would make me happy if you split that
with your favorite horse too.
