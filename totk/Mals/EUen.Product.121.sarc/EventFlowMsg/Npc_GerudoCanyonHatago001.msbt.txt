Gotta go.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Wait, really?!{{delay8}} Did you seriously bring me
a {{color id="0"}}picture of the smiling Spectacle Rock{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'd even be fine seeing someone else's
painting of {{color id="0"}}the smiling Spectacle Rock{{color id="-1"}}.
That way, I could at least copy it!

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If you happen to have a picture of {{color id="0"}}the
smiling Spectacle Rock{{color id="-1"}}, I'd be really glad
if you showed it to me!

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Yes...{{delay8}} Yes, I knew this sight would be just
the thing to cheer me up! {{delay8}}Reminds me of
when this place was full of smiles.
Still, if you ever have a different picture
of {{color id="0"}}Spectacle Rock smiling{{color id="-1"}}, I'd be happy to
copy it down and put it up instead.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just let me know when you want to see
something else in this lovely frame!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It really does look like it's smiling!{{delay8}}
Hee-hee...{{delay8}} Every time I look at it,
I smile too!
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Things got a little lonely around here once
the stable closed, but having this here
makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

---
label: Change_Photo_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}So, {{delay8}}did you want to do something with
that {{color id="0"}}smiling Spectacle Rock picture{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Change_Photo_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Ah, {{delay8}}any thoughts about that {{color id="0"}}picture of
the giant sword{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You brought a smile to my stable wall and
to my face as well!

Now I feel like I can finally finish cleaning
this place up. Thank you!

---
label: Com_Photo_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Wow! With two great pictures, {{delay8}}this stable
is practically a museum!

---
label: Com_Photo_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}If only I had beds for any visitors...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I gotta say,{{delay8}} looking at that picture always
puts a grin on my face.

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Now that I've got this awesome {{color id="0"}}picture of
the giant sword{{color id="-1"}} on the wall, the stable
itself feels happier!
Thank you, truly!

label: Com_Photo_21

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}There are all sorts of rumors about that
sword. Nobody knows who made it, when
it came from, or how it was used.
Some even think that it was wielded in
battle. But who could be big enough to
swing something like that around?
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Maybe when I close this stable for good, I should
take a trip to see the sword in person...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Oh, sorry, {{delay8}}got lost in thought there.

---
label: 9006

Let's swap the picture.

---
label: 9007
---
Looks good to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}It turns out the Stable Association sent
me two frames by mistake.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Kind of ironic, given we're about to close.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But far be it from me to look a gift horse
in the mouth. I might as well use the other
frame to bid the stable farewell in style.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I think a picture of the {{color id="0"}}giant sword {{color id="-1"}}stuck
into {{color id="0"}}a peak in the Gerudo Highlands {{color id="-1"}}is
the neat goodbye this stable deserves.{{color id="0"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="-1"}}It's just northwest of here, {{delay8}}but I won't be
able to go see it. I have cleaning to do.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}Besides, it's COLD in the Gerudo Highlands...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Even a copied picture of the {{color id="0"}}giant sword{{color id="-1"}}
would liven up this old place.

label: Com_Photo_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What's that?{{delay8}} You have a {{color id="0"}}picture of the
giant sword{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'd like to give this stable an appropriately
cool farewell by putting something really
exciting in that frame.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And just northwest of here, there's a {{color id="0"}}giant
sword{{color id="-1"}} sticking out of {{color id="0"}}a mountain peak in
the Gerudo Highlands{{color id="-1"}}! It'd be perfect!{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Unfortunately, {{delay8}}there's no way I'll ever be
able to go see it. I need to clean the
stable, and it's COLD in those highlands.

---
label: Com_Photo_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I wish I had a picture of that {{color id="0"}}huge sword{{color id="-1"}}
stuck into the peak of {{color id="0"}}the mountain in
the Gerudo Highlands{{color id="-1"}}.
This stable deserves to have something
neat on its wall to see it off, y'know?

---
label: Com_Photo_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh?{{delay8}} Did you bring me a {{color id="0"}}drawing of the
giant sword{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If only I had a {{color id="0"}}picture of the giant sword{{color id="-1"}}
to look at, I could just copy it!

---
label: Com_Photo_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}This is a great picture, but if you happen
to have {{color id="0"}}one of the giant sword{{color id="-1"}}, I'd love to
see it!

---
label: Com_Photo_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}So it's called "the Forgotten Sword"?
Even abandoned in a harsh land, it still
cuts an imposing figure...{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And so do I! There's fight in me yet!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}If you've got {{color id="0"}}pictures of the giant sword{{color id="-1"}},
show 'em to me, and I'll copy and display
whichever you want!
Just let me know if you want to swap out!

---
label: Com_Photo_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So this is the giant sword, huh? It's so
much bigger than I ever imagined!

{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I knew it was out there, but finally getting
my eyes on it... Wow, just wow!
