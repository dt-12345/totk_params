{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Ho ho ho...{{delay frames="30" otherArg="0x0000"}} It was you, wasn't it?
You're the one who gave me that
endura carrot.
For so long my stomach has been
torturously empty.{{pageBreak}}Thanks to you, I at last had the energy to
emerge from my bud. You have my thanks.{{pageBreak}}My name is {{color id="0"}}Malanya{{color id="-1"}}. I am the god who

first meal in so long, my appetite still

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Hahaha, I jest... You do not
look appetizing.{{pageBreak}}Another endura carrot ought to do.

---
label: Talk19_02

In exchange, I can {{color id="0"}}grant your wishes{{color id="-1"}}...{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
Those related to horses, at least.

---
label: 0015

You grant wishes?

I'm not sure...

---
label: Talk19_03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Yes... I can {{color id="0"}}revive {{color id="-1"}}loyal steeds that have

---
label: Talk19_04

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Why the hesitation? I assure you, there is
no need to be frightened...

---
label: Talk19_05

But if you want me to use my powers,
bring adequate compensation...
Bring {{color id="0"}}food{{color id="-1"}}.
I don't want just any food either.
Yes, that endura carrot you gave me
was tasty enough...
But you... {{delay8}}You don't only eat carrots.
Neigh!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Your food is better, isn't it?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}I want some of those... {{delay8}}What are they

Uh...

---
label: Talk19_06

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}...What?{{pageBreak}}Why are you looking at me like that?
This is not about me wanting to eat
tasty meals...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}"The god of horses cannot revive on
an empty stomach." Generation after
generation has repeated that saying.
It means that if you want me to enhance
or revive a virtuous steed, you must give
me food.
Now then, what brings you here?
What do you need?

---
label: Talk20

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ah... It's you. What brings you here?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Do you have any other business?

---
label: 0010

Enhance a horse.

Revive a horse.

---
label: 0014
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hm. I'm sorry, but you already have so
many hoofed friends.

If I revived one, there would be too many
for you to take care of.

So, I can do this, but only if you agree to
let a steed go. Will you do that?

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Well then. Which horse do you want
to release?

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now, to bring back your fallen companion.

---
label: 0002
---
...Yes.

---
label: 0003
---
No.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If you set free this equine companion,
you may never see it again. You're sure?

---
label: 0004

Yep, I'm sure!

---
label: 0005
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Then I shall free this horse.


No need to worry...{{delay8}} They are
strong-willed creatures and more than
capable of surviving on their own.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You do not want to revive a horse, then?

---
label: 0006

Let me check...

---
label: 0007
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Which horse do you want to revive?

---
label: Talk05
---
This is the horse you'd like to revive?

---
label: 0008
---
Yes, please!

---
label: 0009
---
Let me check...

---
label: Talk06

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Select a loyal friend to bring back...

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}...Hm! I see you're good with horses.
All seems to be well.

The friendship you established with
a horse really is extraordinary.

Remember that such a friendship is
a two-way road. Horses care for you
as much as you do for them.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}As I told you before...all is well. You have
no horses in need of reviving.

Horses are your friends. Look after them,
and they will look after you.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh dear. This horse seems to have been
struck by lightning. How tragic.

Acts of nature are rare and difficult to
account for... You are not at fault.

Though I might suggest you avoid wearing
attire that attracts lightning so that this
tragedy does not occur again.

---
label: Talk09_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You would like to revive this horse?
This one, specifically?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I can do that, of course!{{delay15}} But wait...
{{delay8}}What is this...

This horse says that YOU killed it! {{delay8}}You!
How could you?!

Are horses only a tool to you? {{delay8}}Do you
treat their noble lives so casually that
you'd use them and throw them away?
Do you plan to revive it just to kill
it again?

---
label: Talk09_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Shall I do the same to you?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk09_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I...jest.


You accidentally struck the horse,
I'm sure.

---
label: Talk10_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hm... Would you like to revive this horse?{{pageBreak}}Oh, goodness! It was caught in an
explosion? Poor soul...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Not to cast suspicion where none is
warranted, but...you didn't kill the horse,
did you?

---
label: Talk10_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It couldn't be the case. I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hm. I can tell that this horse died due to
an unexpected accident. Worry not, this
happens from time to time.
The horse knows that you did not mean
for this to happen.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ah, understood! Let me bring back
this horse!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Neigh! A horse, loyal and true, has
fallen during your adventures!

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}{{size value="125"}}I could end you, right here!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I jest... Well then, which horse do you
want to revive?

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Wait. Where is it? Where is the {{color id="0"}}roasted
endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}?

To revive your steed, I will require one of
those delicious, earthy vegetables...

Or did you expect me to do it without
being properly fed?

Come back here with a {{color id="0"}}roasted endura
carrot{{color id="-1"}}, and I will revive your horse.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm...{{delay15}} It seems this will not be possible.


You can see the reason for yourself.{{delay15}}
Or must I explain everything?

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Your horse is already outstanding in
all respects. {{delay15}}Even I cannot enhance its
abilities further.

---
label: Talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}...Wait. You don't have even one horse?
How strange...

In that case, I cannot do anything for you.
Visit me again when you have bonded
with a horse.

---
label: Talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}...As I said, you appear not to have even
one horse to your name.

I suggest you find one, befriend it, and
then come see me.

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}...What are you saying? You do not seem
to have any horses registered.

You didn't kill a horse that wasn't yours,
did you? {{delay15}}Surely not.

In any case, I can do nothing for you.
Please visit me again after you have
bonded with a horse.

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}...Have you not been listening? I said you
have no horses.

Should you form a friendship with a
horse and then lose your dear steed,
come see me.

---
label: Talk1001

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Choose a loyal steed to receive
my blessings...

to improve?

Hm... Did you mean to choose a

Let me think...

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That's fine. Take your time.

---
label: Talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}That ability cannot be enhanced any more
than it already is.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}I can only enhance horses to a certain
point, you understand. Lest they become
more powerful than even me.

---
label: Talk1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You didn't bring enough food, did you?


It merely slipped your mind, I'm sure.
In any case, I cannot enhance horses
without adequate nutrition.

---
label: Talk1004_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}How scrumptious that looks... Yes, that
will be sufficient for me to enhance your
horse's speed.
Ready, set...

---
label: Talk1004_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}In exchange for that appetizing meal,
I will enhance your horse's stamina.

Ready, set...

---
label: Talk1004_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}How delicious it looks... For that, I will be
happy to enhance your horse's strength.

Ready, set...

---
label: Talk1004_03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Mmm... That looks delicious. Very well.
I will enhance your horse's pull.{{pageBreak}}Ready, set...

---
label: Talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I enhanced its strength!

Your horse's constitution will now be
more robust—its body more resilient.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}It seems pleased with its new abilities.

---
label: Talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I enhanced its speed!

Your horse will now be able to run farther
and faster than ever before.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}It looks excited to go for a gallop.

---
label: Talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I enhanced its stamina!

---
label: Talk1014_00

Your horse should now be able to dash
more often without tiring out.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}It looks quite grateful too.

---
label: Talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I enhanced its pull!

---
label: Talk1018_00

Your horse will now be able to drag
heavier objects.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Look at it proudly flexing its muscles.

---
label: Talk1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}While I'm at it, would you like me to
enhance any other horses' abilities?

---
label: Talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm?{{delay15}} This steed says {{delay8}}it does not want to
have its abilities enhanced.

I see that the horse has the noble air
about it. As its companion, it is your duty
to always respect its feelings.
