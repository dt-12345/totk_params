{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome to Bedrock Bistro.


Ours is the finest restaurant in Hyrule,
specializing in gourmet roasts.

Whether you're a Goron or Hylian, I have
every confidence you'll be salivating
for more.
If you're hankerin' for a steak, please
order directly from the grill.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have to say, I'm relieved you're a Hylian.


Right now, {{color id="0"}}rock roast {{color id="-1"}}is in short supply,
and I don't know if I have enough to keep
up with demand for the Gorons.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I can't go get supplies myself at the
moment, so I'm in a bit of a bind.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Welcome to Bedrock Bistro.


Ours is the finest restaurant in all of
Eldin. Wait, no... All of Hyrule! Here we
specialize in gourmet roasts.
Whether you're a Goron or Hylian, I have
every confidence you'll be salivating
for more.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have to say, I'm relieved you're a Hylian.


Y'see, right now {{color id="0"}}rock roast {{color id="-1"}}is in short
supply, and I don't know if I have enough
to keep up with demand for the Gorons.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I can't go get supplies myself at the
moment, so I'm in a bit of a bind.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And...I'm sorry, but we're also sold out of
food for Hylians... But I should be able to
get some pretty soon here.
You'll just need to wait awhile.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}By the way, I couldn't help notice...


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You've got an interesting thing goin' on
with that rock roast.

In that state, I wouldn't be able to use it
in my cooking.

But if you happen to have any untainted
rock roast, then I'd be happy if you gave
it to me.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}In exchange, I'd cook you our

Rock roast?

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Rock roast is the greatest thing to happen
to Hyrule.

Yes, indeed. It is the finest of edible
delicacies and a necessity for us Gorons.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}I put down some tracks {{color id="-1"}}so we could load
up on stock easily.

But even with the tracks, it can be a
challenge for Gorons to collect rock roast.
