This map... Hmm.

I just don't get it.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Hey! You're a voe, aren't you?


So the rumors were true! There is a voe
in town.

You don't look like the voe dummies from
the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}} class{{color id="-1"}} though.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But I guess you look like how I imagine a
voe looks.

Anyway! I'm Pearle. Nice to meet you!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This is {{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}! She's a vai who became
my sister recently.

Well, I mean...{{delay15}} Not like my blood-related
sister. But I think of her like she's family!

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}By the way, my actual older sister is
a scholar! Isn't that incredible?

I think that I'll become a scholar, too,
when I grow up!

label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}Pearle!


You know you're not yet allowed to talk
to voe!

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}And you, voe. If you need something,
could you speak with me instead?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hey, mister voe. Do you know what this
wall painting means?

Aaqlet says it's some kind of {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}...


But it doesn't match anything in the
{{color id="0"}}shelter {{color id="-1"}}at all!

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The painting on this wall is supposed to
be a {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} of some kind...

But it {{color id="0"}}doesn't match anything in the
shelter {{color id="-1"}}at all!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hmmm...{{delay8}} It'd be amazing proof of my scholarly
potential if I could solve this puzzle...{{size value="100"}}

Ah! I'm gonna be late!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}I got all caught up looking at that
"secret map" of Aaqlet's and made
myself late!
{{color id="0"}}Ms. Ashai{{color id="-1"}} is scary when she gets mad!
I need to hurry to class!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Shhh, don't talk to me right now! If {{color id="0"}}Ms.{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Ashai{{color id="-1"}} sees me talking to you...

So difficult...

---
label: talk0028

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I'm so tired... Voe are more difficult to
understand than any puzzle...

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}So tired... Voe behavior doesn't make
any sense at all...

label: talk0015

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_01"}}Today I had to study how voe make decisions, and I
tried to figure out the map's mysteries... I used my
brain so much...{{delay15}} I need to sleep.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}I want to be a great scholar... {{delay8}}I'll be just
like Rotana...

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}I always feel so safe when others are
sleeping nearby... But then I oversleep,
and I can't be late for class!
If I am, {{color id="0"}}Ms. Ashai{{color id="-1"}} will be mad! I need
to hurry!

label: talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}My sister, Rotana, told me that
{{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}} has been doing {{color id="0"}}mysterious
divinations {{color id="-1"}}lately!
I'm completely stumped on Aaqlet's
secret map-puzzle thing, so...

I think I'll go try and figure out the
mystery surrounding Patricia instead!

I need to make it to Patricia before it
gets dark.

I'll see you later! Sav'orq!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Did you come here to listen to Patricia
make {{color id="0"}}mysterious divinations{{color id="-1"}}?

I heard that she gives them if you give her
a {{color id="0"}}splash fruit{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But all she shares are strange numbers!
I don't understand what she's trying to
say at all.
Could it be some kind of secret code?
Maybe a location?

{{size value="80"}}Hmmm. It'd be amazing proof of my scholarly
potential if I could solve this puzzle...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You can hear Patricia's {{color id="0"}}mysterious
divinations{{color id="-1"}} if you offer her some
{{color id="0"}}splash fruit{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But all she shares are {{color id="0"}}strange numbers{{color id="-1"}}! {{delay15}}
I wonder if it's some kind of secret code...

Maybe it somehow points to a {{color id="0"}}location{{color id="-1"}}?
