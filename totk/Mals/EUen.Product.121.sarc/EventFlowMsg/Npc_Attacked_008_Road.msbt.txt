{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh, hello! {{delay8}}It's me!


Um, y'know, Nat. I'm usually with my little
sister, Meghyn. We were looking for the
mushroom haven!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thanks for helping us out with the tent
and the mushrooms!

It's because of you that the mushroom-
haven mystery is solved!

Meghyn and I are traveling separately
for now. We're each trying to discover
new mushrooms.
There's no way I'm going to let her find
some before I do. What kind of big sister
would I be if I let her beat me to it?

---
label: FriendGreet_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hi again!


My little sister, Meghyn, and I split up to
see if we can discover new types of
mushrooms. Can you help me out?
Just kidding! I want to know I beat her all
by myself.

---
label: FriendGreet_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I didn't think I'd see you again!


Meghyn's also off looking for mushrooms
somewhere. I wonder how she's doing...

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}*sigh* I wonder how Meghyn is doing...


Is she OK by herself? Is she finding new
mushroom types?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}We've never split up like this.


But...she's got a good head on her
shoulders.{{delay8}} Just, um, don't tell her I
said that.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}She's probably doing just fine selling the
mushrooms she finds.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Meghyn is surprisingly dependable. I trust
her to stay out of trouble!

She's probably happily selling all the
mushrooms she's found on her travels.

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}See all these trees? Mushrooms like to
grow in places like this.

You'll also find fruits and herbs and
things, but who cares about that when
there are all these perfect mushrooms?

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Isn't the forest incredible? It provides all
sorts of things, from fruit to herbs...{{delay15}}

But I barely think about that when there
are mushrooms to find!

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}The rain might slow down my search...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But it's so good for mushrooms!
Bring it on!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}When I think about those happy
mushrooms sucking up the rain,
taking a break is no big deal!

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}All this traveling is giving me lots of
new ideas.{{delay15}}

Like, what if there are mushrooms on
the sky islands? Ones that don't grow
anywhere else?
If I was a Rito, I'd explore every island.

---
label: GoRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}There may be undiscovered mushrooms
on the sky islands... But there are plenty
for me to find on the ground too!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}When I spend too long on the ground, I
start itching to go climbing for rushrooms.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's not only the rushrooms I want—it's
also the thrill of climbing a cliff to
pick them.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Why do you think the rushrooms growing
on cliffs are so wonderful?

Whenever I see one, it's hard to keep my
feet on the ground.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I know there aren't SUPPOSED to be any
mushrooms in the fields, but what if
there ARE?
Wouldn't it be awful if I overlooked one
just because I didn't think it could exist?

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Mushrooms like trees, not big empty
stretches of grass. Looking in fields
might be useless...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But what if I miss one? {{delay8}}I'd never
forgive myself.

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Maybe it's time to explore the
caves again...

Some mushrooms only grow in caves,
and Satori Mountain isn't far from here.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Some mushrooms only grow in dark
places, so exploring caves is inevitable.

I haven't been to Satori Mountain yet,
so that sounds like a good place to
head next.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wonder what Meghyn is up to...


Mushrooms make me think about
Meghyn, and Meghyn makes me think
about mushrooms.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Mushrooms aren't sticky, usually...but
they're what holds us together.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It'll always be just the three of us—me,
Meghyn, and mushrooms.

label: Near_GoalPoint_01
---
Meghyn...

---
label: Near_StartPoint_01
---
Mushrooms... Hmm...

---
label: Near_RainPoint_01
---
Bring on the rain!

---
label: Near_Rain
---
Oooh, rain!

---
label: Near_Thunder
---
Thunder?!

---
label: Near_RestPoint_01

On that sky island...

---
label: Near_BackRange_01
---
Even on cliffs...

---
label: Near_BackRange_02
---
They're in the grass too...

---
label: Near_GoRange_01
---
Caves are good spots...

When I see a mushroom...
