Sonia...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_001_c
---
Oh, Zelda...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_002_c
---
King Rauru... Before you face the Demon King
tomorrow, there is something I must tell you.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_003_c
---
I came... I came to this era after finding a
man underground.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_004_b
---
Hm.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_005_b
---
Go on.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_006_d
---
When I witnessed what the secret stone did to
Ganondorf... At that moment, I knew for sure.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_007_c
---
What we found underground—that was him!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_008_c
---
He was still alive... Still powerful...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_009_d
---
He continues to live on...all the way until my time!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_010_c
---
In tomorrow's battle...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_011_bb
---
We won't be able to defeat him. No matter how strong
we think we are, he'll survive!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_012_ac
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_012_c
---
And you... And you will...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_013_c
---
Maybe so...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_014_c
---
But it is my duty to try.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_015_b
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_017_c
---
It was my hubris that set us on this path.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_018_c
---
I must atone for my error in judgment.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_019_c
---
And above all else...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_020_c
---
I remain the king of Hyrule. As with any leader, it is
my duty to safeguard and protect my people.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_021_c
---
Even if I must risk my life.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_022_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_022_b
---
Rauru...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_023_c
---
And if it proves impossible for us to
defeat Ganondorf...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_024_c
---
we rely on your knight...and that legendary sword
he carries.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_025_c
---
Our last line of defense will be Link.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_026_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_026_c
---
But remember, that was a future where you never
appeared in this world. And you are here now.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_027_c
---
Zelda... I believe there is a reason you were sent
to us. It has to mean something.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0008_Text_028_b
---
The reason I...am here...
