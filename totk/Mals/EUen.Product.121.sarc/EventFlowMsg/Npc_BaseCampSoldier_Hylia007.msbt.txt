{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Huh? Link?!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}You're back! I thought things felt different
around here!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I knew you'd escape the castle. You are
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}'s swordsman, after all!{{pageBreak}}By the way, where's the princess? I can't
wait to welcome her back!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I see... {{delay15}}So she's still missing...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, it's a big relief having you back.{{pageBreak}}I'm sure you've been through a lot,
returning to us. So, just know that
Lookout Landing is here for you.
Be sure to get some rest, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm so relieved to see you back at
last, Link!{{pageBreak}}The journey here must have been
difficult. Please, get whatever rest you
need here at Lookout Landing.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Poor {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}. She must still be
stuck in Hyrule Castle.{{pageBreak}}We have to rescue her... But how do we
get up there?

label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If I could, I'd go and save Princess Zelda
myself right now.{{pageBreak}}But how can I get to Hyrule Castle?
It's so high up!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hello, Link! I was hoping you'd come up
and talk to me.

To be honest, I saw you from the top of
the wall as soon as you got back.

You looked a little preoccupied, so I
decided not to say anything.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Anyway, you looked brilliant soaring
through the sky just now!

We're short on workers, so I actually
helped construct the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}.

Ever since it was finished, we all
wondered who'd be brave enough to
launch for the first time.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Should've guessed it would be you.

label: Talk_12

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}You looked so heroic when you soared
from our {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} here!

I helped construct the tower, since we're
short on workers.

Ever since it was finished, we all
wondered who'd be brave enough
to launch for the first time.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Of course it was you, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Princess Zelda must still be stuck up
there in {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}I wonder. If I used the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}},
could I launch high enough to... No,
that won't work.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm so scared of heights—even being
up here makes me a bit trembly.

No, never mind.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Link! Did you hear? {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}was
spotted up in Hyrule Castle!{{pageBreak}}We need to get her down somehow!
It's not safe being that high up!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Grrr...{{delay8}} Curse my debilitating fear
of heights!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If I was even a foot higher than this, my
legs would be stone stiff right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Poor Princess Zelda, stuck way up there
all on her own!{{pageBreak}}We have to go get her soon!
