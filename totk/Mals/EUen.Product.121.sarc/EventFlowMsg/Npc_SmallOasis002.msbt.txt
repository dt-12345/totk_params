{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, goodmortta—{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, forgive me. Mixed up my languages
there. That was one part "good morning"
and one part "sav'otta."
Perhaps I have been out here too long...

---
label: talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Well, good'aaq—


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Dear me. I accidentally combined "good
day" with the Gerudo "sav'aaq" there.

Perhaps I've lived here too long...

---
label: talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, goodevaaba—


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No, that isn't right. I just combined "good
evening" with the Gerudo "sav'saaba"...

A sign I've been here too long, perhaps...

label: talk1012

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Which reminds me, I've heard all sorts of new
greetings lately, like "votta" and "sav'a"... 
Should I be using those instead?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Another Hylian stranded by the {{color id="0"}}sand
shroud{{color id="-1"}}, I take it?{{delay8}} How challenging life
without wings must be.
The {{color id="0"}}higher{{color id="-1"}} you go, the {{color id="0"}}thinner {{color id="-1"}}the shroud
gets, so we{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}Rito can soar right over it.

For us, it's little more than a sandy fog.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Life without wings must be hard for
you Hylians.

The sand shroud's no trouble for {{color id="0"}}Rito{{color id="-1"}} like
me. We can simply {{color id="0"}}fly over it{{color id="-1"}}.

Sand shroud?

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you seen the thick layer of sand
over the desert? That is the sand shroud.

Should you be caught in it, not only will it
obscure your vision but it will also make
your compass go haywire.
Thanks to that updraft over there,
however, this oasis is secure.

I've never been inside the sand shroud,
myself. We{{color id="0"}} Rito{{color id="-1"}} can simply {{color id="0"}}fly over it{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Goodvorq...


*sigh* I did it again. That was one part
"goodbye" and one part "sav'orq."

label: talk0024

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be careful not to get your feathers rustled
by the sand shroud.{{pageBreak}}Goodvorq for now.{{pageBreak}}Ugh, sorry. That was a little bit "goodbye"
and a little bit "sav'orq." {{delay15}}Look, you knew
what I meant. Just take care out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'm still recovering from the shock of
seeing those monsters swarming all over
peaceful oasis.
After all these years, I thought the desert
had run out of ways to surprise me.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}At the end of the day, this is where I have
chosen to nest. Goodvorq, old home.

...Goodbye. I meant goodbye. I just mixed
it up with the Gerudo word "sav'orq."

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Another Hylian stranded out here by the
sand shroud, I take it?

Well, the storm has settled now, and
visibility is clear in any direction you
may care to look.
It should be safe for you and your
wingless kin to cross the desert again.

As for me, I've grown fond of this little
oasis. I think I'll bring my {{color id="0"}}family{{color id="-1"}} out here
and make this place our forever nest.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}My wife runs a general store in Rito
Village. I'm not one to brag, but she's the
most beautiful lady you ever will see.
Our son runs a store of his own in some
town or other, but I'm not entirely sure
of all the details.
The town itself was apparently established
fairly recently in northeast Hyrule.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As you might imagine, the two of them
stay very busy, so it may be some time
before we all live together again.

Goodbye.

---
label: talk0018

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that the sand shroud is gone, we
have clear views in every direction.

Crossing the desert should be safe for
you and your wingless kin once more.

As for me, I've grown fond of this oasis.
I plan to bring my {{color id="0"}}family{{color id="-1"}} here so we can
live out our lives in this place.
