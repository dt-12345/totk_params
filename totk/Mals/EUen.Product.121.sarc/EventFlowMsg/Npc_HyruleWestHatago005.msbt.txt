I already know.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Then allow me to explain.


You can board your horse companions

please from our network of stables.
You may have come across {{color id="0"}}wild horses{{color id="-1"}}
during your travels...

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you catch one and ride it here
to register it,{{delay8}} it will become your
horse companion.
There's a limit to how many horses you
can board, but you're able to swap them

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Glad to help.{{delay15}} What would you like to

---
label: QuestionTalk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Anything else I can clarify for you?

---
label: QuestionTalk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, no problem. I'm happy to repeat
myself as many times as you need me to.

---
label: 0056
---
I want to call a horse.

---
label: TalkHatu_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's simple enough. To catch a wild horse,
just approach it from behind—{{delay8}}slowly, so it
doesn't hear you coming—and hop on.
If you really want to be sneaky, approach
it while {{color id="0"}}crouching{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: TalkHatu_07
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Of course, these are {{color id="0"}}wild animals {{color id="-1"}}we're
talking about. The horse you're riding
might start to act up.
If that happens, try soothing it. It will
eventually settle down,{{delay8}} and then you
can bring it to me.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now, it may take a while for wild horses to
get used to being ridden.

They may change directions or slow
down on their own until you earn their
trust and respect.
If your horse disobeys your direction,{{delay8}}
you'll want to gently redirect it, and
then calm it.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}And if you continue interacting that way,
your horse will naturally begin to trust
you and become more obedient.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Speaking of which...{{delay15}} Do you know
about whistling?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}If you get separated from your horse, you

---
label: Register19

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But your horse isn't magic. It can't hear
you if you're too far away, so do keep
that in mind!

---
label: Advice01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're riding on a road, your horse
will just naturally follow the path, as is
its instinct.
Travel by road if you want to leave the
steering up to your steed and just enjoy
the scenery!

---
label: Advice02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If a horse gets spooked or doesn't like
where it's at, it might shut down and
refuse to move at all.
If that happens, you can {{color id="0"}}target{{color id="-1"}} while
mounted and then force the horse to
{{color id="0"}}move step by step{{color id="-1"}}.
Just be sure you don't put your horse
in a dangerous situation.

---
label: Advice03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}To talk to someone while on horseback,{{delay8}}
just {{color id="0"}}target{{color id="-1"}} them first.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you get separated from your horse,
{{delay8}}just {{color id="0"}}whistle{{color id="-1"}} and it'll come running.

label: Advice05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Horses that have lots of {{color id="0"}}stamina{{color id="-1"}} can
run at top speed for a long time.

However, they can't turn well when
they're running at top speed.

If your horse can't turn sharply, you're
more likely to hit obstacles, so think
before you ask your horse to sprint.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then I had an idea.{{delay8}} Lady Impa visited

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Unfortunately, since it's so big, I can't get
