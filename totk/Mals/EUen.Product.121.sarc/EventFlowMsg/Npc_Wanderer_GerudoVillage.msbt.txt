Where is that geoglyph?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hm?{{delay15}} This is the last place I expected to
find you, courageous one.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I came to investigate the local geoglyph,
but the sandstorm scuttled my plans.

Now that it has finally died down, I intend
to resume my search.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}There is also the matter of the temple at
the bottom of the canyon in Hebra.{{pageBreak}}Cado has been studying the relevant
literature and is certain it will aid us
in our search for the geoglyphs.{{pageBreak}}Clearly, we must investigate this
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}We have heard of geoglyphs all across
Hyrule...{{delay15}}but our search for them has been
haphazard at best.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Perhaps a visit to the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}
in that canyon in Hebra could provide us
better guidance.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now, I must finish my preparations and
reunite with Cado.{{pageBreak}}I've left him waiting at the entrance to
town for so long, I will be half-surprised
if he has not left without me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We are on a journey to find every
geoglyph depicted on that map.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Poor Cado had a miserable time copying
the whole thing down.{{pageBreak}}If only we had a camera, he could have
been spared a lot of effort...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh well. No use worrying about that now.
