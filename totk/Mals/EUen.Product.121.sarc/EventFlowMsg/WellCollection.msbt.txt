{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh? What are you doing in a place
like THIS?

Although...{{delay8}}I'm in a place like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Hey, you wouldn't happen to be...{{delay15}}
a {{color id="0"}}well enthusiast{{color id="-1"}}, would you?

---
label: 0004

Of course.

label: 0005

Nope.

label: Talk26

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I thought so.{{delay8}} My name's Fera. I have a
deep love of wells too. 

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Really? I hoped you'd have a deep love
of wells, like I do.{{delay15}} Nice to meet you
anyway. My name's Fera.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Still, you are here. That must mean you
don't mind them. Wells, that is.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Wells are endlessly fascinating.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Their damp environment...{{delay8}}their unique
systems of life...{{delay8}}how they stay cool when
it's hot outside.

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Well enthusiasts just get it. The appeal
of a good well, that is.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}My dream is to travel around to every
single well throughout Hyrule.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}After scouring all the ancient text I could
find on the subject, I've learned that
there are {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="WellDiscoverNumTotal" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} wells{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}Sadly, I haven't been able to identify
their exact locations.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But if you have any interest in wells, then
maybe you could help me. Would you
tell me any {{color id="0"}}well locations{{color id="-1"}} you know of?

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You seem to be a traveler. So if you've
happened to spot any {{color id="0"}}wells{{color id="-1"}}, how
about you tell me their {{color id="0"}}locations{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'll reward you, of course. Hmm...{{delay15}} How
does {{color id="0"}}10 rupees per location{{color id="-1"}} sound?

---
label: 0000

You've got a deal.

---
label: 0001

Not now.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Really? That's fantastic!{{delay15}} All right, then.
Tell me everything!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}Whaaat?{{delay8}} Why keep all those well spots
to yourself?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But, all right...{{delay15}} Let's talk again sometime
if you change your mind.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! I'm going to Lookout Landing next.
There's a well there I want to see!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So, if you learn more well locations,
meet me there. See you around!

label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! I'm going to Lookout Landing next.
There's a well there I'd love to see.{{delay8}}
See you around!

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! I'm still interested in any well spots
you've found. Ready to share them?

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, it's you. This well is nice, isn't it!
Tranquil, in its unique way.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh! Have you reconsidered telling me
what well locations you've been to?

---
label: Near01
---
A new well, also neat!

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, it's you!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm fascinated by the many old wells
across Hyrule, but new wells are pretty
interesting too. Like this one.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! Have you come to tell me about the
location of more wells you've found?

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Do you happen to know of more well
locations? I'd love to know about them.

---
label: 0002
---
Yep! Got more for you.

---
label: 0006
---
No more yet.

---
label: 0003
---
Nothing to share.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks! {{delay8}}So, {{number14 ref="WellReportNumThisTime" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them this time!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'll give you {{color id="0"}}10 rupees{{color id="-1"}} per location.
That's {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="WellCollectionReward" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} rupees{{color id="-1"}} total. All yours!

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I see. That's too bad.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thanks for sharing. I'm excited to go
visit all of these wells!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Let's see...{{delay8}} How many left across Hyrule?
Oh! There's still a total of {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="WellDiscoverNumLeft" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} to find{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thanks for sharing!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Let's see... {{delay8}}How many wells left? Oh!
There's still a total of {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="WellDiscoverNumLeft" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} to find{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Let's chat again if you find any more
well locations.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Hmm, I don't think there are any wells
you haven't told me about before.

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see. This well is the first one you've
discovered. Got it!

Of course, I know about this well too,
but a deal's a deal. One location,
one {{color id="0"}}10 rupee{{color id="-1"}} reward!

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}With that, you've told me the locations
of all {{number14 ref="WellDiscoverNumTotal" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} wells in Hyrule!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}This...{{delay15}}is something I made, when my
love for wells was really brimming over.
Take it, as a gift from me.

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Truly, thank you.{{delay8}}


Now my dream of seeing all these wells
feels so much closer to reality. I hope
to set off on a journey to visit them all!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can find wells all over the place in
{{color id="0"}}towns and stables{{color id="-1"}}, of course.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But even more wells, those used in the
distant past, exist within {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Just imagine! They were a crucial part of
life all that time ago. Isn't that simply
fascinating?

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It can be hard to find old, hidden wells.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If only there was some sort of {{color id="0"}}tool for
searching for things{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Wells hold systems of life that are quite
special, full of {{color id="0"}}plants and creatures
not seen aboveground{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Caves are dimly lit. Maybe that's why.{{delay8}}
Lots of creatures in them have their own
illumination, like the glowing cave fish.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}In their own unique way, wells are very
pleasant. They're nice and {{color id="0"}}cool even if
it's hot outside{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Though rare, {{color id="0"}}Fairy{{color id="-1"}} sightings are possible
inside wells.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}They're floaty and tough to catch, but
you can manage pretty well if you
approach them niiice and sneaky.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sometimes {{color id="0"}}ore deposits{{color id="-1"}} are exposed
inside wells, you know.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It always makes me think that if I just
shattered them somehow, I'd find gems
and strike it rich!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}But I haven't managed to do that—just
too hard for me to break.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I can't wait! Now, which well should I
visit first...
