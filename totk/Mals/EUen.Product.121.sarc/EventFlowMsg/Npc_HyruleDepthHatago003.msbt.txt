A bone horse?!

Gotta finish today...

What a mess...

label: Near_11

Now, where does this go...

---
label: Near_05

I'd be happier as a guide...

Done! It's done!

This is bad, this is bad!

I'll just take a breather...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Things are a bit of a mess around here.
If you need to use the stable, you can
check in at the counter.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Oh! But if you have questions about
routes through the area, then I'm the
guide for you!
If you're passing through here, then you
must be heading to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}, right?

Allow me to offer information about my
{{color id="0"}}regional recommendations{{color id="-1"}}, free of charge!

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ah, it looks like you're interested in my
guide services!

Are you headed to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}? Or do
you want information about my carefully
curated {{color id="0"}}regional recommendations{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Phew. I'm finally done for the day. My
back is killing me after all that cleaning...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But if you're looking for my guiding
services, then I'm fresh as can be! 

Are you headed to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}? Or do
you want information about my carefully
curated {{color id="0"}}regional recommendations{{color id="-1"}}?

Route to Gerudo Town?

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}If it's Gerudo Town you want, then the
safest route is to cross {{color id="0"}}Digdogg Bridge{{color id="-1"}}.

To get there, head right when you leave
the stable, then take another right at the
three-way intersection.
A {{color id="0"}}massive Zonai ruin{{color id="-1"}} fell near the bridge.
That place is swarming with researchers.
You can't miss it.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, you'll have to get through the desert
to reach Gerudo Town.

I've heard an enormous {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} has
blown in and they're locked down tight.

---
label: 0002

Recommendations?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Well then! Have you heard about the
{{color id="0"}}Coliseum Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?

To get to those ruins, first face directly
away from the front of the stable.

Then take a look to the mountain that's
somewhat off to your right. You'll find the
ruins by crossing over it.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}When you stand right in the middle of
the strange, circular ruins and close
your eyes, something happens.
You can hear the battle cry of those
powerful soldiers testing their strength
long, long ago.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hearing that, you can't help feeling a
rush of adventure! I highly recommend
going to those ruins.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Be warned—a truly vicious monster has
settled there.

You'll probably end up testing YOUR
strength against it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ahh, I'm finally back to doing the work
I enjoy.

But don't worry. My humble guiding
services are still available. Is there
anything I can help you with?

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Of course, of course. Directions are
important, after all. I'm happy to go over
them as many times as you need.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I know that stables need a {{color id="0"}}storage space
for building materials{{color id="-1"}}, but it's taking ages
to get it in order.
I hope I can get back to looking after
horses or taking care of customers soon.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}All I do is clean the{{color id="0"}} building material
storage{{color id="-1"}} and trash-disposal area...

This isn't why I wanted to work at a
stable. I hope I can go back to taking
care of horses or something soon.

the rain, too, traveler.
