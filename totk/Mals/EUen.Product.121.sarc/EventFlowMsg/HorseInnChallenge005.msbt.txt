Cluck! Here, Cuccos!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Argh, it's no use! What should I do?
I need to sort this out, and fast, or I'm
going to be in big trouble...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Argh, it's no use! What should I do?
It's raining too... I need to sort this out,
and fast.

What's wrong?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Runaway_01"}}{{size value="125"}}AAAH! Forgive me!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}...Oh! I mistook you for somebody else.
Maybe don't sneak up on a guy who's
clearly having a bad day.
{{size value="80"}}I was sure you were someone from the stable...{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk1028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You're the guy who saved us after that
mishap with the monster parts, right?
Whew... {{delay8}}Talk about a bad meal.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Say... {{delay8}}Being as you're such a helpful sort,
maybe you can help me out of the bind
I'm in now.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}There used to be six Cuccos here, see.
And I was hungry, and I figured where
there are Cuccos, there are eggs.
But when I got close...{{delay15}}all except one flew
away! Now it looks like I stole them!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Do you know what happens to Cucco
thieves around here? {{delay8}}Well, neither do I.
But probably nothing good!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I know what you're thinking. "How far
could they get with those little wings?
They must be {{color id="0"}}nearby{{color id="-1"}}!"{{delay8}}
And you'd be right about that. {{delay8}}But as
soon as I get close, they'll scram!

I really need to get the other {{color id="0"}}five {{color id="-1"}}Cuccos
{{color id="0"}}back inside the fence {{color id="-1"}}before someone
from the stable finds out...

---
label: 0001

I'll...leave you to it.

---
label: Talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_01"}}They can't have gone far, right?
But where are they?!

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* I guess that waiting for anything
that's flown the coop is useless.

---
label: Talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I can't seem to catch a single runaway
bird, let alone all {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}}!

If those missing {{color id="0"}}Cuccos {{color id="-1"}}aren't {{color id="0"}}inside the
fence {{color id="-1"}}soon, the folks at the stable are
gonna be decidedly not thrilled.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Where are they? They {{color id="0"}}can't have gone
too far{{color id="-1"}}, right?

---
label: Talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh? {{delay15}}Wha? {{delay8}}Looks like someone's been
helping with my missing {{color id="0"}}Cuccos{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you! But remember, they all need
to be {{color id="0"}}inside the fence {{color id="-1"}}or else they might
go running off again.

---
label: Talk1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Yup! That's where the Cuccos belong,
{{color id="0"}}inside the fence{{color id="-1"}}. Great work.

---
label: Talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh! How about that? {{delay15}}One of the missing
Cuccos is back in there already.

---
label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh? Wh-{{delay15}}what?! The missing Cuccos...

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Did you go searching for them?

---
label: Talk1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Your Cucco search is coming along
nicely, huh?

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I really appreciate it!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Unfortunately, {{color id="0"}}four {{color id="-1"}}are still missing.

---
label: Talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One, two...

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I really appreciate it!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Unfortunately, {{color id="0"}}three {{color id="-1"}}are still missing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One, two, three...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I really appreciate it!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Unfortunately, {{color id="0"}}two {{color id="-1"}}are still missing.

---
label: Talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}They must be near the stable, but where?


I have to get them back {{color id="0"}}inside the fence{{color id="-1"}},
and fast...

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Four!

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'm so, so grateful, but...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}There were five {{color id="0"}}Cuccos {{color id="-1"}}that ran away,
which means {{color id="0"}}one is still out there{{color id="-1"}}.
That one might be difficult to catch.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But it must be close to this stable.
It has to be!{{delay15}} Right?

---
label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I have to get those {{color id="0"}}Cuccos {{color id="-1"}}back {{color id="0"}}inside the
fence{{color id="-1"}}, or the folks at the stable will have
my hide...

---
label: Talk1040

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}There are still {{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}} to go...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}There are still {{color id="0"}}two {{color id="-1"}}to go...

---
label: Talk1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Four Cuccos down, one to go. This {{color id="0"}}last
one{{color id="-1"}}'s bound to be the smartest. How else
could it have evaded capture so long?

---
label: Talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh? The Cuccos are gone!

---
label: Talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Huh? There aren't as many Cuccos
as there were before!

---
label: Talk1034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Must've escaped when we weren't
looking...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One, {{delay8}}two, {{delay8}}three, {{delay8}}four, {{delay8}}five.{{delay15}}

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Five?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}{{size value="100"}}All five are here!{{delay8}}

label: Talk1024

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}You did it!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}It's almost embarrassing... After all your
help with the meat-and-rice-bowl incident,
you've saved my hide yet again.
{{size value="125"}}You're my hero!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}It's just... How do I put this? I really
don't want anyone to know the, ah,
you-know-whats went missing.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So... {{delay8}}Here.

---
label: Talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You might think of this as "hush money,"
and... {{delay15}}Yes. That's what it is.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But the operative word there is "money."
You like money, don't you? So take it!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Now, let's both pretend like this never
happened. Farewell!
