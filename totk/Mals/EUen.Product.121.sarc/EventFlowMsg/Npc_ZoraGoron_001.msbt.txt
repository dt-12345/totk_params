{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey. {{delay8}}Are you visitin' all the hot springs
around Eldin?{{delay8}} I hope not, 'cause it's not
a great time for that.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Some {{color id="0"}}strange rocks {{color id="-1"}}have shown up in
Goron City, and ever since, all of my
Goron buddies have been actin' weird.
I used to love the hot springs at the
grub place just up the road to the
{{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}.
The place is shaped like a rock roast!
Heh. Real nice place to relax, I tell ya.
Thing is...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I don't wanna get caught up in all of that,
so I'm tryin' to steer clear for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I used to love the hot springs at that
grub spot shaped like a rock roast.

Ya know, the one just up the road to the
{{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}...

But I haven't been since those {{color id="0"}}strange
rocks {{color id="-1"}}appeared and all of my Goron
buddies started actin' weird.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey. Are ya visitin' all the hot springs
around Eldin too?{{delay8}} Did ya try the waters
at {{color id="0"}}Bedrock Bistro{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: StartPoint_01_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Folks always go on an' on about the
famous steak they serve there, but that's
just the beginning.
We should all be goin' on and on about
the great hot springs in front of that
grub spot!
The place is shaped like a rock roast too.
Gets the ol' imagination runnin' wild!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You should see it for yourself. It's just up
the road to the {{color id="0"}}northeast {{color id="-1"}}from here.

label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Woooeee!{{delay15}} This water is perfect for a
nice, hot foot bath!

You should try relaxing in it yourself.{{delay8}}
It'll make your {{color id="0"}}fatigue melt away{{color id="-1"}}. That
means you'll feel real good after!
Eldin is full of great hot springs.{{delay8}}
You should try 'em all!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Wowie!{{delay15}} That's some great water.{{delay15}} Makes
your {{color id="0"}}fatigue just melt away{{color id="-1"}}. That means
you feel real good after!

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I hate the rain. It's so cold and dreary.{{delay8}}
When it stops, I'll drop by a hot spring
to warm up.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're a hot springs fan, too,
I gotta recommend a place called
{{color id="0"}}Lake Ferona Springs{{color id="-1"}}.
It's near{{color id="0"}} Foothill Stable{{color id="-1"}}, so you can
always stay there and take your time
healin' up in the spring.

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey. Where ya headed?{{delay8}} As for me,
I'm gonna heal up at the ol' hot spring
while stayin' at Foothill Stable!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Lots of hot springs are bubblin' up near
{{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Visitin' hot springs every day is good
for ya. That's what I say, anyway.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hear things are real bad in{{color id="0"}} Lanayru to
the east{{color id="-1"}}. They've got sticky black globs
fallin' down from the sky. Imagine that!
I think they're callin' it {{color id="0"}}sludge{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} Gross.
You'd better wash anything like that off in
a hot spring.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Oh, wait. {{delay8}}Guess there aren't any hot
springs in Lanayru, huh? {{delay8}}Wish I could
share some of Eldin's with 'em.

---
label: GoRange_02_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In Lanayru, off to the east, there are lots
of lakes and rivers and water-type stuff,
but not a single hot spring to be found.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That's one reason I love Eldin. So many
hot springs!

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey. If you're a traveler, it's a good idea
to have a couple of favorite hot springs to
rest up at.
There's a great one just up the road to
the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If ya hop in, you can{{color id="0"}} fully heal from the
fatigue of your journey{{color id="-1"}}. That means you'll
feel real good after!
So try stayin' at the nearby stable and
then heal up in that relaxin' hot spring.

---
label: GoRange_03_2

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}There's a hot spring up the road to the

That means you'll feel real good after!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Woooeee!{{delay15}} That hot spring {{delay15}}was
somethin' else, I tell ya.

Oh, hey. Are you lookin' for a hot spring?{{delay8}}
You should know there's a great one
further up the road to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}If ya hop in, you can{{color id="0"}} fully heal from the
