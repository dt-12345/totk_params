{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Look, Link...

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_001_b
---
There's a Gibdo hive... Just like the one
that appeared near Kara Kara Bazaar.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_002_b
---
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Both the hive and those tornadoes were
reported to have shown up at the same
time too.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_003_b
---
But it's not only the one hive... There are
three to deal with, each just outside the
town gates.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_003_b_00
---
I don't need a clairvoyant sand seal to
know a massive Gibdo attack is coming.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_005_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Right now those hives are durable and
nearly impervious to attack.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_006_b
---
But when they open and begin releasing
Gibdos, they're vulnerable.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_007_b
---
The Gibdos won't wait outside our
walls forever...

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_008_b
---
{{anim type="Determination_00"}}So when they launch their attack, that's
our chance to strike.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_009_b_00

{{playSound id="60" otherArg="0x0000"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?!

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_009_b
---
Come...

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_010_b
---
Come...

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_011_b
---
to where I am...

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_012_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Again... You heard it, didn't you?

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_013_b
---
"Come..." Is it calling out to us?

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_014_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Lady Riju? Link? Is something the matter?

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_015_b
---
I thought... It's nothing.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_016_b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Link. For now, we should focus on
protecting Gerudo Town from the
enemies at our gates.

---
label: Dm_GE_0009_Text_017_b
---
We must prepare for battle.
