{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Unbelievable!{{delay8}} It's such a long way here,{{delay8}}
but you're barely dressed for such
a journey!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You came all the way here...{{delay8}}dressed
like that?{{delay8}} Aren't you cold?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Look at you...{{delay8}} Dressed to keep nice and
warm, it seems.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The blizzard outside is furious, isn't it?{{delay8}}
This weather can be life-threatening to
those without {{color id="0"}}cold-resistant clothes{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}While my fashion is perfect for nearly
every scenario, sadly, a raging blizzard
isn't one of them. So I'm stuck here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You can buy cold-resistant clothing at
{{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} off to the west. Clothes that
are stuffed with feathers, I've heard.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But they say that the bridge that crosses
over to their village has collapsed. So
a journey there could prove fruitless.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}The blizzard outside keeps on churning.
It's surely life-threatening to those
without {{color id="0"}}cold-resistant clothes{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, it's you...{{delay8}} We meet again.{{delay8}} I'm still

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, it's you...{{delay8}} It looks you're prepared to
ward off the cold outside.
