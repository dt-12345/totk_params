{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Say, traveler... Excuse my interruption,
but you seem interested in that picture.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It is an unusual sight, isn't it?

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That is, in fact, a picture of the tracks of
the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}!

Rumors about that creature just keep
traveling from stable to stable, and from
person to person.
You might well find someone at any
stable spreading these rumors.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've even done a little searching around
the Eldin region. I was hoping I'd be the
one to discover what this beast is.
But I didn't find anything. It must not be
around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The idea of anything unknown—or that's
yet to be identified—makes me excited.
Like a new species!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Are you interested in that picture
after all?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It's apparently the footprint of that
{{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}.

It's really a Dondon...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What's that? You really saw this at
Lakeside Stable?!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Dondons, huh? I guess the rumors about
a beast were way off the mark, then.

Heh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little
sad. The rumors about the beast were a
lot to live up to.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}On the bright side, I now know just a bit
more about the world. Thanks for sharing
that info with me!

Goodbye.

you, traveler.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Interested in that picture, traveler? It's
actually the tracks of a new species called
Dondon, and...
Wait a minute...


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}It's you! I didn't even realize who I was
talking to.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've just been so excited about the
Dondon after hearing about it. I can't help
but bring it up with everyone.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I mean, I'm not just bringing it up out of
the blue or anything.

I only mention it to people who check
out the picture.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But... Well, you're the one who told me
about it in the first place, so I wouldn't be
telling you anything new, huh?
{{size value="80"}}So embarrassing.{{size value="100"}}

label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You saw one in person, didn't you? And
you're still interested in the tracks a
Dondon leaves? You must really be a fan!
I still can't believe it was around
Lakeside Stable...

I doubt I'll find any wandering around
here, no matter how hard I search...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's really wonderful to be able to learn
about the world just by hanging around in
a place like this.
Lucky Clover Gazette is a big part of that
too! Maybe someday I'll go visit them and
see what working there is like.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{delay8}}Hm. I wonder what is going on with
those people in their underpants
outside...
It's really strange, but I don't want to ask
what they're doing. That just seems like
it would be incredibly awkward.

---
label: Goodbye_03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Those people who were outside in their
underpants seem to have vanished.

Maybe it's finally time I try to visit the
Lucky Clover Gazette and see what
working there is like!
