Th-the village...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}They've destroyed the village. It's ruined!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}No way we're getting close with all those
{{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} around.

Hmm?{{delay15}} Why do I get the feeling we're
being watched?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah. Were you planning to visit
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}?

You might want to make other plans...
if you value your life.

Not to ruin your travel plans, but as head
of the village, it's my duty to protect
locals and visitors alike.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}You see over there? {{color id="0"}}Monsters {{color id="-1"}}have taken
over the village.

I don't know if they're after food or
supplies or what-have-you...

But the minute they arrived, they started
acting like they owned the place.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It might be difficult to see in the dark...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}By some bit of luck, everyone from the
village managed to escape in one piece.

But with their homes destroyed and
nowhere to live...well, the villagers
have scattered to the four winds.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If only those {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}weren't there.


Master builder that I am, I'd have those
buildings fixed up in a jiffy.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}There's certainly been an increase in
monsters lately. I wonder if it's because
of the Upheaval.
And they seem more aggressive too.
I never thought they'd be bold enough to
launch an attack from the sea.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}They're behaving just like {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}!


As long as even {{color id="0"}}a single one of them
remains{{color id="-1"}}, it's too dangerous to go
anywhere near the village.

---
label: Talk013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Our poor village... I never thought I'd see
the day it was overrun by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.

It seems like the monsters have gotten
more aggressive. Could it be because of
the Upheaval?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Aww!{{delay15}} They've gone and destroyed
another house! {{delay15}}There's simply no excuse
for treating a home so poorly.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Hmm? {{delay15}}Why do I get the feeling we're
being watched again?

---
label: Talk015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's you again... I take it you're still
worried about the fate of {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.

Even so, you should stay away if you
value your life.

label: Talk025

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's devastating to watch {{color id="0"}}pirates {{color id="-1"}}running
amok in my hometown.

Look what they've done. The entire village
is in ruins.

label: Talk036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It might be a bit difficult to see in

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}If broken houses were the only problem,
you can bet this master builder would
have everything fixed up, son and done!
But with pirates hanging about, well...
there's nothing I can do.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Worse yet, they show no sign of leaving!
What we need to do is {{color id="0"}}clear every one of
them out{{color id="-1"}} of the village.
We don't want them thinking they can
move in for good, do we?

---
label: Talk031

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I considered hitting them with a sneak
attack while they were sleeping...but it
seems like one of them is always awake!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh?!{{delay15}} I can't...{{delay15}}hear the monsters

of them!

label: Talk016

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I... {{delay8}}I saw everything from the house where
I was hiding!

This lone-warrior type showed up out of
nowhere and took out every monster in
the village all by himself!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}♪Whoa!{{delay8}} I knew it!♪


Sure, you look like a strong breeze could

STONE. {{delay15}}Knew it the moment I saw you!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}♪Whoa!♪{{delay8}} I can hardly believe it!{{pageBreak}}You look like a strong breeze could blow

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you!


We could do nothing but watch while
monsters overran our village. 

If you hadn't shown up, our home might
have been damaged beyond repair.

We owe you a great debt. Thank you,
thank you.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you!


I was so relieved that everyone in the
village escaped uninjured...

But still, it was awful...all we could do was
watch as the monsters overran our home.

If you hadn't come, this village might have
been ruined beyond repair.

We all owe you a great debt.{{delay8}} Thank you
so very much.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The good news is not all of the houses
have been destroyed. If we all work
together, I'm sure we can rebuild!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Don't you worry. I'll fix up all the houses
the monsters destroyed.

This kid's act of chivalry has lit a FIRE

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm sorry, but I don't have anything I can
give you as reward...not with our village

Of course, {{color id="0"}}once the village is rebuilt{{color id="-1"}}, we'll

Yes, I'm hopeful we can repay you for all
you've done...one day...eventually...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Now listen, everyone! Lurelin Village has
been given a chance at a fresh start.

If we all do our part, I know we can bring
this baby back from the brink.

So get ready, because ol' Bolson here is
gonna keep you busy until this village
is {{color id="0"}}rebuilt{{color id="-1"}}!
