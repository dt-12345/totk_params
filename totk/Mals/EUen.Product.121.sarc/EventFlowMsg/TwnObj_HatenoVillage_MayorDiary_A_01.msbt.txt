I firmly believe that Hateno Village's
charm is in the delicious vegetables
and milk from our farms.{{pageBreak}}But there's no denying that these
things just aren't resonating with the
youth nowadays.{{pageBreak}}And I've got no business being mayor if
I can't fix that.{{pageBreak}}So I got together with Nack, the best
farmer in these parts, and we came up
with a new type of pumpkin.{{pageBreak}}The color, shape, and appearance are
based on the Cece brand aesthetic,
which is popular with the young folk.{{pageBreak}}We've hit a snag though. It might be
a bit before we can achieve our goal of
shipping the pumpkins out.
