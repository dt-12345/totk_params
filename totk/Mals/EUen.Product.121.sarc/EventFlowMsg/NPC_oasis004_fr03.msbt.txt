I'm done using it, so have at it!

This blizzard, am I right?{{delay8}} I was making
{{color id="0"}}spicy food{{color id="-1"}} with {{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}} so I can
keep warm outside.

You know how we had that wild blizzard
going on?{{pageBreak}}I've been making {{color id="0"}}spicy food{{color id="-1"}} with {{color id="0"}}spicy
peppers {{color id="-1"}}so I can stay warm even if it
kicks back up again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}All you have to do is throw meat or
fish—or even mushrooms—into a pot
with {{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}} Simple, right?

Sounds delicious!

I have to try that!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Right? Riiight?{{pageBreak}}There are some {{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}} growing
by the well out back if you want to give
it a try!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It may be freezing outside, but eat some

you'll be feeling warm and toasty.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Eating {{color id="0"}}spicy food{{color id="-1"}} made with {{color id="0"}}spicy

You should give it a try! There are some
{{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}} growing near the well
out back.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But be careful. {{delay8}}Depending on what you
cook the peppers with, sometimes the
food won't come out spicy.
But that's the joy of cooking. It's fun to
try different combinations, even if they
don't always come out right.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You should try every ingredient you get
your hands on, and learn lots of recipes!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Lately I've been into mighty food—which
fills you with strength—and tough food,
which makes your body more durable.
This world's still pretty dangerous, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Not only are mighty and tough foods
delicious, they make it easier to fight
monsters. Two birds with one stone.
