{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Heya, kiddums! Made your way out of the
stable, have you? 

With temperatures this low, you've gotta
be prepared. Safety frost!

{{size value="125"}}{{delay15}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Achoo!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Pardon.{{delay15}} The cold snap might be over,
but it's still so chilly down here.

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Listen up, kiddums! Here's some free
advice! {{color id="0"}}Caves {{color id="-1"}}aside, this {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}is just
about the only place around to get warm.{{delay8}}
Be careful out there. Make whatever
preparations you have to.

Or if this isn't the chill you want to
die on, head east!

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure is cold out here! Head east if you
need to defrost.

If you feel like you're about to fall over,
you can take refuge in a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}.

label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}Underestimating the weather is a serious
snow pas!{{pageBreak}}You can stave off the cold by warming up
at a {{color id="0"}}fire {{color id="-1"}}or holing up in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}.

But cold isn't the only danger in these
parts—some of these {{color id="0"}}caves {{color id="-1"}}are stuffed
with monsters!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Keep a weather eye out for monsters if
you hole up in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}. A little care is a
small ice to pay!

---
label: GoRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hold on, kiddums! If you're heading {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}
to the {{color id="0"}}Hebra Mountains{{color id="-1"}}, you've got a
steep trek ahead.
Stock up at a {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} so
you're ice and prepared!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The road {{color id="0"}}north {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}Hebra Mountains{{color id="-1"}} is
awful steep—stock up at a {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}Rito
Village{{color id="-1"}} so you're ice and prepared!

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Visibility is a little toooo good around
here, so when you're outside, you're
the star of the snow.
Don't drop your guard out there—the
monsters sure won't!

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Visibility's so good out there, you'll be the
star of the snow. Keep your guard up!
After all...once bitten, ice shy!

label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sometimes, {{color id="0"}}deserted houses {{color id="-1"}}only LOOK
deserted—and then you find {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}
chilling inside.
Keep your head up, kiddums!

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You might think you've found a {{color id="0"}}deserted
house{{color id="-1"}}, and then find a bunch of {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}
inside. Stay frosty!

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you ever tried rolling a {{color id="0"}}snowball {{color id="-1"}}into
a monster?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Fighting monsters isn't usually what puts
a smile on my face, but if you go with the
snow, you can really have a ball!

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Making a big ol' {{color id="0"}}snowball {{color id="-1"}}and rolling it
into monsters can be tough. Remember—
just go with the snow!

Snow and steady.

I call it as icy 'em...

It can't snow forever...

It's been raining too long...

To the Hebra Mountains...

Nothing to see here...

Monsters? Snow way...

label: Near_BackRange_02

A snowball should do it...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wow, kiddums!{{delay8}} I owe you one!

---
label: SavedLv1_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wow, thanks for saving me! This area's
sure lousy with monsters these days.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}Phew, I thought that was it for me!{{delay8}}
I'm glad you came, kiddums.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Fighting's just not for me. Imagine if we
were at peace... What an ice dream, eh?

---
label: SavedLv3_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah! That was close! I was on thin ice for
a minute there.

---
label: SavedLv3_01

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I thought I had a snowball's chance in
summer of making it out alive! Thanks for
your help, kiddums!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Good timing! Now give 'em the
cold one-two!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}What in the tundra?! Not even a big ol'
snowball has a chance against that!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'm mighty grateful you came through
for me. {{delay8}}In fact, here's a small token of
my thanks.
Take it! You're too young to be
modest, kiddums.
