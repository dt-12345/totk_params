{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Well, if it isn't the customer who brought
all those eggs!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We can barely keep them on the shelves.


They've been especially popular with the
Zonai Survey Team investigating the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
Anyway... What can I do for you?

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I have the oddest feeling whenever
we chat...

It's almost like I've known you for ages.
It makes me want to chatter away.

Next time we talk, you should just tell me
what you want. Maybe that'll stop me
from talking your ear off.

---
label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So what can I help you with?

---
label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Let's see... Of course I recommend the
{{color id="0"}}swift carrots{{color id="-1"}} my mister grows. There's
nothing better!
But Olkin's {{color id="0"}}fortified pumpkins{{color id="-1"}} are also a
good choice. We didn't use to stock them,
you know...
Old Olkin and my mister quarreled for
years and years.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}But now they get on, and we have those
pumpkins. It's a miracle!

label: Talk1006

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Stop by anytime.

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks!{{pageBreak}}Hey, while you're here, maybe you
should take a look around and see
if there's anything else you want.

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}All of our produce is freshly picked,
straight from the field to you.
So you KNOW it's gonna be tasty.

---
label: Talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Right now is when everything is at
its freshest. Better get it while the
gettin's good!

---
label: Talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks much. My mister'll be happy
about this too.

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}I can't believe it... {{delay15}}I've got no more of
those?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Well, glad to make a sale.{{delay8}} I'm very
grateful.

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I don't get away from this place
too often...{{pageBreak}}So I appreciate your showing me such
interesting things.

Recommendations?

---
label: 0003
---
I want to sell!

Bye.

Welcome!

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}What are you selling?

---
label: Com_Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I can offer {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} for that.
Is that OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_02
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}To think I'd luck into something as neat
as this... My mister will be pleased too.

---
label: Com_Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}There's no hurry. Please take your time.

---
label: Com_Talk_05
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Travelers have been bringing in the most
interesting items. I can't wait to show
everything to my mister.

---
label: Com_Talk_13
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}And how many?

---
label: Com_Talk_14
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}All right, {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}... That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
Sound OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That looks important... I couldn't possibly
accept that.

---
label: Com_Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}You have to remove it before I can take it.
Go on—I won't peek.

---
label: Com_Talk_31
---
{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}{{color id="-1"}}Well then, how many do you want?

---
label: Com_Talk_33
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Just one? That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
Sound OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_34
---
Well now, all of them will cost you
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} Is that OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_35
---
All {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them, eh? I'd say that adds up
to {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. Is that OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_50
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}So... That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. Does
that sound OK?

---
label: Com_Talk_52
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}For {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}... I'd say {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
How's that?

---
label: Com_Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}There's no hurry.

---
label: Com_Talk_54
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="-1"}}Oops! You don't have enough.

---
label: Com_Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oops... Looks like your pouch is full.
Come back when you've made room.

Of course, if there's anything you don't
need, I'm happy to buy.

---
label: Com_Talk_56
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}For one,{{delay8}} that'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_Talk_02b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm really grateful you'd sell me something
of this quality! I can barely believe it.

---
label: Com_Talk_02c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I enjoy trading with all sorts of travelers.

---
label: Com_Talk_02d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}If you're looking for something you can't
find here in Kakariko Village, you probably
didn't need it anyway.

---
label: Com_Talk_05b
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}I do enjoy a good chat! Can I help with
anything else?

---
label: Com_Talk_05c
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Still have something you want to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_05d
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Deciding what to sell can be fun, so you
just take your time.

---
label: 5500
---
OK.

---
label: 5501
---
Never mind.

---
label: 5502
---
I'll buy!

---
label: 5503
---
Never mind.

---
label: 5507
---
I'll take 'em all!

---
label: 5508
---
All of them.
