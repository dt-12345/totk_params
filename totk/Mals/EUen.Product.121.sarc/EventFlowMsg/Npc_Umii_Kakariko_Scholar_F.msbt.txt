{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Traveler? {{delay8}}Are you feeling OK?


Folks are calling this stuff {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}If you
care about your health, it's best not to
go near it.
If you get any on you, you'll start {{color id="0"}}losing

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I touched some gloom while poking

You'll {{color id="0"}}recover{{color id="-1"}} from the worst of it on your
own, little by little, so long as you're on
the {{color id="0"}}surface{{color id="-1"}}.
But while you're in the Depths, you won't
recover at all.{{delay8}} I thought I was going to die

*sigh* {{delay8}}Some investigation leader I turned
out to be. {{delay8}}This is just pitiful.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Traveler, please be extra cautious around
the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.

I've been recovering slowly—very slowly—
since coming back to the surface.

But while I was in the Depths, I couldn't
recover at all.{{delay8}} Who knows what would've
become of me...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm taking care of myself and resting, but{{delay8}}
I can't imagine an encounter with the
gloom a second time, no sir.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}There's no way I can make Daval work
alone in the rain.

I need to recover. Pronto.
