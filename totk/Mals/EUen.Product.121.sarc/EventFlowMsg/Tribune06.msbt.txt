{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Careful there, partner. You went and
scared all the little birds away!

You go storming around like that and it
won't just be birds you send flying for
the hills!
It's fine though. I did hear some
interesting chirps and warbles from them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I don't want to say this too loud and start
a panic, but...

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Rumors are spreading about {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}—that
she's been seen riding some mysterious beast.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}{{size value="100"}}It's said to be a mountain of a beast
too—one with huge, brutal tusks.

My little reporters had never seen
something so frightening!

Of course, what made it far worse was
that it seemed...{{delay8}}like the princess herself
was controlling this terrifying creature.

label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I find it hard to believe a beast like that
could really be lurking in Hyrule.

But if this terrifying monster exists, then
the implications...{{delay8}}make this a very, very
huge story.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You know, there were guests {{color id="0"}}at this
stable {{color id="-1"}}talking about some kind of
{{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}My little bird informants told me that
there have been a number of sightings in
the {{color id="0"}}subtropical region in the south{{color id="-1"}}.
If we want to learn more, we should dive
beak-first into this stable and others to
see if there's any truth to these rumors.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}We just need to peck away at this until we
figure out if it's an enticing truth or an
elaborate fiction...

label: Talk1030

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Hold on! You're saying you've {{color id="0"}}seen the
beast {{color id="-1"}}that Princess Zelda was rumored to
be riding on?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Huh. A new species called a Dondon. I'd
suspected it would be some animal that
no one had ever seen before...
There's still something missing though.
It'd be a crime to put out the story in
this state.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Could {{color id="0"}}I talk to that caretaker{{color id="-1"}} you heard
the story from? I want to see this with my
own eyes.
It's never a bad idea to get a second
opinion on things. That's why editors
exist!{{delay8}} Anyway, let's {{color id="0"}}meet at the site{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}A {{color id="0"}}beast{{color id="-1"}} that's rumored to be a mountain

We might have a real situation here if...{{delay8}}
the princess really is controlling it.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Well, for now we need to gather
more information.

There was a visitor here talking about
sightings of the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}} in a
{{color id="0"}}subtropical region to the south{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Hopefully you can pluck out some more

---
label: Talk1022

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I caught sight of you while I was looking
into things at the stable here.

---
label: Talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I've heard there are rare animals around
here somewhere. How about you help me
dig into the story here, partner?

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?!{{delay15}} Hold on. You're saying this all
relates to that beast people have seen
Princess Zelda riding around on?

---
label: Talk1050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}So...{{delay8}}it wasn't a beast at all, just a {{color id="0"}}newly
discovered animal{{color id="-1"}} called a Dondon.

And it was Princess Zelda herself
conducting research on them!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Wow, rumors can really get out of hand,
can't they?

I mean, it's hardly a mountain of a beast.
Not even a small hill. All that talk of brutal
tusks was overblown too.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's why a good reporter must confirm
the details before they go to print!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You did a good job, partner.

---
label: Talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Ah, I see, I see. So it was one of the rare
animals here that Princess Zelda was
seen riding.
And, in fact, the princess was also
researching these creatures!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Wow, rumors really can get out of hand,
can't they?

I mean, it's hardly a mountain of a beast,

plain wrong. Such gentle creatures!
