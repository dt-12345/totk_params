{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}Is that... It is! Hey, bud!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I had heard you were missing, but here
you are, looking perfectly healthy to me!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Teba{{color id="-1"}} was worried about you, you know.
Have you been to see him yet?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm tempted to go tell him the good news,
but I'm all tied up at the moment.{{color id="0"}}{{pageBreak}}Teba{{color id="-1"}} should be in {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}, which is
just {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} of here. I'm sure he'd be happy
to get a visit from you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Have you been to see {{color id="0"}}Teba{{color id="-1"}} yet?{{pageBreak}}He's in {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}, which is just {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Teba is protecting the village, where the
children are, so that I can keep things
going here.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Whether it's figuring out the source of
this weird weather or scrounging food day
and night, everyone's pitching in.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But don't feel like you're intruding, bud!
If there's anything you want to know,
you can ask me.

---
label: Npc_Talk002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'll tell you as much as I know. Ask away.

label: Npc_Talk003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Any other questions for me?

label: Npc_Talk004

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If there's anything you want to ask me,
shoot. I'll answer if I can.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anything else you want to know?

it again.

Where's Tulin?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Other than making sure everyone is fed?
Mostly we investigate what the deal is
with this blizzard.{{pageBreak}}This island-looking thing appeared in the
sky along with the blizzard. It's been
raining down junk on us ever since.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Not only that, we have to deal with these
packs of flying monsters. I've never seen
anything like them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Most of us are focused on checking out
the mountains themselves, but some are
looking into Rito legends and fables.{{pageBreak}}We're casting a wide net with this one.
Anything that might be related is
fair game.{{pageBreak}}You never know where the clue that
breaks the whole thing wide open will
be found, after all.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I wouldn't rule anything out as long as
there's a chance.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Right now, Tulin is with Gesane and
Laissa looking for food at the {{color id="0"}}Hebra
South Summit cave{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The blizzard hasn't hit the caves as hard,
so you can still find fish and mushrooms
inside them sometimes.

label: Npc_Talk012

The cave they were headed out to is
{{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}, up the mountain road past
the cliff out front.

---
label: Npc_Talk013
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}bonfire{{color id="-1"}} burning at the {{color id="0"}}cave's
entrance {{color id="-1"}}if you need a landmark to find it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}We're nearly certain that the source of
this blizzard is above that cloud. If we can
confirm that, it's a good first step.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We don't yet have the supplies to make
the trek up there, but we're chipping
away at the problem, little by little.{{pageBreak}}Just between you and me, we're thinking
of sending Tulin as our investigator.
You should see him in action.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}His abilities really are something, Link.
He's a better flier and archer than most
of the adults.{{pageBreak}}And the way he can {{color id="0"}}create winds at will{{color id="-1"}}?
That's a trick I've never even heard of
anyone else pulling off.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The only thing is...with all that skill at his
command, he tends to assume he doesn't
need anyone else backing him up.{{pageBreak}}And that's gotten him into trouble more
times than I can count.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Teba and I talk all the time about what he
could accomplish if he could only get rid
of that silly idea.

label: Npc_Talk011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you intend to follow Tulin in this kind
of weather, be prepared before you
head out.

What incredible teamwork!

label: Talk0022

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'm sure the two of you can overcome
anything if you work together. Don't worry
about Teba. You two should get going!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Bring me back a nice souvenir, OK, bud?

---
label: Talk0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Between the two of you, I bet you could
do anything. And if Teba were here, he'd
say the same.

Lookout Landing, hm?

---
label: Talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'm thinking about heading over to
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing {{color id="-1"}}as a representative
of the Rito.{{pageBreak}}If Hyrule's not at peace, the Rito aren't
at peace either, right?{{pageBreak}}I just need to get a couple things
together, and I'll be ready to set out.

---
label: Talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I plan to set out for {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}} as
soon as I'm ready. There must be some
way we Rito can help.
