{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, sir! Pardon my query, but are you
familiar with {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}?

The region is famed for its enormous
volcano, {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}. The mountain
can guide you {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}, straight to {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}}
The lava once made it unbearably hot, but
I hear it's more comfortable these days.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The caves are still scorching, mind!{{delay8}}
Take care to prepare {{color id="0"}}elixirs {{color id="-1"}}if you ever
need to enter.
Say, if you're going to {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}, how about
you purchase ingredients for those
elixirs now?{{delay15}}
I have a modest collection here...

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You'll reach {{color id="0"}}Eldin {{color id="-1"}}if you head {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}.
I hear the caves are so scorching that
you'll crisp up without an {{color id="0"}}elixir{{color id="-1"}}!
If you're heading that way, are you
interested in purchasing ingredients?
I have a modest collection here...

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hello and welcome. {{delay15}}Just as I predicted,
a customer has arrived!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I am a merchant, you know.{{delay8}} It's not like
I'm here for no reason.{{delay8}}

{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}is bubbling due to the
discovery of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. A number of
folks pass through, not only researchers.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}This is the very best location to tempt
passersby who are in the market for
quality goods.{{delay8}} So...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A lot of folks are heading to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village {{color id="-1"}}to see the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

I thought I'd take advantage of the
crowds by setting up shop in front of
this gate!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Anyway, you didn't come to hear about
my business plan. You're looking to trade!
Tell me, what do you want to do?

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hello, sir...{{delay8}} Do you have a moment to
listen to my woes?

The problem...{{delay15}} The problem is...{{pageBreak}}I haven't been selling anything. {{delay15}}At all.


I thought I'd curated the perfect offerings
to suit the region's climate. {{delay15}}I even threw
in a few unusual specialty goods.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ah, well, it's a new day!{{delay15}} And I have
a feeling you're about to make a
large purchase.
Um, right?

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Things may not be going my way, but I
won't let that hold me back! {{delay15}}So!

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello there! {{delay15}}You look like someone who
enjoys purchasing items.

Did you know some merchants don't work
on rainy days? {{delay15}}I call them amateurs!

Real pros don't mind a little falling water.
You simply go out there, stay dry, and try
not to give in to despair.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Eventually, a customer will appear...{{delay15}}like
you did!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Rain or shine, the machines of commerce
must keep humming along! {{delay15}}So!

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Pardon, sir! Are you familiar with
{{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}?

You'll reach the home of the {{color id="0"}}Zora{{color id="-1"}} if you
head {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}!

Everyone knows it has a fine reputation
for healthy fish, but I hear more sludge
than rain has been falling recently.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Apparently the water is no longer clean,
and fishing has grown more difficult.

I sell fewer fish now, but I have developed
a keener eye for quality. Take a look!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}{{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain {{color id="-1"}}is to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}, but I hear
it's been struggling with a deluge
of {{color id="0"}}sludge{{color id="-1"}}.
That means I have fewer fish in stock,
but I don't compromise on quality.
Please, take a look.

---
label: GoRange_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there, sir! Are you familiar with
{{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}?

You'll find the {{color id="0"}}Zora{{color id="-1"}}'s home {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} of here.
Blessedly, the sludge has disappeared,
and they can catch tasty fish again.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}And do tasty fish interest you, sir?{{delay15}}
Well, you're in luck! I have some in stock.{{delay8}}
Take a look...

---
label: GoRange_04_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Have you heard? {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}, long at
the mercy of that wretched sludge, has
returned to its tranquil self.
And even better, that means the Zora's 
tasty fish are back in stock! And so...

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there, sir! Say, have you ever
visited {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}? Or perhaps you're familiar
with its largest settlement, Rito Village?
Hebra's an incredibly cold region in the
mountains to the northwest. It's so
chilly that {{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}} are a must.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}One can shrug off even the most ruthless
cold by eating a dish prepared with a
{{color id="0"}}spicy pepper{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}} Now, to business...

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Head far to the {{color id="0"}}northwest {{color id="-1"}}and you'll
arrive at {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}, which is best known
for {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
It's dreadfully cold, so make sure your
bag is packed with {{color id="0"}}spicy peppers{{color id="-1"}} when
you go. Now, to business...

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you continue down the road to the
{{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}, you'll reach {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

The village has been bustling ever since
the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}were discovered there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Crowds of people means lots of business.
So I will go, of course.{{delay15}} Now, let us do
some business of our own...

---
label: GoRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I hear that{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} are bringing
lots of folks{{color id="0"}} southeast {{color id="-1"}}to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}

As a merchant, I couldn't possibly miss
a business opportunity like that. Why,
merely thinking about it is thrilling...
Ahem. Shall we get to business?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there, sir! Say, are you familiar with
{{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}?{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

It's found just past the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru Wetlands{{color id="-1"}}
to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I used to source fresh fish from the Zora,
but then sludge started falling from the
sky and polluting the water.
Now they don't catch many fish anymore.{{delay15}}
Wretched, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But enough of that. To happier matters.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're looking for {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}}, it's

something, well, I'm right here.
*sigh* The {{color id="0"}}sludge{{color id="-1"}} falling from the sky has
been quite the trial for the poor Zora.

If you must head that direction, perhaps
my wares can help you prepare.

---
label: BackRange_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there, sir! Good news—the sludge
plaguing {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain {{color id="-1"}}has disappeared!

I've been able to procure fresh fish from
the Zora for the first time in ages.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Just look at my selection of fine seafood!
Doesn't get any better than this, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But have you ever traveled to the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo{{color id="-1"}}

The desert is a merciless place—the days
are scorching hot, and the nights are
wretchedly cold.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}But here's a trick to make it bearable...{{delay15}}
{{color id="0"}}Chuchu jelly{{color id="-1"}}! Even the name is charming.

When it's hot, break it open and soak in
the water. {{delay8}}When it's cold, the jelly is as
good as coals.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}What a miraculous substance! There's no
excuse not to carry it. And if a merchant
happened to have it on hand...{{delay8}}well!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're heading {{color id="0"}}southwest{{color id="-1"}} to the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there! Have you been to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
