{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, hello, Link. I should have known we
would run into you here.{{pageBreak}}We came to investigate the geoglyph in
this region, but the sludge falling from
the sky complicated things.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Fortunately, that muck is gone now, and
our efforts to research the local geoglyph
may resume.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The ancient literature states that the
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}} is at the bottom of
a canyon in Hebra.
We believe that it will be integral to our
understanding of the geoglyphs.

Investigating the local geoglyph is still
important, but I would like to find that
temple as soon as possible.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}There have been reports of a geoglyph in
this area. We plan on taking to the skies
to look for it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The ancient literature says that the
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}} holds information that
could aid us in finding the geoglyphs.
I propose we start there. We can find the
temple in a canyon in Hebra.
