What is it meant to depict?

---
label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}What a surprise it is to see you here
after all this time, Link.

---
label: Talk_69
---
Yes, {{delay8}}you tried to frighten me with that
uniform, but I still recognize you.

---
label: Talk_71
---
Yes, {{delay8}}I still recognize you, even with that
outfit on.

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I heard you had gone missing. It is
certainly a relief to see you back, and
in one piece—more or less.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}And Princess Zelda! {{delay15}}Where is she?

---
label: Talk_68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I heard you had gone missing. I am
relieved to see you made it back—even
if your clothes evidently did not.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}And Princess Zelda! {{delay15}}Where is she?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}What? {{delay8}}She still has yet to return?{{delay15}}
In that case, we must use all available
means to search for her.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Link,{{delay8}} when Princess Zelda went missing,
something else happened all over Hyrule.{{delay15}}

During the Upheaval, huge pictures
appeared out of nowhere, images that
sprawled across fields and hills.
{{anim type="Think_01"}}We are calling them {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}.
I understand they have been found in
locations across the kingdom.
Cado and I are traveling from region to
region in hopes of seeing them all.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I noticed this geoglyph from a distance
while I was standing on high ground.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Examining it up close, I could not make
out what it depicted.

I thought I might have a better view from
up in the sky.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I took to the air in the {{color id="0"}}balloon {{color id="-1"}}Purah
gave me, but then, alas...

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}The wind struck and completely sheared
the balloon off the base.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I have racked my brain for ways to
reattach the two parts, to no avail.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}The wind struck and tore the
balloon apart.

I wonder if there is some way to reattach
it to its base.

---
label: 0008
---
Sure!

---
label: 0009
---
Not right now.

---
label: Talk_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right. Let me know when you're ready.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{anim type="Think"}}That geoglyph... {{delay15}}Surely I could see it more
clearly from up in the sky.

---
label: 0010
---
Up in the sky?

---
label: 0001
---
About this geoglyph...

---
label: 0002
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Hm. This is frustrating.

---
label: Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mm-hmm. It is so large, I cannot clearly
see the design from down here.

I would be better able to make it out from
a high vantage point.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That was why I went up in the {{color id="0"}}balloon{{color id="-1"}}
Purah gave me. Alas...

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is one of the giant pictures that
have appeared on the surface of Hyrule.{{delay8}}
I am traveling the land to see them all.

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What are you doing? Please, try not to
damage my balloon.

---
label: near_04
---
Where are you taking that?

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? This is no time to fool around. Put
my balloon back where you found it.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh! You fixed my balloon?
Thank you, Link!

Will you come with me to look at the
geoglyph, then?

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ready to go see the geoglyph?

---
label: Talk_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Time to head out, then.{{pageBreak}}Ah...I nearly forgot. Would you mind
doing one final thing for me?

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Light a fire there and the balloon will start
to float. Then we can be on our way.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}On second thought...{{delay8}}I don't see any way
to get on.

Link...{{delay15}} Would you clear some space on the
balloon so I can board?

---
label: Talk_60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}On second thought, I am not sure
we should ride it yet.

For this to work, we will need the balloon
to float {{color id="0"}}directly upward{{color id="-1"}}. Will you please
make sure it can do that?

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay8}}Where are we going?{{delay8}} Link, this is
the wrong way!

---
label: Talk_52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Hmm... I panicked and got off, and now
the balloon is broken again.

---
label: near_02
---
Yes, good! Higher!

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm? What is it?

---
label: 0003
---
Where are we heading?

---
label: 0004
---
Let's pull back.

---
label: 0005
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Please, try to take the balloon {{color id="0"}}directly
above {{color id="-1"}}the geoglyph.

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oh! So you want to go back?

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I know I can count on you.

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Oh! What happened?


Has something gone wrong? Maybe we 
should head back to solid ground...

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm.{{delay8}} Starting over...{{pageBreak}}All I need is a clear view of the geoglyph.
Try to move us straight upward, without
going in other directions.

---
label: 0006
---
We should head back.

---
label: 0007
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What is going on?! I feel faint...

---
label: Talk_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey! Come back! You forgot me!

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Phew... That was quite the crash landing.
Thank goodness you are all right.

Sadly, the balloon did not fare so well.

---
label: Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Link? {{delay8}}Link! Where did you disappear to?

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Phew! Good thing we got the balloon
down after your little stunt.

But it hit the ground too hard, and now it
is damaged.{{delay8}} Again.

---
label: Talk_57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Ah!{{delay8}} I'm falling!{{delay8}} Heeelp!

---
label: Talk_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}That was close... Somehow I managed not
to get hurt.

---
label: Talk_59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What a {{color id="0"}}Dragon's Tear{{color id="-1"}} is, I can only guess.
But it seems such a thing can be found on
the geoglyph.
Would you try looking around? This could
be the clue we need to discover Princess
Zelda's whereabouts.

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, that was dangerous. Shall we try it
again from the start?

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Too high up... {{delay8}}I feel faint...

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}But finally we can see it. The geoglyph!
Well done, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You know, I read something in the
village's old literature—{{delay8}}a passage about
what the ancients called {{color id="0"}}Dragon's Tears{{color id="-1"}}.
"Where the Tears rest upon the earth,{{delay8}}
we marked down the images {{delay8}}to which
they gave birth."

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I believe this geoglyph is one such
"image." But even from this vantage,
its meaning is no clearer to me.
Nor can I figure out what "{{color id="0"}}Dragon's
Tears{{color id="-1"}}" might be.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But you know...{{delay8}}if the literature is correct,
one of them should be quite close—{{delay8}}near
the geoglyph, or even within its borders.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Would you look around? This could be the
clue we need to discover Princess Zelda's
whereabouts.

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you would like to examine the geoglyph
from ground level, you can float down
with a paraglider.
No need to worry about me. I can manage
a simple landing.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}If you want to get down, use a paraglider
to float to the ground.

No need to worry about me. I can manage

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Is there some place you want to be? {{delay8}}
If so, you can hop off from the balloon
and use a paraglider to go toward it.
No need to worry about leaving me
behind. I can manage a simple landing.

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you would like to see the geoglyph
again, you can use the balloon once more.

No need to bring me along. Your steering
makes me feel a bit faint.

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Are you going to take me to a spot above
the geoglyph this time?

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I thank you, Link! Now, let's hop aboard.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Goodness! {{delay15}}You say you had a vision?
Saw mysterious figures?

---
label: Talk_61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}And then Princess Zelda?! {{delay15}}Hmm...


The geoglyphs, the literature, the
Dragon's Tears...and now, a vision of
the lost princess.

---
label: Talk_62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}What if these are all connected?

---
label: Talk_63
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Let us continue to examine the geoglyphs.
They may contain further clues that lead
to Princess Zelda.
You know, according to the literature,
there is something to do with geoglyphs
in the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.
The {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple {{color id="-1"}}lies at the bottom
of a canyon in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}. I think we should
make our way there soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}What if these are all connected?

---
label: Talk_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Let us continue to examine the geoglyphs.
They may contain further clues that lead
to Princess Zelda.
I am also curious about whatever it
was the Light Dragon dropped. {{delay15}}Worth
investigating, I think.

---
label: Talk_67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}I see... So the Dragon's Tears were shed
by Princess Zelda when she transformed.{{delay15}}

And the geoglyphs were drawn by an
ancient people who touched those
memories and saw visions, as you did.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Perhaps in the past they were more
attuned to that sort of thing than the
people of today.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hm... I understand now.{{delay15}} So that is the
truth of it all.

Link. {{delay15}}If all of the memories you saw are
true, then that means...

Since our Princess Zelda has become the
Light Dragon, she can never again return
to her original form.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}It is...painfully tragic.{{delay15}} Our dear
Princess Zelda...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}No. It cannot be!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Link... Would you excuse me? I need to
be alone for a while.

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}...{{delay15}}First. A word of advice.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}According to the literature, there is
something to do with the geoglyphs
in the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.
{{anim type="Think_01"}}I suggest you go there and learn what
you can. The temple lies at the bottom
of a {{color id="0"}}canyon in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, yes... The literature says there is
something to do with the geoglyphs
in the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.
The temple lies at the bottom of a {{color id="0"}}canyon
in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}. Cado and I may go there
ourselves as well.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm. The geoglyph is difficult to make
out from here.

Maybe if I could look down on it from
a higher position...

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm. I will try and work out a solution.
Please let me know if any ideas come to
you as well.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Light Dragon... {{delay8}}But what was it
doing here?

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, I heard you had gone missing.
It is certainly a relief to see you back and
in one piece—{{delay8}}more or less.
But wait. Where is Princess Zelda?

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, I heard you had gone missing.
I am relieved to see you made it back—{{delay8}}
even if your clothes evidently did not.
And Princess Zelda! Where is she?
