Link... Zelda's chosen protector...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0015_Text_023_b

My name is Mineru. I am the
Sage of Spirit.

label: Dm_ZN_0015_Text_024_b
---
I am happy you have arrived. At last we
can speak with each other.

Unfortunately, I no longer have a body...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0015_Text_026_b
---
Without a physical form, we cannot yet
speak face-to-face.

label: Dm_ZN_0015_Text_027_b
---
But...do you see the four storehouses
in the area?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0015_Text_028_b
---
I would ask you to visit each of them and
assemble a body for me.

This is my request to you, Link, loyal
swordsman to Zelda.
