{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}You're Yiga Clan, huh? {{delay15}}All right. {{delay15}}Come in.

---
label: Door_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}I have nothing to say to those not of the Yiga.{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_Iga_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hmm. I feel like I know you from
somewhere, but I'm drawing a blank.{{pageBreak}}But who you are is not important.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Though members of the Yiga Clan should
take care to keep themselves presentable.

label: Talk_Iga_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}This is the Yiga Blademaster Station.


It is where Yiga blademasters are made
and unmade.

You braved the elements to take this first
step. That speaks well of your passion to
become a blademaster.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}But my exam is more rigorous still. {{delay15}}Do you
have it within you to succeed? Will you try
and give it your all?

---
label: 0000
---
I'll do it!

---
label: 0001
---
No, thanks.

---
label: Talk_Iga_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, wonderful! Well, then...


Listen closely to my words. The test is
unforgiving. This is what you must do.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}In Gerudo Canyon, there are five {{color id="0"}}frog
statues{{color id="-1"}} with the identifying marks of the
Yiga Clan.
I will reveal the locations. 

---
label: Talk_Iga_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}What you must do is travel to the five
frogs and make an offering of {{color id="0"}}mighty
bananas{{color id="-1"}} to each one.

---
label: Talk_Iga_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}This harsh land will lash you mercilessly
with its cold and heat. Your travels may
prove your end. But if you succeed...
I will name you a blademaster.


Furthermore, I will personally give you
these mighty bananas.

---
label: Talk_Iga_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}I have no more bananas to give for now.{{delay15}}
If you need more, a true blademaster is
expected to find their own.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Now! {{delay15}}Let the test begin!

---
label: Talk_Iga_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hm. I see that you are well-supplied with
mighty bananas already. Good. It is wise
to be so readily prepared for anything.{{pageBreak}}Your reward instead will be some rupees.

---
label: Talk_Iga_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}All blademasters should be so thoroughly
prepared for battle. I expect great things
from you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And with that...{{delay15}}let the exam begin!

---
label: Talk_Iga_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Finally, you have returned after making
the necessary offerings. {{delay15}}My intelligence
sources have confirmed it.
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}You pass the blademaster exam!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I have a reward for your assuming the
mantle of blademaster. You are permitted
to step into the inner sanctum.
This reward is valuable and only found
in the Depths. You should know that it
is a great honor to receive one.{{pageBreak}}Pay no heed to the strange glowing ruins
you may find inside. {{delay15}}We haven't yet
decided what to do about them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}What's important is your hard work in
overcoming the blademaster exam.
All glory to Master Kohga!

---
label: Talk_Iga_05
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Wait!{{size value="100"}}


No one is allowed in there until they have
passed the blademaster exam.

---
label: Talk_Iga_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Yiga Clan is expanding. We can
always use a few more outstanding
blademasters.
See the exam through and you could be
of great service to Master Kohga.

---
label: Talk_Iga_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The blademaster exam can be challenging.
As someone who knows it inside and out,
I have one piece of advice.
If you cannot find a frog statue,
challenge yourself...to think things
through from a different angle.
A blademaster must be able to take a
broad view of a problem.

---
label: Talk_Iga_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Tell yourself to stay calm when you need
to focus. {{delay15}}That focus will help you make
haste as you complete the offerings.
A blademaster must be able to call upon
calm and haste as needed.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_Iga_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}I see. If your wish is to contribute to the
Yiga Clan cause from the front lines, I can
respect that.
However...if you want to make a more
significant contribution, then return here
and attempt the blademaster exam.

---
label: Talk_Iga_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's a very honorable thing to serve
Master Kohga as a blademaster.{{pageBreak}}The exam is rigorous, but will you make
the attempt for his sake anyway?

---
label: Balloon_Iga_00
---
Is there no one capable?

---
label: Balloon_Iga_01
---
Stay calm. Make haste.

---
label: Balloon_Iga_02
---
Excellent...

---
label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I really want to go back, but I'm worried
about traveling...

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, I'm sorry. {{delay8}}I was so lost in thought that
I didn't notice you.

Originally, I came here to share my prized
recipes with people.

With that done, I was going to head home.
But I've heard some scary rumors.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Apparently, the Yiga Clan has been
spotted behind a waterfall along the
road in Gerudo Canyon.
They've got to be up to no good in there.{{delay15}}
*sigh* How can I head back with that
weighing on my mind?{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What could the Yiga Clan be doing there?
Nothing good, that's for sure.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Be careful if you're going to pass through
Gerudo Canyon, OK?

Especially around that new waterfall along
the road with the suspicious entrance
behind it.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I was able to share my recipes, and I'm
ready to head back, but I'm worried
about the Yiga Clan sightings.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}You should be careful if you pass through
Gerudo Canyon.

Especially around the new waterfall along
the road. {{delay15}}I saw a suspicious-looking
entrance there.
It makes you wonder what in the world
they're up to...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{anim type="Sleep"}}Zzz... Zzz...

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh my! To think that you'd want to chat
this early in the day. I'm flattered.

Let's talk later. I'm a little busy now,
all right?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let's put this off until a little later.
There's somewhere I need to be.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's gotten quite late. Could we chat
tomorrow? I'm exhausted, but rest will
restore my sociability.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I was able to share my recipes, and I'm
ready to head back, but...

Well, I'm worried about the Yiga Clan
in Gerudo Canyon.

What could they be up to?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wow! {{delay8}}You took a blademaster exam...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's a really scary story, but I suppose
that's not very common when someone is
just traveling normally.
As long as I'm careful, it sounds like
I should be OK getting back.

Thanks for telling me what happened.

---
label: Balloon_00
---
I've come a long way...

---
label: Balloon_01
---
Be wary of that place...

---
label: Balloon_02

I just want to go home...
