{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Link! Is that really you?{{delay8}} When did you get
out from the castle?!

I'm so ashamed... I've been on watch
duty here this whole time, and I didn't
see you at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}I've really got to get serious about my
training...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Captain Hoz doesn't know that you're
back, does he, Link?

You should report to him right away. He's
on the gate tower at the top of the hill,
past the lower gates.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm sure the captain will be just as
surprised to see you as I was!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Captain Hoz is going to be returning to
his original duties with the monster-
control crew.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'm on guard duty here, making sure no
thieves sneak into the castle and steal
any of the {{color id="0"}}treasures{{color id="-1"}} there.
You can count on me to keep the castle
safe, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}I might not match you for skill, Link, but
I've been training hard, and I'm pretty
confident in my abilities!
So never fear! I'm keeping watch, and I'll
make sure no thieves sneak past me and
steal any of the castle's {{color id="0"}}treasures{{color id="-1"}}.
You can count on me to keep the castle
safe, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But, uh...be on your guard, OK? There's a
terrifying monster called a {{color id="0"}}Gloom Spawn{{color id="-1"}}
lurking around here.
If you see a {{color id="0"}}moving mass of gloom{{color id="-1"}}, fall
back as fast as you can!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}It's some kind of monster completely
coated in {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}. And if it touches you,
it'll steal away your vitality!
It has strange wriggly things protruding all
over... It's a real sight.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If it spots you, it'll try and chase you
down. Sorry, but I don't know any more
than that...
