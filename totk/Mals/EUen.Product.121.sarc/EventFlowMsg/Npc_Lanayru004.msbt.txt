{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hello, are you hunting fireflies? This is the best
place to collect the sunset firefly you can find in
the evenings.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}Oh, sorry. I was whispering again,
wasn't I?

I'm in the habit of whispering to avoid
scaring off the fireflies.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Oh, you caught me humming.{{delay8}} It's a good

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Even if it's a detour, it's worth coming
here to see the sunset fireflies dancing
around in the forest at night.

here, so collecting them's easy. So long

Are you looking for a place to sleep?

Highland Stable is just ahead of here. {{delay15}}It's
an amazing inn where you can enjoy

Or maybe you're here looking for the

the area?

strange woodland animals?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've spotted this mysterious creature in
the forest quite a few times.{{delay8}} If you
approach it, it glows blue and darts off.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Nope, nothing like the sunset firefly. {{delay15}}This
is a whole different animal.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I followed after it once and ended up in
some nasty ruins where I narrowly
averted death.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm heading down the road now to

You can hop a lift on my wagon, if you

friends too.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Oh. {{delay8}}You caught me humming the tune
I wrote—Frenetic Dance of the Firefly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The name's Eryck. I'm a free spirit who
travels where the wind blows me.{{delay15}} Once
upon a time, anyway.
A while back, during one of my windswept

I fell to the ground.

dancing in the moonlight was so beautiful,
I thought I had landed in another world.
Before that night, I was a free spirit.
After? Enthralled by the firefly.
