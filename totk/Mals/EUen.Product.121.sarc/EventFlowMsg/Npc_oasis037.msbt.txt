our big {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} investigation.

You're here about our newspaper, right? Then
you can talk to me too. I'm next in charge.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_235

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I gotta say, you did a good job finding us
out here. Some go right on by.

It's pretty unusual for a newspaper to be
run out of a stable. Traysi cheated the
previous owner out of this place.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But you see things like they are, don't
you? Hmm...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, want to be a reporter? Shine
light on the truth? Expose the evils

I could put in a word with Traysi for you...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh, wait a minute...{{delay8}} It's you!{{delay15}} I gotta say,
you did a good job getting out here to
find us.
It's quite a hike from Lookout Landing
when you haven't got wings, but here you
are! Was it easy to find the place?
Some folks pass by without a second look.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}After all, it was a stable, until Traysi
cheated the previous owner out of it.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But you don't miss a thing, do you?
Not bad, not bad at all...{{pageBreak}}I assume you came for the job. You
want to work for the newspaper, right?
I'll vouch for you with Traysi.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Just picture it! Traveling the world as a
reporter, shining light on the truth! We'll
be partners out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}Don't you listen, Penn? I told you I was

from the owner after we came to a fair,

Could you stop telling people I cheated
him out of it?

I'm the editor of the Lucky Clover Gazette
here, if you couldn't tell. So, don't worry.

I know everyone involved with this story.
{{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}} asked us for help digging into

Don't worry. {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}} asked us for help

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Interesting...{{delay frames="30" otherArg="0x0000"}} So that's why she's asked
you to investigate places seriously
impacted by the Upheaval.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, coming here was a great call!


What I mean is, we're getting tips from all
over Hyrule. So many, in fact, that it's
been hard to keep up!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And among those tips, we've been
hearing about {{color id="0"}}someone who looks like the
princess{{color id="-1"}} appearing in all sorts of places.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was about to assign {{color id="0"}}Penn {{color id="-1"}}to chase
those leads, but he could use a partner.

I won't tell Penn who you are. It's better
if no one knows you're involved.

What do you say? Think you could work
with him as we investigate?

---
label: Talk_282
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Interesting...{{delay15}} You heard {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}'s
voice while you were up in the sky, and
now you're {{color id="0"}}searching for her{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you reported that to {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}}? Head
to {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}} if you haven't. It's
near the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins.
I'm sure that she'd be relieved to see
your face, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, you're here at least. Good instincts,
coming to the newspaper. We get leads
about all sorts of things in Hyrule.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}We've heard about someone who looks
like the princess appearing here and
there too.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I was about to assign {{color id="0"}}Penn{{color id="-1"}} to chase
those leads, but he could use a partner.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I won't tell Penn who you are. It's better

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, I wouldn't ask you to do this
for free—though that'd be nice.

Wait just a second. I'm going to get you
a little incentive from the back.

With that on, it's easy to cling to wet

these news stories, then I'll give you this
armor. Piece by piece, all yours.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}A pretty good deal there, Link...{{delay15}}


Anyway,{{delay8}} that's my offer.

then looks like I had you sized up right.
Traysi knows how to pick 'em.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, you two. Here's what you're
going to do—{{color id="0"}}visit every stable{{color id="-1"}} for leads.
Penn, you'll head this all up.
Stables bring in people, and people bring
details. And details are what we need.
Now...{{delay15}}get me some news!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, that set of {{color id="0"}}froggy armor{{color id="-1"}} caught
your eye?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}With that, you'll {{color id="0"}}cling to wet surfaces
without slipping{{color id="-1"}}, great if you need to stay
on the lookout from unexpected places.
Work with Penn to {{color id="0"}}get to the bottom of
the rumors {{color id="-1"}}about Princess Zelda. I'll give
you froggy armor, piece by piece.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll have you know that full set of froggy
armor is one of my newspaper's most-
valuable assets.
With that, you'll cling to wet surfaces
with no fear of slipping. But you're going
to have to earn it.
You work with Penn to {{color id="0"}}get to the bottom
of the rumors {{color id="-1"}}about Princess Zelda...

and I'll give you that froggy armor,
piece by piece. First you've got to make
your editor here happy.

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm counting on you to visit all of the
stables in Hyrule.

Think of those stables as soup pots full
of all kinds of tasty leads. Get out there
and spoon up that news.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've heard from Penn. So, you must be
here to pick up some of the {{color id="0"}}froggy

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That's what I thought you wanted, but

all the news you've chased so far.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd hand over some of the {{color id="0"}}froggy armor{{color id="-1"}},
but you'll need to free up space in your
pack first.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh yeah, that'll look good on you.{{delay15}}


Oh, take this too.

That will really help you stick to wet
surfaces without slipping.

She's looking into a rumor about some
kind of underground city there...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}She's a little too quick to trust people, in
my opinion. I hope she's not chasing a
lead that goes nowhere...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Readers all over Hyrule have their eyes

The Lucky Clover Gazette is equally eager

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}How's it going? Are you and Penn

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right now, he should be
canvassing at {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks Stable{{color id="-1"}} over
in {{color id="0"}}west Necluda{{color id="-1"}} in southeastern Hyrule.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The Yiga Clan recently sent the paper
a {{color id="0"}}statement concerning Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}},
you see.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It definitely shook me at first, but then I
reminded myself that it could just be a
bunch of hot air.
Regardless, I asked Penn to figure out if it
was true or not.

---
label: Talk_Tribune03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing at {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Bridge Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That'd be around the bridge that connects
{{color id="0"}}Tabantha Frontier {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Ridge{{color id="-1"}},
directly south of here.
I heard some of the livestock at the
stable suddenly disappeared...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}He took off that way...said something
about his reporter's instincts shouting
at him.

---
label: Talk_Tribune04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing at {{color id="0"}}Riverside Stable{{color id="-1"}} along
the river in {{color id="0"}}southeast Hyrule Field{{color id="-1"}}.
That stable is all about fine dining. It's
ALWAYS packed with gourmets looking
for the next big dish.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ya know, Penn is a bit of a gourmet
himself, so maybe he flew straight there.

---
label: Talk_Tribune05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing at {{color id="0"}}Wetland Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you know it? It's the place right
across {{color id="0"}}Rebonae Bridge{{color id="-1"}}, over in eastern
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Field{{color id="-1"}}.
Actually, it's pretty close to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}}. That's where those ruins—the
Ring Ruins I think— fell down.
With all that going on, there have been
a lot more travelers in the area. And that
means more information and rumors!
Penn had a hunch he'd be able to find
some good info there, so he headed out
that way.

---
label: Talk_Tribune06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a place out to the east, past the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}.

It used to be somewhere else, but after
the new road was built, the place moved
to the new location.
Seems like it was the right move—
business is booming there!

I'm not sure if that's why he headed
out there though.

All he said was "The little birds are
calling!" Then he took off with a big
grin on his face.

---
label: Talk_Tribune07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's a stable far, far, faaar to the south
of here. It's right on the border between
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Field {{color id="-1"}}and the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo{{color id="-1"}} region.
A {{color id="0"}}huge Zonai ruin {{color id="-1"}}fell near there, so
there've been a lot of researchers on
top of the usual travelers visiting.
"Where there are people, there's info!"{{delay15}}
That's what Penn said, anyway. Not quite
how I'd put it, but true all the same.

---
label: Talk_Tribune09

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Take the road out front and {{color id="0"}}head north{{color id="-1"}}.
You'll get there soon enough. Oh, but it's
in the {{color id="0"}}Hebra region{{color id="-1"}}, so pack warm!
Talk out of that part of the world is
all about a rare horse that may have
been spotted.
Penn was going on about how his "wild
sense" was calling to him.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Wild sense, ha...{{delay15}} He should start with basic sense
before working his way up to anything clever...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing near {{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The stable there is right on the border
of the {{color id="0"}}Eldin {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}Akkala {{color id="-1"}}regions, off to
the northeast.
Penn headed that way, sayin' his little
birds gave him a hot scoop on somethin'
really strange...
Apparently, there's a talkin' Cucco
out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I told him there was absolutely no way
that was possible...

And he told me there was absolutely
no way his little birds would lie, then
he flew off.

---
label: Talk_Tribune11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right now, I expect he's at
{{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable{{color id="-1"}} to the northeast, near the
border between Eldin and Akkala.
In times past, the stable was a busy
place since it was right on the way to
Goron City.
But with the new road having been
built, the stable started seeing fewer
customers...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Seems that's changed lately though.
We heard about some barely clothed
folks crowding around the place!
I won't lie, I was planning to investigate
this one myself...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}But Penn beat me to it and took off quick
as can be. As he flew away, he said,
"Distracted eyes miss the info prize!"
Whatever that means...

---
label: Talk_Tribune13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing {{color id="0"}}Highland Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

That stable is right at the most southern
edge of Hyrule.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Penn's little birds told him that
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda's voice{{color id="-1"}} had been
heard around there.
He took off without a peep or a cheep!

---
label: Talk_Tribune14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's the last stable you'd find on the
road before headin' into the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo
Desert{{color id="-1"}} in the southwest part of Hyrule.
The weather down there swings between
hot and cold, and horses can't go into
the desert...
There've been rumors the stable is going
to shut down.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Penn said he needed to hurry and gather
as much info as he could before anythin'
like that happened...
Then he was gone faster than you can
say "goodbye." I know that for sure
'cause all I heard from him was "goodb—"

---
label: Talk_Tribune16

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Let's see... Right around now, he should
be canvassing {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's a stable in the {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}} region off to
the northeast. It's a good stop if you're
on your way to Goron City.
When a {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} showed up there,
that was all anyone talked about!

At least for a while. There hasn't been
any news lately...

So of course Penn has headed that
way. He said he could smell the scoop
from here.

the latest.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We're relieved that you managed to get

Until then, Link, you keep doing what

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As for Penn, well, I've given him some
time off with pay. Well-deserved too!
He did a lot of reporting.
I did tell him, "Hey, you say something
nice to your partner after all this?"

I think I put him on the spot, Link. He
looked at me in an odd way and flew off
with barely a "Soar long."
He was right in the middle of writing a

I know you already have your hands full
{{color id="0"}}searching for Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}, after all.{{delay15}}

But...really...once all this is over, I may
just have a real reporter job available for
you. Hopefully you'd like that!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I'd thought Penn would be here to say
somethin' as well, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}When I mentioned it to him, he said,
"I've got to get to training and improve
myself! It's the only way to stay ahead!"

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I probably should have told him to take
it easy and say somethin' to you, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Yeah, he said he was gonna head to a
place called...{{delay15}} Whatcha's? Watchers?
Wassa's? Hm.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Well! In any case, I know it's some kind of
{{color id="0"}}bluff{{color id="-1"}}! That much is certain.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's at the edge of {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Ridge {{color id="-1"}}off to
the south, though I don't remember
exactly where.
He also said somethin' about a famous
bard? And that the only way to improve
himself was to go there.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? You were able to find Washer's...
Wassur's...Wasper's... {{delay15}}That bluff that
Penn mentioned?
He was pretty smug about how the place
could only be reached by those with
wings too...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, he owes you for all the research you
did as his partner. It let him write about
Princess Zelda, after all.
He'd told me he needed to become
someone his own partner can rely on...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I think I'm lookin' forward to the next
time I see Penn!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I was glad to hand over that whole set of
froggy armor, Link. You earned it.

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Besides, it was an impulse buy. Didn't fit me or my
sisters. Or Penn.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry... I know worryin' after Penn
is a small thing compared to all the other
stuff going on.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We at the newspaper might only be able
to send out the news we hear...

But we'll do all we can to help you find
Princess Zelda!

And don't forget, Link—if you're ever
feeling lost, reading the newspaper might
just help you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And of course we've heard news about
the return of the Demon King.

We even rushed an extra edition out just
to share that news!
