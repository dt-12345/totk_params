{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hiya, Linky. Popping by to make
an appearance?

I don't see any visible injuries...{{delay15}} So you
must be holding up OK out there.

Have you made any progress on
investigating the {{color id="0"}}four regions{{color id="-1"}} like
I asked?
There's {{color id="0"}}another village that might
yield more answers{{color id="-1"}}, so I'm directing an
investigation into what's gone on there.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What's going on?{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}For my part, I've been thinking a lot about
{{color id="0"}}this village {{color id="-1"}}aside from the {{color id="0"}}four regions{{color id="-1"}}
I asked you to check out.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm hoping to learn more about the

Four regions?

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You've got to be kidding... This is exactly
what you should be using your {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad{{color id="-1"}}
for. {{delay8}}Did you forget or something?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I guess that's in character for you,
isn't it.

Can I see the Purah Pad?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I want you to look into these {{color id="0"}}four regions{{color id="-1"}}
where {{color id="0"}}strange phenomena{{color id="-1"}} are causing
major problems.
That's Hebra, {{delay8}}Eldin, {{delay8}}Gerudo, {{delay8}}and Lanayru.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You might want to start with {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}up in
the northwest{{color id="-1"}}, where {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}was
supposedly sighted.

---
label: talk_3_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Keep in mind Hebra is colder than usual
due to a {{color id="0"}}serious cold front{{color id="-1"}} that blew
in recently.
You'll want to show up {{color id="0"}}prepared with
cold-weather gear{{color id="-1"}}, otherwise you'll turn
into an icicle pretty quick.

---
label: talk_3_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm leaving those regions with phenomena
in your hands, so make me proud.

I've also got that {{color id="0"}}other village on my

to look into what's going on there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, home of the {{color id="0"}}Sheikah
tribe{{color id="-1"}}. It's off to the southeast in the
Necluda region.
{{color id="0"}}Zonai ruins{{color id="-1"}}, each {{color id="0"}}shaped like a ring{{color id="-1"}}, fell
directly on top of the village.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There's got to be a {{color id="0"}}special reason {{color id="-1"}}for it.


Right now, the Zonai Survey Team's
{{color id="0"}}elites {{color id="-1"}}are taking on the investigation.

If you want to know {{color id="0"}}about the Zonai{{color id="-1"}}, you
should talk to them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a relatively new place called {{color id="0"}}Tarrey

Landing and the Skyview Towers.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a village in southeastern Hyrule called
{{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}. It's one of the largest
Hyrulean villages there is.
Robbie and I have a {{color id="0"}}lab{{color id="-1"}} we use there as a
base for our research.

Fortunately that area hasn't been
bothered by random objects raining
down out of the sky.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Although, there's been unrest in the
village, from what I've heard. Arguments
breaking out. Things like that.
Princess Zelda created a {{color id="0"}}school{{color id="-1"}} there
and was trying to use the village as a
starting point for restoring Hyrule.
Up until recently, it was a very peaceful
place, you see.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a fishing village called {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}
on the southeastern edge of Hyrule.

The village is currently overrun by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.
Some villagers fled, while some stayed
put, so they're scattered all over.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I feel like I should've kept a closer watch
on that village. But it's far away, so news
from there to here doesn't travel quickly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh yeah, another thing. {{color id="0"}}Josha{{color id="-1"}} is recruiting
for the chasm-research team. She's been
struggling to find capable people to help.
She's young, but she's a real prodigy. She
outperforms most of the adults here, and
she's deeply committed to her research.
You might consider talking to her and
seeing if there's some way you can
pitch in.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oho, if it isn't Link. I failed to mention
this, but I told Purah about the village
earlier.
You helped Tulin grow so much during
your adventure together...

{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}For that, I am very grateful.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}We've all been talking about how best to
pitch in from here,{{delay15}} and we'd like to help
with the search for Princess Zelda!
We Rito are the most obvious choice for
covering the sky territories. We'll guard
from above and check the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, look who it is. I told Purah about all

Without your guidance, I don't think Tulin
would have matured so much in such a
short time.
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thank you, Link.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Despite everything you helped with,{{delay15}} we'd
still be helping to find Princess Zelda
either way.
We Rito are the obvious right pick for
scouring the skies. We'll be protecting the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that Lady Riju has awakened as a

to monsters.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I think of her often... I haven't left Lady

It's hard not to feel sad about it, but as
long as Lady Riju is moving forward, so
will I.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We Gerudo will assist in the search for

For now, we'll fortify the {{color id="0"}}gates{{color id="-1"}} and

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Apparently Purah spotted a figure within
Hyrule Castle.

I flew off as soon as I could to try to
see who it might be, but I wasn't able
to discern anything, unfortunately.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It must have been a false alarm. I got
so worked up, thinking it might be
Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Even so, I'm curious.
