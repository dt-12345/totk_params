{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Phew. You're just another real, living
person... I was certain one of the ghosts
haunting this place had come for me!
I traveled out here hoping to meet the
wonderful, amazing Gerudo women who
lived here, but there's...no one...
I do sometimes hear voices coming up
{{color id="0"}}from the wells{{color id="-1"}}. Oh, and I also occasionally
see {{color id="0"}}small shadows moving to the west{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Obviously the place is now haunted by the
restless spirits of the beautiful Gerudo
who were slain by the strange monsters!
If I'm not careful, the same monsters
might get me too...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I came all this way to meet the dazzling
Gerudo who lived here. I can't believe
they've all been killed...

No doubt about it—those are all signs that

here still...

Something about a {{color id="0"}}secret{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} Could this be the reason
