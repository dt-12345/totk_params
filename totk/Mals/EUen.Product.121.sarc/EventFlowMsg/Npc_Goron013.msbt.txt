Mine-Cart Land?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry 'bout all that, traveler.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Mine-Cart Land {{color id="-1"}}is an amusement park
that we started buildin' at the request of
{{color id="0"}}President Yunobo{{color id="-1"}}, head of {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}.
He wanted to create an attraction to draw
travelers in—somethin' fun.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But lately all the young Gorons won't do a
lick of work, and the project's come to a
screeching halt.

YunoboCo?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}YunoboCo handles everything from minin'
ore to sellin' it. We rely on 'em to keep
our economy going.
They had big plans for {{color id="0"}}Mine-Cart Land{{color id="-1"}},
but it looks like the grand openin' is a
ways off yet.
Oh, and if it's ore yer after, try going to
the {{color id="0"}}company store{{color id="-1"}} up ahead. Or ya can
get some in the city.
Their prices are {{color id="0"}}half{{color id="-1"}} of what's normal, so
ya get a good deal.
