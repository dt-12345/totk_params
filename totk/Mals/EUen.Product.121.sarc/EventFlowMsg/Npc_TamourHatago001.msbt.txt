Love the flowers!

Is that thing a horse?

That's Princess Zelda's...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}G'morning!

label: Talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello!

label: Talk02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Evening!

---
label: Talk10

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks for sending those monsters
packing. {{delay8}}Now I'm right where I wanna
be, back at my horses' side!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The horses have been so patient!
They waited this whole time for me
to come back.
After I'm done here, I'll treat them to a
leisurely trot to {{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...Assuming the rain has stopped, that is.

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Then again, I wouldn't want 'em to get
scared by that picture of the {{color id="0"}}rumored
beast {{color id="-1"}}hanging there.
Maybe it'd be better to go elsewhere...

South Akkala Stable?

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Never heard of {{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}}
That's all right. I'll tell you about it.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}You forgot what I told you about it, huh?
That's OK.{{delay8}} I don't mind repeating myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable {{color id="-1"}}is southwest of here,
across the Akkala Highlands.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Supposedly {{delay8}}there's a {{color id="0"}}Cucco there who
gives prophecies{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

I know, hard to believe. But what it says
usually turns out to be true.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Supposedly{{delay8}} they used to have a {{color id="0"}}Cucco
there who gave prophecies{{color id="-1"}}.

Turns out it was just a Yiga Clan member
in disguise! That caused quite the stir.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There are a lot of sheep there too, which
I found pretty shocking... {{delay8}}What kind of
stable has sheep?
They also have a {{color id="0"}}picture of that rumored
beast {{color id="-1"}}on the wall. It's an odd stable.

---
label: 0003
---
Rumored beast?

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh! {{delay15}}The rumors about a {{color id="0"}}strange beast{{color id="-1"}}
are really making the rounds. Everyone's
talking about this creature.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}My thoughts tend to dwell on the god of
horses, not some rumored beast.

But from what I've heard, the rumor is
traveling among the stables. I'll admit I
know nothing at all about this beast.
There's a picture of it hung up at
{{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}, however, if
you want to see what it looks like.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}With the pirates gone, I've got a lot of
work to catch up on.

I wonder when I'll be able to take the
horses for a walk...

label: Talk31

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wonder when I'll have time to take my
horses for a stroll...

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Got something else to ask?


If it's the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}you want to
know about, you'd be better off going
to {{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk20

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Phew, I'm beat!{{delay15}} A hard day's work'll do
that to you.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Ah...{{delay8}} This is the perfect music to relax to
after a long day of work.

Good thing the Stable Trotters are back!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Evening!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Evening!{{delay8}} Shame about the rain, huh?

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You planning to check out that {{color id="0"}}picture
of the rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}over there at
{{color id="0"}}South Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}?
