{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh my. It's a traveler, darling.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} has grown quite popular,
after all.

---
label: Talk_0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's all thanks to President Mudson.

---
label: Talk_0057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}}, darling, not "Mudson."


You shouldn't forget a {{color id="0"}}founder of
Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0061
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ooh, that's right. President Budson.

---
label: Talk_0062
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}{{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}}, darling, Hudson. Not "Budson."

label: 0000
---
Goodbye.

---
label: 0001
---
Hudson?

---
label: Talk_0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}He's the president of {{color id="0"}}Hudson
Construction{{color id="-1"}}, who built this town.

---
label: Talk_0045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Eh? Didn't they open an office
around here?

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Over there, darling.


It's the place with the sign you always
mistake for {{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}} and say hello to.

---
label: Talk_0046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry about that.


My husband has been getting more
forgetful lately.

Never mind us. Please enjoy your visit.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh my, a traveler! Good evening.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh my, a traveler! Hello.

---
label: Talk_0096
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh my, a traveler! Good morning.

---
label: Talk_0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thanks to{{color id="0"}} Hudson{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town {{color id="-1"}}has
grown rather famous.

---
label: Talk_0082
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's "Budson," dear.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, good morning.

---
label: Talk_0088

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hello.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, good evening.

---
label: Talk_0090
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh dear. Traveling in the rain, I see.

---
label: Near_0001
---
Oh dear...

---
label: Talk_0095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It won't do to chit-chat in the rain. Why
don't we continue this under a roof?

---
label: Talk_0074
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh my, another traveler?{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} has grown quite popular,
after all.

All of that is thanks to {{color id="0"}}President Hudson{{color id="-1"}}.


I'm so very grateful.

---
label: Talk_0078
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Tarrey Town has grown popular indeed if
visitors are coming at this hour.

Are you here to see the Unity Bell?


It's become quite famous since {{color id="0"}}President
Hudson{{color id="-1"}} hosted his wedding there.

As for me, the bell marks the perfect
distance for my little strolls.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The fountain always brings me peace,
even if I'm just passing by.

---
label: Talk_0097
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}To me, the Unity Bell is just a useful
landmark for my strolls around town.

But I've heard folks come in from out
of town just to see it.

The bell's become quite famous since
{{color id="0"}}President Hudson{{color id="-1"}} had his wedding there.

---
label: Talk_0100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you here to see Tarrey Town's Unity
Bell? You know, there's a Goddess Statue
in the area as well.
{{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}} even had his wedding at the bell.

---
label: Talk_0083
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard the {{color id="0"}}president {{color id="-1"}}is in the office at
the moment. That doesn't happen often
these days.

---
label: Talk_0076
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm talking about the president of {{color id="0"}}Hudson
Construction{{color id="-1"}}. He helped build this town.

---
label: Talk_0091
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}See that cutout? That's Hudson. Not the
real Hudson, of course.

But my husband can't always tell, and
sometimes he'll greet the sign like it's
the man himself.

---
label: Talk_0093
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you seen that person-shaped
cutout, hm?

That's a painting of Hudson, sure enough.


It's such a fine likeness that my husband
has a habit of greeting the sign.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I need to sleep soon. I've got an early day
again tomorrow, after all.

---
label: Talk_Sleep
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}Darling... {{delay15}}Not that direction...

---
label: Talk_0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}Where has that girl gone off to?

---
label: Talk_0063
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, Mattison! {{delay8}}There you are.{{delay8}} You've
gotten so big.

---
label: Talk_0064
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's not her, darling.{{pageBreak}}Didn't Mattison say she was {{color id="0"}}going
back home{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_0065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, that's right. To President Budson's.

---
label: Talk_0066
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Darling, it's Hudson, not "Budson."

---
label: Talk_0059
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah, Mattison.{{delay8}} ...Oh? {{delay8}} What broad
shoulders you have nowadays.

---
label: Talk_0084
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I told you, darling, that's not her.{{pageBreak}}Mattison is probably {{color id="0"}}back at home{{color id="-1"}}
by now.

---
label: Talk_0077
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm friends with Hudson's whole family.


I'm especially fond of their only daughter,
Mattison. What a dear.

---
label: Talk_0102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Still...

---
label: Talk_0094
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}My husband isn't the only one who has
trouble remembering things. Age isn't
kind to memory.
I need to learn from Mattison's example
and write down important things in
a {{color id="0"}}notebook{{color id="-1"}}.
It's awfully sad to think that I only have
a little longer to play with Mattison.

---
label: Talk_0069
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I hope Mattison will be all right on
the railcar.{{pageBreak}}It's been harder to use ever since Hagie
became the manager.

---
label: Talk_0070
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Eh? What is he doing?

---
label: Talk_0071
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, he charges a {{color id="0"}}fee{{color id="-1"}} to use it now,
doesn't he, darling?

Paying for a ride would be a problem for a
child, after all.

---
label: Talk_0060
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wonder if Mattison will be able to board
the railcar. Hopefully the manager
won't stop her.

---
label: Talk_0085
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hm... {{delay8}}But if the manager doesn't see her,
he won't be able to stop her.

---
label: Talk_0079
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Still, I hope Mattison will be all right.


The railcar has been harder to use
ever since Hagie became the manager.

---
label: Talk_0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm so pleased Mattison was able to board
the railcar to see Hudson.{{pageBreak}}I wonder if the manager turned a blind
eye for her this time.

---
label: Talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With a blind eye, it couldn't have been
hard for her to sneak by, after all.

---
label: Talk_0086
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}By the way, {{delay8}}where was Mattison going on
the railcar?

---
label: Talk_0073
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}She went to help Hudson. She's such a
sweet vai for one so young.

---
label: Talk_0080
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm so pleased Mattison was able to board
the railcar to see President Hudson.{{pageBreak}}I wonder if the manager turned a blind
eye for her this time.

---
label: Talk_0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Speaking of Hudson, it seems his
daughter, Mattison,{{delay8}} was able to board
the railcar.
I wonder if the manager turned a blind
eye for her this time.

---
label: Talk_0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We were talking about how Hudson
and Rhondson had their wedding
ceremony here.
I do hope we're still around to see
Mattison's wedding ceremony.

---
label: Talk_0067
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Why wouldn't we be? You're still a young
woman, dear.

---
label: Talk_0068
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Hehe. That's right.

---
label: Talk_0075
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I hope someday when Mattison grows up,
she has her wedding ceremony here, just
like her parents.

---
label: Talk_0087
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'm looking forward to it!

---
label: Talk_0081
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ever since Mattison moved, even the
Goddess Statue seems lonely.

I hope someday when Mattison's all grown
up, she has her wedding ceremony here,
just like her parents.

---
label: Talk_0098
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hope when Mattison grows up, she'll
want to have her wedding here. Just like
her parents.

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh my! {{delay8}}Do you need something in
my house?{{pageBreak}}I don't have much to offer, but make
yourself at home.

---
label: Talk_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh my! {{delay8}}You again?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I suppose if you're so comfortable here,
you might as well make yourself at home.
