{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Did you stop by our branch because you
were worried about us?

I admit, we've been hurting ever since
Link freed the tailor who was making
our uniforms.
But at least he was so focused on the
tailor that he didn't manage to steal
anything on his way out.
{{anim type="LaughBad"}}He didn't even touch our {{color id="0"}}journal{{color id="-1"}} or the
{{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}with the locations of our hideouts.
And they call this moron a hero? Ha!

---
label: Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Our {{color id="0"}}journal{{color id="-1"}} and the {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} marked with our
other hideouts are completely untouched.
What a moron!
And besides, these branches are just
footholds for Master Kohga's domination
of {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}.
Our enemies can attack them all they
want—his ambitions will not falter!

label: Talk_100

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Link! Thought you could sneak past us,
did you?!

Come out front, and let's settle this!{{playSound id="90" otherArg="0x0000"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I'll give those miserable Sheikah one
thing—they made us a decent laboratory.

---
label: Talk_201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughBad"}}What did they think was going to happen
after leaving it alone for so long?

We've taken over this place. It's now the
{{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan's Akkala Branch{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}They left some {{color id="0"}}parts {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}materials{{color id="-1"}} lying
around here too.

Those might be useful, so send them to
the hideout's research team right away.

---
label: Talk_203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}How "right away" are we talking, here?


I mean, we're in {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}—northeast
Hyrule—and the hideout is all the way
southwest in the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo region{{color id="-1"}}.
Since it's on the {{color id="0"}}completely opposite{{color id="-1"}} side
of the map, I get the feeling that might
take a while...

---
label: Talk_205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Stow the complaints!


The role of the branches is to provide
intel and supplies to the hideout's
{{color id="0"}}labs {{color id="-1"}}and our {{color id="0"}}bases in the Depths{{color id="-1"}}!
Anything we think is useful goes to the
{{color id="0"}}hideout{{color id="-1"}}! That's the ironclad rule!

---
label: Talk_207
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}M-my apologies! I'll pass those supplies
along as quickly as I can!

---
label: Talk_208
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I swear, that Link! It's like he just popped
up out of nowhere!

He's just as cowardly as the rumors say!

---
label: Talk_211
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's annoying that Link set the tailor who
made our outfits free...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_209
---
{{anim type="LaughBad"}}But he didn't even touch our {{color id="0"}}journals {{color id="-1"}}or
the {{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}with the locations of our other
hideouts. What a moron!
Inform the main {{color id="0"}}hideout {{color id="-1"}}that the damage
to this branch was minimal. Quickly, now!

---
label: Talk_000_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration"}}Aha. Judging from your imposing stance,
you must be our newest blademaster.

I've heard all sorts of stories about you.
Have you come to support this branch?

Your help is appreciated. Link set our
tailor free, so things have been hectic.
I admit, we let down our guard there.
{{anim type="LaughBad"}}We're just lucky Link is such a moron!
He didn't even notice our {{color id="0"}}journals {{color id="-1"}}or the
{{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}marked with our hideouts! Ha!
