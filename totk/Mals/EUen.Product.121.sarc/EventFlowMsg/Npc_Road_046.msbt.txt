anytime and anywhere!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, friend! Explored any caves lately?


That's where almost all ore is these days.
And given caves are everywhere, that
means they're an easy way to find ore.
But finding isn't keeping. You'll bump into
monsters you won't see up here. It's a
whole different world in those caves.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Still, hard to resist trying to strike it
rich down there!

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm going to strike it rich in caves
someday by grabbing all the ore I can.
You should do it too, friend. If you can.
Got to admit, though, I'm scared of
what's lurking in caves. You won't see
any of THOSE monsters up here.

label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hey, friend! Working hard?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're ever low on fuel, make yourself
some energizing elixir.

First, you'll need restless crickets. Cut
some grass, and watch those li'l guys
jump out. Catch them quick.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Then mix those with monster parts to
whip up an energizing elixir!

That elixir really helps in a pinch. Can't
recommend it enough.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't even tell you how many times
an energizing elixir has saved me when
I've needed...{{delay8}}to go...{{delay8}}a little farther!
You'll need restless crickets. Easy
enough to find. Cut some grass, and
grab them when they hop out.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Oh, yes. I can vouch for those elixirs!{{delay15}}
I just can't get ahold of the monster
parts you'll need as easily.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Traveling merchants like me, the ones
pulling wagons? When it's raining, we
don't get to take the day off.
You know why? Because people need us!
They need us to bring them elixirs,
ingredients...other stuff!
Especially now that the Upheaval's made
it harder to walk to shops.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We're basically the glue holding this
cracked-up world together!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Destruction from the Upheaval made it
harder for people to travel to shops.

That's why people in my line of work—{{delay8}}the
folks who bring your goods to YOU—{{delay8}}are
so important right now.
We're basically the glue holding this
cracked-up world together...{{delay8}}and glue
doesn't go home when it's raining!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hey there, friend. You mind if I get
something off my chest? Oh, yeah.
I had a bad time of it.
I went into a cave and saw a monster
that's going to haunt my dreams.

The thing...{{delay15}}stretched.


And then contracted. Over and over—
stretched, then contracted.

I think it can eat anything. Yeeesh.
Right down the gullet.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}One of them gulped down my stock.
Cried myself dizzy. I bet their stomachs
are crammed full of stuff.
{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Really...{{delay15}}dang it.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Stretching, contracting. Over and over.
Ugh. Those darn monsters.

Next time I see one, I'm going to drag it
right out of its cave—hard!

Those things have got to be full of stuff
they've swallowed. Doesn't matter what
it is. Sure, yeah. Gulp it down. Gross.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Whew...{{delay15}}I feel better after getting all
that off my chest. Thanks, friend.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, friend. Tired from all your traveling
around yet?

Cook dishes with stamella shrooms
whenever you're tired of being tired.
They'll help you recover stamina.
Stamella shrooms don't really grow near
here. So keep an eye out for them while
traveling elsewhere.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You don't typically see stamella shrooms
around here, but you can find them in
other regions.
You can cook some great dishes with
them, meals that'll get you going again
when you get tired during your travels.

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey there, friend. I've been thinking
about a beautiful rumor...

It's said that there's a cherry-blossom
tree in the mountains around here that
blossoms all year round.
And also...{{delay15}}that a strange, wondrous
creature called Satori sometimes hides
away there.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'd love to see such a wonder once in
my life.

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm curious what that creature known as
Satori is truly like?

It's said to be hiding atop one of the
peaks here, where a cherry-blossom tree
stays in full blossom all year round.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, friend. Been feeling too tired, too
quickly lately?

Then you should cook dishes that have
endura carrots in them. Those will boost
the upper limit of your stamina.
Oh, yeah. Those are tasty dishes for
those of us who need to work for a
longer time before we tire out.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Endura carrots are said to grow in the
mountains around here. I mean, just
so you know.
Although, it's fairly hard work to get up
a mountain, isn't it?

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Some ingredients can stop you from
tiring out as quickly.

That's why I like cooking with
endura carrots!

They're harder to come by these days,
but I hear some can be found in the
mountains here.
I know—steep. But those tasty carrots are
worth the climb!
