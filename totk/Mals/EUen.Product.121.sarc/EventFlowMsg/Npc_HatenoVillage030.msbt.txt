{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I thought that might be you, Link!


Wow, what a relief. You're safe. I was
seriously worried about you. Where have
you BEEN, anyway?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Uh, {{delay8}}sorry.{{delay8}} Just relieved you're back.{{delay8}} So,
you know {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}}'s here, right? You gotta
see her right away if you haven't yet.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But wow, I can't even tell you how happy I
am to see you here at Lookout Landing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Purah always keeps it together, but I'm

lose her cool.
Everyone's been worried since you and

she's been REALLY worried.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I've been sorting out whether or not I can
build a {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}} in Lookout Landing.

Lester has come here to {{color id="0"}}care for the
horses{{color id="-1"}}. So it'd help him out a lot if he
had a proper stable.
The project would likely take me a while
to complete.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But once it's done, you'll be able to take
full advantage, Link!

---
label: Talk_17

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's still gonna be a while before I can
complete the {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}}.

Things need to be just so for Lester,
who's here to {{color id="0"}}take care of the horses{{color id="-1"}}.

So if the design isn't perfect, I'll get an
earful from him.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Pretty stellar craftsmanship, am I right?


Gotta say, I've outdone myself this time!


If you end up boarding your horses here,
they'll have a luxurious time.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ah, Link! Great job out there!


Are you using the {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}}?


You made building that roof look like a

You just pulled it off in no time.
It's real inspiring. I should get to work
improving my carpentry too.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You shopping?


I hear that the shop owner Mubs wants
to expand her offerings.

I was considering adding some more
shelves for her.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mubs used to run a general store back
in her home village.

So she's got a lot of tight connections in
the trade. She stocks goods from all kinds
of regions.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You shopping?


This shop has the best goods in all of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ruins plopped down outta the sky, and

But what's most important is that nobody
got hurt.

Thankfully, we built Lookout Landing to

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If the ruins were to start falling apart,
somebody really could get hurt though,
so I'd like to start mopping this all up.

The Skyview Towers are a result of the

Purah charted out the design work,
naturally, but the project was huge in

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yep! Originally it was just a humble shop
in a small village called {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}} in
{{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}.
But the boss, {{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}}, is just brilliant
when it comes to constructing things.

Princess Zelda caught wind of his
brilliance, and before you knew it, he was
entrusted with restoring all of Hyrule!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I heard that lately he's been {{color id="0"}}making
dream homes{{color id="-1"}} for folks, though I couldn't
tell ya much more about it.
If you're curious, then next time you're
out in Akkala, I recommend dropping
by {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}.
