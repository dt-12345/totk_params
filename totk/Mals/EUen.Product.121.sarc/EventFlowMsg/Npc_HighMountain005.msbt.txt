{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I am concerned for Tulin.{{pageBreak}}He believes that he is fully-fledged, but
he has not yet grasped one of the most
fundamental lessons...{{pageBreak}}One cannot accomplish great feats
without allies at one's side.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I hope he realizes that soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Flight practice and combat training alone
do not make a full-fledged warrior.{{pageBreak}}More than anything, I want Tulin to
understand that.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All the other adults have left the village
to investigate the blizzard or to procure
a supply of food.{{pageBreak}}I believe my husband and I are the only
ones still here.{{pageBreak}}That said, Link, the children have taken
up the adults' responsibilities while they
are away.{{pageBreak}}They have divided up the work between
cooking and running the shops, with each
of them doing their share.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}To see the children working so hard gives
me hope that we will weather this crisis
as we have before.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With the children and adults all working
as one, I believe there's no hardship we
can't overcome.{{pageBreak}}Our harmony is our strength.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thank you, Link. Truly.{{pageBreak}}You have taught Tulin the most valuable
lesson of all.{{pageBreak}}My husband is beside himself with joy and
relief. No one wanted Tulin to come into
his own more than him.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Teba and I shall watch over Tulin so that
he can lend himself to your quest.{{pageBreak}}I will pray with full heart for your good
fortune and Princess Zelda's safety.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Hello, Link. Tulin has matured a great
deal, thanks to your guidance.{{pageBreak}}I, too, have been doing my part to
keep him safe and supported, as a
mother should.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Thank you so much, Link. Now that the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Thank you for saving our village, Link.{{pageBreak}}Were you seeking Kaneli? He is out at
the {{color id="0"}}Flight Range {{color id="-1"}}at the moment.{{pageBreak}}When the blizzard struck, he volunteered
to ensure the {{color id="0"}}Flight Range {{color id="-1"}}was not
damaged by the relentless snows.{{pageBreak}}Though the blizzard has subsided now,
he seems content to stay there.

devote himself to flight tutelage.

While he is away, I have made keeping

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Kaneli passed his duties as elder on to
my husband, Teba. He is content now to
advise rather than lead.{{pageBreak}}Lately, he has been enjoying his new role
as a tutor at the {{color id="0"}}Flight Range{{color id="-1"}}.
