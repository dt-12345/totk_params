You're saying that sword traveled through time
the same way you did?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_001_c
---
Yes. But more importantly, in my original time...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_001_d
---
the Demon King was vulnerable to even the
smallest piece of this sword.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_002_c
---
Even someone like him has vulnerabilities.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_003_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_004_c
---
Then...what exactly are you suggesting we do with
the sword?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_c
---
Over time, the Master Sword is able to absorb sacred
power. It can heal itself and even grow stronger!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_d
---
Curious... If we were able to empower it in that way,
it could be the key to defeating the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_e
---
But...it could take centuries for that sword to grow
strong enough. The power the Demon King wields...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_f
---
I do not see how this can be done. It would be
impossible for you to provide it with sacred power
for so long.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_007_c
---
I can think of one way...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_008_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_010_c
---
You mean...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_aab
---
Yes. I can do it. I have to.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_c
---
I've told you!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_d
---
That act is forbidden for a very good reason! It would
mean throwing yourself awa—

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_e

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_013_bb

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_013_c
---
Oh, Mineru!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_014_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_015_c
---
You...won't be able to change back.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_016_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_016_c
---
The moment I had the sword, I knew what to do.
I knew this was why I came to this era.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_017_c
---
I...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_018_d
---
I want to restore the Master Sword and deliver it
to Link!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_abb
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_ac
---
I understand.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_c
---
You really...have made up your mind?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_020_ac
---


---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_020_c
---
Very well, then. As a Zonai, I bear my share of blame
for these events...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_021_c
---
So I too will devote myself to this goal...and to this
hero of yours.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_022_ab
---
For the swordsman Link, I will do everything I can.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0039_Text_022_ac
---
Even if my body should perish, I will still be with
you in spirit.
