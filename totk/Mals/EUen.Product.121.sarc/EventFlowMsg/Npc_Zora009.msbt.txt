A customer?!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hey, Grandpa!{{delay15}} I know it's been a while,
but we have a customer here!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Grandpa Dentooo! {{delay8}}Oh, come on...

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Sorry about that.


The Hammerhead, our workshop that
we're so very proud of, is temporarily
closed.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}As you know, my grandpa Dento is the
best blacksmith around.

But since the sludge started falling, he's
been in quite the foul mood.

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Even when the sludge comes falling down,
my grandpa stays just like that.

If there's an emergency situation, as his
granddaughter, I'll have to find a way to
carry him to safety.

Ugh, the sludge is so thick.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} A customer!


Welcome to Marot Mart!{{delay8}} Let me tell you
about our fine facilities.

Our convenient general goods store, the
Coral Reef, is open. Yes, even during
these unusual times.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Then there's our esteemed workshop,
The Hammerhead...{{delay8}}which is unfortunately
closed as of now.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Oh, and the one reading dusty old texts in
the library is Laflat.{{delay8}} She's no shopkeeper,
but rather the royal secretary.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Welcome to Marot Mart!


That said, due to the sludge, we're not
getting many customers these days...

So basically the only thing I can do is sing
songs about the sludge.

label: 2004

What are you up to?

---
label: 2009
---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm showing customers around. Except...


Well, the only problem is that no one's
coming around because of the sludge.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}That junk seems to always be on my
mind these days.

I actually wrote a song about the sludge...
You wouldn't want to hear it, would you?

Sing! Sing! Sing!

Some other time.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Great! Then please listen up. AHEM.


I present a work with lyrics by Marot,{{delay8}}
music by Marot,{{delay8}} and performed by,
{{delay8}}you guessed it, {{delay8}}me! Marot!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Humming_00"}}♪Sludge!{{delay8}} Sludge!{{delay8}} It's filling up

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Kee-hee! There you go!{{delay8}} It actually
cheered me up having you listen to
my song!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Wait... {{delay8}}You didn't lose heart because you
had to listen to that...right?

Um, if that's the case... Sorry about that.

I wrote a sequel to my sludge song!
You...want to hear it, right?

What about the original?

Another time.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}YES! OK, listen up.{{delay8}} After reflecting on
the original, I decided to make this one
much more adorable. AHEM.
I present a new work with lyrics by Marot,{{delay8}}
music by Marot,{{delay8}} and performed by,
{{delay8}}you guessed it, {{delay8}}me! Marot!

Filthy sludge, you're running scared!♪

Our sweet domain is finally clean!♪

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}That's the song!{{delay15}} It really was adorable,
wasn't it?

In reality, the sludge is still falling, and
it's not clean in the domain yet. But,
you know, artistic license and all that.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Oh, that?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}HUH?! He wanted that many crabs?


*sigh*{{delay8}} So that's why he was saying all of
that weird crabby stuff.
