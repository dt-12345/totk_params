{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I moved near the stable here so I could

Come back anytime you're looking to

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'd love to enhance your clothing, {{delay8}}but
you don't seem to be carrying any.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hmm? What's this... {{delay15}}You don't have any

Let's take a look, just to be sure.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With the power available to me...{{delay8}}
I can enhance your clothing
{{color id="0"}}a fair amount{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right. You want to enhance the

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}There are some clothing items that can't
be enhanced,{{delay8}} even with my powers.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't do anything with that clothing
item... How about a different one?

label: ComTalk_024

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry, I can't enhance that clothing item.

---
label: ComTalk_025

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry, but that particular clothing item
is out of my hands.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't do anything with that clothing

my sisters' powers...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Please don't ask the impossible of me.
If I could borrow my sisters' powers,
things might be different, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That item... Right now I can't do anything
with it. It might be different if I could
borrow my sisters' powers...

label: ComTalk_029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry, but...{{delay15}}to enhance that clothing
item, I'd need the aid of my sisters'
powers...

label: ComTalk_030

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? It seems like you don't have
enough materials...

---
label: ComTalk_031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh... {{delay8}}If you don't have the materials,
I can't enhance it.

label: ComTalk_032

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}It's unfortunate, but you don't have
enough materials. How about trying
something else?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh... You don't have enough materials!
Why not try another clothing item?

---
label: ComTalk_101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hmm? {{delay8}}You don't have enough rupees.{{delay8}}
You can't get my blessing with my good
will alone!

---
label: ComTalk_102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh? {{delay8}}You don't have enough rupees.
My blessing isn't free, you know.

label: ComTalk_103

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What a shame—you don't have the
rupees required! Why don't you try
something else?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh dear! You don't have enough rupees.
No rupees, no enhancement.

---
label: ComTalk_034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What now? {{delay8}}Are you being modest?
We can try a different clothing item
if you'd like.

---
label: ComTalk_035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All right. {{delay8}}Take your time.

---
label: ComTalk_036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You made a mistake? I guess it happens
from time to time...

---
label: ComTalk_037

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK. {{delay8}}Go ahead and choose again.

---
label: ComTalk_051

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There, take it!

---
label: ComTalk_052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look! {{delay15}}With this level of quality, it's
hardly recognizable.

---
label: ComTalk_053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's just a little thing, but I hope it helps.

---
label: ComTalk_054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes! Done! {{delay15}}I hope you like it.

---
label: ComTalk_039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}All finished!{{delay8}} What do you think? Are you
marveling at its strength? {{delay15}}

Speaking of strength, enhancing clothing
sometimes draws out its {{color id="0"}}true power{{color id="-1"}}.

But only if you wear the whole set! Well,
and not all sets have the potential...
