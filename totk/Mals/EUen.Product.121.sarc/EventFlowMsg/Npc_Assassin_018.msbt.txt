Wow! Another mine!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Can you believe this?!

---
label: talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I've never seen anything like this!

What is it?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Look around you! None of this is naturally
occurring, right?{{delay8}} And do you see that?
That's a {{color id="0"}}construct{{color id="-1"}}! They're really real!

---
label: talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Which means this is an {{color id="0"}}abandoned mine{{color id="-1"}}!
I know that doesn't sound exciting, but
they're the crown jewels of the Depths!
Not only are they full of {{color id="0"}}crystallized
charges{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} but if you talk to a {{color id="0"}}construct{{color id="-1"}},
I hear they'll give you treasure! {{delay8}}So yeah!

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I obviously can't let you take all these
riches from me, can I,{{delay8}} Link?

---
label: talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ancient ruins, real {{color id="0"}}constructs{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} This must
be an {{color id="0"}}abandoned mine{{color id="-1"}}!

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, lucky day! What should I do first?{{delay8}}
Mine {{color id="0"}}crystallized charges{{color id="-1"}}? Try asking a
{{color id="0"}}construct{{color id="-1"}} for its treasure?

---
label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Or kill the only other person who knows
about my discovery?

---
label: talk_1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, great timing! {{delay8}}Get a load of this!


{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Another {{color id="0"}}abandoned mine{{color id="-1"}}! Can you
believe it?!

There should be a big {{color id="0"}}crystallized charge{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere around here.{{delay8}} If you're free,
would you mind taking a look?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There're more {{color id="0"}}constructs{{color id="-1"}} here too.{{delay8}}
Wonder if we'll ever actually learn how
to activate 'em...

label: talk_1042

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, hey, check out this {{color id="0"}}abandoned mine{{color id="-1"}}!


There's gotta be a big {{color id="0"}}crystallized charge{{color id="-1"}}
around here somewhere. Mind helping
me look?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We can worry about the {{color id="0"}}constructs{{color id="-1"}} later.{{delay8}}
Like,{{delay8}} whenever we figure out how to
activate them, later.
