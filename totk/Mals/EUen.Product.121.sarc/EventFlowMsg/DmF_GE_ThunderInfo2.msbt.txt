{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ha! There we go! {{delay8}}Now let's try something
a little trickier...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Aim for those dummies over there...
Maybe we can hit them all with a {{color id="0"}}single
lightning strike{{color id="-1"}}?
Here's an idea... Don't try to hit a
specific dummy.

Instead, aim for the area in the middle of
all three, {{delay15}}like {{color id="0"}}right around where that
rock{{color id="-1"}} is jutting out.
Oh!{{delay8}} But keep in mind that the {{color id="0"}}farther
away{{color id="-1"}} a target is from me, the {{color id="0"}}longer{{color id="-1"}} it will
take me to build up the energy to hit it.
