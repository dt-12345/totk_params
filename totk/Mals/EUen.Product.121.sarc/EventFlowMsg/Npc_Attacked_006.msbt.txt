{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh! What is it?{{delay8}} Don't tell me you and I
are in the same line of work.

You're looking for treasure, aren't you?


Me too. The outfit's just so I could
infiltrate the Zonai Survey Team without
attracting suspicion.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I thought it'd give me access to some
treasure leads...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But it turns out that they don't just hand
those out. Worse yet,{{delay8}} they put me on
dangerous investigations!
What rotten luck.

---
label: Greeting
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I guess I should have stuck to
treasure hunting the old-fashioned way.

Then I'd be free as a bird, like you.

---
label: Greeting_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I was so glad when I got into the
survey team. But then they put me on
research morning, noon, and night...
It's exhausting. {{delay8}}I'm exhausted. {{delay8}}And I still
don't have any leads.

Maybe I should've gone after {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure {{color id="-1"}}like all those rabid {{color id="0"}}Cece fans{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: NightGreet_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}I have to do survey-team work even at
night?{{delay8}} I have the worst luck.

---
label: NightGreet_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Out for a walk at this late hour?{{delay8}}
The night is...{{delay15}}night, you know?

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}I was asked to investigate the chasm
on {{color id="0"}}Hylia Island{{color id="-1"}}, but...{{delay8}}yikes.

If there was treasure in the chasm,
that'd be a different story. {{delay15}}Without any
payoff, I can't say I'm excited.

---
label: StartPoint_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Why didn't they put me on the
{{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}} job? That would've been
a much better deal.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}It's my job to investigate the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} on
that island. {{delay8}}But an investigation that
dangerous is too much for me.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}There are lots of ancient ruins around
this area. {{delay8}}But that place specifically has
long been known as the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This place has long been known as the
{{color id="0"}}Zonai Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}You know, I'd bet there's
gotta be treasure here somewhere.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My sister, Mina, and I used to hunt for
treasure as a pair.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Then she had the bright idea for me to
infiltrate the Zonai Survey Team.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So we split up. {{delay8}}She headed east, and I
came here to scope out leads.

I wonder what she's up to. {{delay8}}Knowing her,
she's hunting for treasure day and night.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Honestly, if you think about it...{{delay8}}I got the
easy job!

So no more complaining! {{delay15}}I'll just shut my
mouth till I got what I came here for!

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I wonder if this rain comes off the sea of
trees to the east.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}At least it's an excuse to take a break
from investigating. So I can't say I really
mind it.

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}There's another {{color id="0"}}chasm northeast of
Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}. I've been ordered to
investigate that one too.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}But I don't want to do such a dangerous
investigation! {{delay8}}Couldn't someone else
handle that chasm for me?

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}There's another {{color id="0"}}chasm {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}northeast of
Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}I was told to go there next
after I'm done here.

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ruins from the ancient past are common
enough in the woods around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But really, they're just a bunch of old
stones and slabs and stuff. None of
that counts as treasure.

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm about to go investigate the {{color id="0"}}chasm in
Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But I really don't want to.{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I mean, there's a {{color id="0"}}huge monster {{color id="-1"}}on the
Bridge of Hylia. With {{color id="0"}}three heads{{color id="-1"}}!

How can they expect me to get any
research done with that thing there?

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm supposed to investigate the {{color id="0"}}chasm at
Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}.

But there's a huge {{color id="0"}}three-headed monster{{color id="-1"}}
on the Bridge of Hylia.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Considering the danger, you'd think
they might let me off the hook, but
nope.{{delay15}} *sigh* {{delay8}}I am not cut out for this.

---
label: BackRange_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm about to go investigate the {{color id="0"}}chasm at
Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But I really don't want to.{{delay15}}


At least someone got rid of that huge,
{{color id="0"}}three-headed monster {{color id="-1"}}that was on the
Bridge of Hylia.
I mean, it's still dangerous there. Just
slightly less so.

---
label: BackRange_01_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There was a huge, three-headed monster
at the Bridge of Hylia. {{delay8}}But now it's gone.
Did someone defeat it?
I guess that'll make it safer to investigate
the {{color id="0"}}chasm at Lake Hylia{{color id="-1"}}.

Not safe, but you know. {{delay8}}Safer.

---
label: BackRange_01_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Chasms {{color id="-1"}}are dangerous. I don't know why
anyone would dive into one by choice!

Besides, the {{color id="0"}}Bridge of Hylia {{color id="-1"}}overlooks a
perfectly good {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}}. Why couldn't
they have had me investigate that?

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I found a cave earlier while I was hunting
for treasure in the {{color id="0"}}woods{{color id="-1"}}.

The inside of it actually {{color id="0"}}looked like a ruin{{color id="-1"}}.
I could just smell the treasure somewhere
in there!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Problem is, after I left, I got all turned
around. I'm lucky I found the road.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But when I'm finished up here, I'll try to
retrace my steps to the cave.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're a treasure hunter, these woods
are a great place to search. Lots of caves
and old ruins.
I even found one {{color id="0"}}cave that looked like
a ruin{{color id="-1"}}! And let me tell you, that place
reeked of treasure.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I just wish I didn't get lost right after I
found it. Now I have no idea where it was.
