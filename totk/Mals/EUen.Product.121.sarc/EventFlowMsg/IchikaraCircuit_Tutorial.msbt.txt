I'd like you to do...

you started within the time limit. Do that,
and we'll call the test drive a success.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Until now, we've never been able to

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}we'll have built another new vehicle—

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Oh, I almost forgot... During the test
