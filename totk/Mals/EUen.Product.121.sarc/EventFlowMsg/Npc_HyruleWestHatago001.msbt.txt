{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Welcome to New Serenne Stable! Awful
weather we're having, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh,{{delay8}} Link! You're gonna get wet!
Go inside! Hurry!

label: Talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh,{{delay8}} Link! Did you come to check in
on Zunk?

Since you worked so hard to make my
wagon complete, I promise...

I'll never {{delay15}}EVER{{delay15}} let anything happen to it!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But is that all you wanted, or do you need
something from me?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I may not be of much help. Unless you
want to hear some of the things I know
about{{color id="0"}} horses{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It's so sweet of you to drop in and
visit Zunk!

You worked so hard to make my wagon
complete. I promise I'm taking care of it!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh... {{delay8}}But was there something else you
came here for?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Did you want me to tell you some things
about {{color id="0"}}horses{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Heheh.{{delay8}} Talking to you always puts a
smile on my face, Link!

Makes me glad that I worked so hard
learning about {{color id="0"}}horses{{color id="-1"}}.

Tell me about horses!

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... Let's see.


I think you know how to catch them...
by sneaking up quietly from behind...

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Do you know how to tell a horse's
temperament from the pattern on its pelt?

Horses with {{color id="0"}}spots {{color id="-1"}}are docile and easier to
tame. That makes them easier to catch.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ones that are {{color id="0"}}one color{{color id="-1"}} with no patterns
tend to be wilder and more difficult
to tame.
But they're faster and stronger, and you
can spur them on more!

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Did you know that horses like carrots
and apples?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So if a horse isn't warming up to you,
or if you have trouble catching it,
don't worry...
Unleash the snacks!

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Did you know that horses all have
different abilities?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}First off, there's strength. The more stars
a horse has in that, the less likely it is to
lose its life.
You'll also want to keep an eye on its
speed, as well as its stamina, which is
how many times you can spur it on.
And then there's pull. That tells you how
good the horse is at towing things.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If you attach a harness, your horse can
tow stuff for you. So the more stars it has
in pull, the better!
Lastly, don't forget about your bond with
the horse. If it's too low, your horse might
run away, so...
You gotta show your horse love by riding
it lots, soothing it lots, and feeding it lots!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Good to know, right? I'm kind of an expert
on horses, so if you want to learn more,
