{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I still need to repay you for what you did
back at Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I hope that innkeeper's doing all right.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}He falls asleep every single time you take
your eyes off him. It doesn't inspire much

swift carrots I'd stocked up on in
the village.{{pageBreak}}Once I finish up here, I need to remember
to go shopping in Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}And while I'm there, I might as well make
a stop at that inn.

all right?{{pageBreak}}I don't want people thinking I know you.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I thought I'd go to Kakariko Village for
fortified pumpkins and swift carrots, so of
course it started raining. Just my luck.
