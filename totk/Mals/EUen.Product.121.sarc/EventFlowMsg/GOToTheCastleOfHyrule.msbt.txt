Hm?

Um...

Is that...

label: near_1_3

Must be someone else...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Then...

---
label: talk_1_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Are you saying you came from up THERE?

---
label: talk_1_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}This {{color id="0"}}Rauru{{color id="-1"}} you met...{{delay8}} I think that's what
the {{color id="0"}}first king of Hyrule{{color id="-1"}} was named.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Are they one and the same?{{delay8}} So much of
this doesn't make sense—yet.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I'm certain that mummy you found
under the castle must be related to
{{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk_1_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_00"}}The castle rising up...{{delay8}} The ruins falling
down from the sky...

The mummy must be connected to
it somehow.{{delay15}}

---
label: talk_1_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}And then there's the most important
detail of all. You're sure that you heard
the princess speak to you?
And she gave you a clear message to
find her?

---
label: talk_1_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If that truly was the princess, then that
means she's alive!

Maybe she's trapped beneath the castle
and needs help...

---
label: talk_1_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That settles it. I know you only just
returned, Link...

But I need you to meet with the search
party {{color id="0"}}up by Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}. They've been
searching tirelessly for you two.
The captain in charge of the search is
named {{color id="0"}}Hoz{{color id="-1"}}. Work with him to find the
princess as quickly as you can.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_01"}}I know that mummy may still be lurking
somewhere around there.

Which is concerning, to say the least, but
we have more immediate problems to
deal with right now.
I'm counting on you, Linky!
