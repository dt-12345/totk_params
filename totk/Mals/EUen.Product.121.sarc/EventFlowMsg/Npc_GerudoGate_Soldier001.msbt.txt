{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There has been some abnormal weather
beyond this point... Blazing heat during
the day, freezing cold at night...
It's dangerous to be in the area,
though you can take some precautions
to prepare yourself.
To that end, I am going to ask you a
few questions to make sure you can
handle yourself.
If you aren't able to answer my questions,
I will not let you pass.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Well? Ready?

I'm ready!

label: 0001

I don't think so...

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}OK! Then let's get started...

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Very well.


That cautious attitude will serve you
well in Gerudo Canyon. But the lack of
confidence will not.
Come back and speak with me once
you've located your nerve.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You can cool yourself down temporarily
if you split one of these with a weapon
and stand in the resulting spray.
You may pass, but be careful out there.

label: Quiz_01_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Question number one...

---
label: Quiz_01_01
---
How can you best warm up when
it's cold?

---
label: 1010
---
Vigorously fan myself!

---
label: 1011
---
Pour water on my head!

---
label: 1012
---
Stay near a fire!

---
label: Answer_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Correct... But the first question is the
easiest one.

---
label: Mistake_01_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Maybe you weren't quite listening to
me just then... I'll ask you again—pay
attention this time.

---
label: Mistake_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That is exactly the opposite of what you
should do. Did you answer incorrectly
on purpose?

---
label: Quiz_02_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This second question is a bit more
difficult, so pay attention.

---
label: Quiz_02_01
---
When it is very hot out, where should you
go to cool off?

---
label: 1020
---
A bright, sunny spot!

---
label: 1021
---
A nice, shady spot!

---
label: 1022
---
Upwind, of course!

---
label: Answer_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}That's exactly right. I'm glad that you
appear to have some survival skills...

By the way, dousing yourself in water
would also be a good way to cool off in
the blazing heat. Keep that in mind.

---
label: Mistake_02_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What was that? There was a...{{delay8}}sound...{{delay8}}and
I didn't catch your answer. {{delay15}}Think hard,
then answer the question again.

---
label: Mistake_02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Are you even taking this seriously?{{delay15}}
Try again, and no messing around.

---
label: Quiz_03_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}OK, question number three is very
important and more difficult than the
last two...

---
label: Quiz_03_01
---
What cooking ingredient is effective at
fending off high temperatures?

---
label: 1030
---
Stamella Shroom!

---
label: 1031
---
Sunshroom!

---
label: 1032
---
Chillshroom!

---
label: Answer_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Exactly right! I'm impressed—many have
had trouble with that question...

---
label: Mistake_03_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Not a bad choice, but not the correct
one. Think on it a bit more and try again.

---
label: Mistake_03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Did you get distracted while I was talking?{{delay8}}
Your answer would only help you in low
temperatures...

---
label: Quiz_04_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Last question!

---
label: Quiz_04_01
---
Where in Gerudo Canyon could you go to
avoid being affected by the extreme
temperatures, day or night?

---
label: 1040
---
Into a cave!

---
label: 1041
---
Into the shade!

---
label: 1042
---
Near the ruins!

---
label: Answer_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}All right! You pass! With so much
knowledge at your disposal, I'm sure
you'll be fine out there.
Oh, and you can take this with you too.

---
label: Mistake_04_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ooo, so close. Try again.

---
label: Mistake_04_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}This is the last question, you know. I'll
give you another chance, so really think
before you answer.

---
label: 2000
---
I give up.

---
label: Retire_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Very well.


Come back and speak with me once
you've learned something of surviving...
and found more confidence.

label: Horse_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There has been some abnormal weather
beyond this point... Blazing heat during

It's dangerous to bring a horse into this

If I were you, I'd head north of here to the
{{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}} and leave your horse there.

Hopefully somewhere very far away...

It's simply too dangerous for them beyond
this point.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry, but it's simply too dangerous to

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hmm?{{delay15}} I was going to give you a
splash fruit, but it looks like you're

I'm not sure if this is a fitting substitute,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So...{{delay8}} While I can tell that you are not
