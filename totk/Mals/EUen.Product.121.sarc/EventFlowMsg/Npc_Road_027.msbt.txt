{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Well, well!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I see you're interested in the

{{lowercaseNextWord}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Ah, good! {{delay8}}You have no idea how badly
you were needed. We have a dire staffing
shortage at the moment.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}All the young Gorons are so obsessed
with {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast {{color id="-1"}}that they can't
be bothered to swing a pickax.
I hope {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo {{color id="-1"}}will address the
issue somehow, but in the meantime, we
need all the workers we can get.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I knew it!{{delay8}} I saw you walking around with
President Yunobo, and I just knew!

The workforce has dried up ever since the
younger Gorons got into {{color id="0"}}marbled rock
roast{{color id="-1"}}, so it's nice to see some new blood!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Not only do we deal in fire-resistant

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I see.{{delay8}} Well, I'm sure President Yunobo
must be with you for some other reason.{{pageBreak}}The young Gorons are all so into {{color id="0"}}marbled
rock roast{{color id="-1"}} that they've stopped working.
We need all the hands we can get.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But worker or not, President Yunobo has
a policy that allows anyone to shop here.{{pageBreak}}If you need fire-resistant gear or want to
sell something, come by. Even if nobody
else is working, I will be.

---
label: Talk_38

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Glad to see President Yunobo has finally
taken off that tacky mask.{{pageBreak}}I'm not sure why, but he seems gentler
without it. More like himself.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're looking for {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo{{color id="-1"}},
he's at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo Storage {{color id="-1"}}in front of HQ.

I think he's trying to get more marbled
rock roast.

Oh, or were you here to sell
me something?

No.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Really? {{delay8}}That's too bad.{{pageBreak}}All the young Gorons are so obsessed

working, so we're badly short-staffed.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Hopefully {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo {{color id="-1"}}comes back

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}President Yunobo{{color id="-1"}} is the entrepreneurial
genius who founded {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}He started it as a small mining business to
boost Goron City's development. But then
out of nowhere, he struck it rich!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}YunoboCo {{color id="-1"}}has since become the world's
leading name in mineral mining, with both
Gorons and Hylians on its payroll.
And it all began with one hard-working
Goron. Talk about inspirational!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'll admit {{color id="0"}}President Yunobo {{color id="-1"}}has been
acting a little...{{delay8}}off since {{color id="0"}}marbled rock

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But you can't argue with all he's
accomplished.{{delay8}} The guy made Goron City
what it is today.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Aha! You're not the only one who's
interested in {{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It's the most popular edible rock the

going nuts for it!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The problem is, marbled rock roast can
only be found in really, and I mean
REALLY, tough bedrock.
{{color id="0"}}President Yunobo{{color id="-1"}} is the only one who
can mine through such tough stone, so
our supply of the stuff is pretty scarce.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, not for nothing—don't be fooled by

Unless you're dying to know how a

The flamebreaker armor I sell would more
