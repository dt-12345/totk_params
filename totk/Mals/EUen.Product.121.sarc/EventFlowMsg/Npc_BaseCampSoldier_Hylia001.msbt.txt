investigate the gloom...
And then the castle rose into the sky, and
everyone's been so worried about what
happened to you both!{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}} has nearly worn herself out trying

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Right after Hyrule Castle rose into

Well, it's the same way we've all felt

Lookout Landing?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This place is known as Lookout Landing.


When the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} began to seep up from
under Hyrule Castle, {{color id="0"}}Purah{{color id="-1"}} started
observing it from here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But now we're all here looking out for

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}We don't see a lot of monsters right
around here, but we do have two of
those strange {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}} nearby.
One's {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} of here. The other's off to

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The Gerudo heard about what happened

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}All the Gerudo here at {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}...
They came because of you.

You inspired an entire people to spring
into action. Not many can do that.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Though I know someone else who does—
Princess Zelda. *sigh*

Where do you think she is? Still in that

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}All these Gerudo are really making my

spring into action... You or the princess.
