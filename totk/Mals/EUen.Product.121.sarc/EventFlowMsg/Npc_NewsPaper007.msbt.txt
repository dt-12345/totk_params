{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}"Seaside Village Attacked by Pirates.{{pageBreak}}"Pirates attacked and destroyed the once
lovely Lurelin Village. Villagers have

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Look how far we've come as a society!
I can get my fill of world affairs without
ever going on a single adventure.

I even hear tales of giant horses and some
kind of horse god!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I did hear that horse god has gone
elsewhere for now. But stuff like that
makes great news stories!
