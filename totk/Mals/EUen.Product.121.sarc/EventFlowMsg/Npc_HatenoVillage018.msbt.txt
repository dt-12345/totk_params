{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} owned this house, back
before the Upheaval.{{pageBreak}}She believed that the children of Hateno
Village were important to Hyrule. So she
founded a school in our village.{{delay15}}
She lived here in this village to oversee
construction of the schoolhouse.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I don't really know where she went, but
I'm sure our princess will come back.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I keep the place tidy so it's ready for her
whenever she returns.{{pageBreak}}The princess was never one to turn
anyone away from here, so you're free
to come and go as you please too.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The princess was never one to turn away
anyone who wanted to be here.{{pageBreak}}That's why it would always get crowded
with kids as soon as lessons were over.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm looking forward to the day when she
comes back with a smile on her face, as if
none of this ever happened.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sorry, but not now.{{pageBreak}}My husband told me he's on his way to
Ventest Clothing, and I have to be ready
for what comes after.{{pageBreak}}Never heard of it? The clothing shop right
near the village entrance?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}But no, I really can't get into it right now.
Deep breaths, Clavia.{{pageBreak}}There'll be time to entertain guests later.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}My husband is the living end. If only he
weren't so pigheaded!{{pageBreak}}I want to support him, of course, but
suppose he does win the election under
these circumstances. What then?{{pageBreak}}It wouldn't change or improve anything.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You ought to be my guest, and instead
I end up asking you for favors. Sorry
about that.{{pageBreak}}But you were a huge help. Thank you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If only that man could be more forthright.
He takes everything so seriously that he
sometimes doesn't know how to open up.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}No one knows him like me, so it's up to
me to give him my support.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! I've been wanting to thank you for
how the mayoral election turned out!{{pageBreak}}My husband and Cece have found a way
to put their differences aside.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Though if I know them, they'll be fighting
again soon enough. They're too much
alike to stay civil for long.{{pageBreak}}Well, when the time comes, I think Sophie
and I know how to handle them now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you're looking for my husband, he's
busy with his new vegetable scheme in
the field at Nack's place.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It doesn't seem to be going very well.{{delay8}}
If it's not one thing with that man, it's
another, I swear.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So you ended up helping him again, eh?{{pageBreak}}I'll take anything that lightens the load
on my husband. Honestly, thank you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The villagers have to work together, and
that includes my husband with his {{color id="0"}}sun
pumpkins{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}He seems eager to work with Cece to
keep our town booming, I'll give him that.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I do want to show you around the village,
and it's true that my work is done now.{{pageBreak}}But it's gotten dark and I need to get
home. {{delay8}}Have you found a place to stay?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you haven't, you should get a room at
{{color id="0"}}Ton Pu Inn{{color id="-1"}} on the main road.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's gotten dark and I need to go

this house.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you have nowhere else to stay? I can't
