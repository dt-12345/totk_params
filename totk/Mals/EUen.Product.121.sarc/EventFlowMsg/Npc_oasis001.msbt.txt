{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}This is what I get for being so focused on gathering
materials that I don't even notice I've wandered
into a {{color id="0"}}Molduga's territory{{color id="-1"}}.
I'm safe up here on the high ground, but since
sound will attract it, I can't get down...

Hmph, and of course I don't have anything to
distract it with either.

And if I fall down from here... Well, {{color id="0"}}Molduga will

You must be incredibly strong!

This must be fate. Don't you agree?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh! {{delay8}}I'm {{color id="0"}}Isha{{color id="-1"}}. I run the jewelry shop in
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}.

I came all the way out here to try to find
some special things to add to jewelry...

But before I knew it, {{delay8}}I somehow wandered
right into that Molduga's territory. If you
hadn't shown up, I'd have been its lunch.

If you come visit my shop in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}},
there is {{color id="0"}}something special{{color id="-1"}} that I can craft
for you.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Oh, wait.{{delay8}} He's a voe, so he can't even get into town,

I knew I'd see you again, of course, but I

And even more surprising... {{delay8}}Not only do
you mean something special to me for

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I know exactly how to thank you for your

You see, there's {{color id="0"}}something special{{color id="-1"}} that
only certain people are able to craft...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But there's no way I could do such

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Well? What do you think of my specially

I made them to be used, not to gather
dust, so it would mean a lot to me if you
kept them close.
