{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}I...went for a walk, and now I can't get
back to Korok Forest...

And my friends I was walking with jumped
into this {{color id="0"}}weird hole{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}They said we might be able to go back to
the forest through the hole, but...do you
think it's safe?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Since the {{color id="0"}}Lost Woods{{color id="-1"}} returned to normal,
I was able to make it back!

Korok Forest is so peaceful, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}By the way... {{delay8}}Have you seen a Korok
named Oaki? {{delay8}}Oh! {{delay8}}You don't even know
who Oaki is, huh?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmmm. I wonder where he went.{{delay8}}
Maybe he's hiding in the Great Deku
Tree's mouth...
If you wanna know where his mouth is,
it's right above the Spore Store.
