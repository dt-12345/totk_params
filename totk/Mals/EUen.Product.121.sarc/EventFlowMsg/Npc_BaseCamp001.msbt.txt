{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thanks for bringing me that ingredient.
You really saved my bacon.

Now I can give the search party plenty

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh, hey there! {{delay8}}I see I'm not the only one
who thought it was worth the trek to
come here.
You must really appreciate good cooking
if you're willing to sneak into the Hyrule
Castle dining hall.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This place is loaded with recipes I
couldn't have dreamed up myself!
It's all so inspiring.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I came all this way to find a special
recipe so I can treat everyone back
at Lookout Landing.
Nothing lifts the spirits like delicious food!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So you take an oil jar and then you take some
Hylian rice... And add meat. Looks like any ol'
meat will do the trick.
Next, add in a bird egg and sauté it up. I see, I see.
Maybe I'll whip up this beauty later.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So you take an oil jar and Hylian rice... And then
you add in meat and a bird egg?

Darn it. Hungry again. Better hurry up and try this
one out soon.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You need to cook a dish while you still
remember the recipe. That way you can
commit it to memory!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Uh... The recipe I saw on that poster... Lessee...
It was Hylian rice, meat, a bird egg, and... {{delay15}}Uh.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wanted to make the recipe I saw
on the poster, but I can't remember
the ingredients.
Actually, I'd memorized them, but
one can never be too certain! Best
to double-check...
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I just want to be sure—that's all!
I definitely didn't forget!
