We must get to that lab...

---
label: Talk_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I knew you'd be dying of curiosity over
the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}.

Follow me, would ya?

---
label: Talk_1085
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Great job getting the picture of the {{color id="0"}}figure{{color id="-1"}}
that Josha was looking for! She was pretty
happy to see that statue.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And I was thrilled to show you how to
use the {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}. Inspired, even!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The Purah Pad has even more potential
functions, you know.

---
label: Talk_1076
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I really appreciate you fixing up my
balloon.{{delay8}} Ultra thanks!

That "Autobuild" thing is pretty
darn amazing.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmm, I should have a good think about
all the practical uses of that someday.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! That reminds me...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_1086
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, you!{{delay8}} Listen up!


Now that Josha has solved the mystery
of that slate...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I can return to the {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad Laboratory{{color id="-1"}}
in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}!

If you go there, I can make even more 
improvements to your Purah Pad, starting
with the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You'll find the lab in East Necluda, off in
the southeast corner of Hyrule. On its
far side is Hateno Village.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Go a bit farther than that and you'll see a
mighty peculiar place. Don't let the looks
fool you. It's a cutting-edge lab!

---
label: Talk_1073
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Listen up! Big update here.


Your Purah Pad can be equipped with a
{{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}that {{color id="0"}}detects shrines{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_1077
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_1084
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Come on!{{delay8}} Act more impressed!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm the first one in ALL of Hyrule who
noticed the shrines after the Upheaval.
So I created a {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}to detect them!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Only thing is, I can't set it up here at
Lookout Landing.

It'd be nearly impossible unless I'm
at the {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad Research Lab {{color id="-1"}}in
{{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.

label: 0018
---
Purah Pad Research Lab?

---
label: Talk_1074
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}That's right. It's a lab dedicated to the
enhancement of the Purah Pad, which
Purah and I developed.
Once I'm in that lab, and you join me
there, I can further {{color id="0"}}improve {{color id="-1"}}your Purah
Pad, {{color id="0"}}starting with the sensor{{color id="-1"}}.
You'll find the lab in {{color id="0"}}East Necluda{{color id="-1"}}, off in
the southeast corner of Hyrule. On its
far side is {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.
Go a bit farther than that and you'll see
a mighty peculiar place. Don't let the
looks fool you. It's a cutting-edge lab!

---
label: Talk_1081
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But for now, Josha's investigations are
my main priority.{{delay8}}

So until she gets further along, I'll be
staying here for a while.

---
label: Talk_1075
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The Purah Pad will prove to be absolutely
essential for finding the princess! I'm sure
of it.
So, you'll want the pad upgraded to be
of even MORE use, starting with that
{{color id="0"}}shrine sensor{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But I can't do it at Lookout Landing,
not with the meager equipment we have
on hand here.
Even with my genius for these things,
I need to upgrade it at the {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad
Research Lab {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 0020
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_1083
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm interested in where Josha's research
is headed.

So I'll stay here a bit longer.

---
label: Talk_1082
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}People have been saying the princess has
been sighted in the castle, but I have a
hard time believing that.
Anyway, Purah's on top of that. She'll be
looking into the castle herself.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I intend to look for clues regarding the
princess using my OWN methods.

---
label: Talk_1078
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All right, I'm going to head over there.
I'll be waiting for you to arrive.

See you in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}! Don't keep
me waiting!

---
label: Near2003
---
Welcome!

---
label: Near2004
---
A rainy welcome to you!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, you!


The Purah Pad Laboratory is ready for us
to do some great things together! First,
let's get that {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}up and running.
Come on, let me see that {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad{{color id="-1"}}.
This will only take a moment.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}One{{delay8}}-and-a-two{{delay8}}-and-a-three{{delay8}}-and-a-four!

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Done-zo!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now this {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}will make a sound if
there are {{color id="0"}}shrines{{color id="-1"}} near you.

---
label: Talk_82
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All right! Now that I've installed that
{{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}} for you...

How about you walk around the lab to
test out how it reacts?

---
label: Talk_78
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK, that wraps up my chatting about it.{{delay8}}
Try testing out the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} That's odd.{{delay15}}


The {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}reacts {{color id="0"}}when you're moving
toward a shrine{{color id="-1"}}...

There's a shrine in the cave at the
bottom of this hill. But the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}} isn't
reacting to it whatsoever!

---
label: Talk_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}What?! {{delay8}}You already found it?


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'd expect nothing less from you.


That {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}will still be invaluable.
It's the product of my brilliance, after all.
I'd expect nothing less from ME.

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What's this? The {{color id="0"}}sensor {{color id="-1"}}that I installed
on your Purah Pad is reacting to
something—right here and now!
It reacts {{color id="0"}}when you're moving toward
a shrine{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}} must be detecting a shrine
down the slope in front of the lab. Is there
really one THAT close by?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There must be, because my creations
are perfect.{{delay15}} Unless they get broken in
some way.
Now, why don't you go check {{color id="0"}}down the
slope{{color id="-1"}}, in the direction that the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}
was indicating?

---
label: Near2005
---
It should be around here.

---
label: Near2002
---
Did you find the shrine?

---
label: Talk_75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}My design of the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}} is beyond
perfection!{{pageBreak}}Just listen to its sounds and you'll find
your way to that nearby {{color id="0"}}shrine{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_79
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}WHAT?! {{delay8}}You found it?


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'd expect nothing less from you.


Anyway, how about that {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}Handy,
huh? I'd expect nothing less from ME!

---
label: Talk_83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Now you begin to see the true potential
of the Purah Pad!

But I'm nowhere NEAR done yet.
I created new features for that device
while I was waiting here for you.
Yes! I whipped up some {{color id="0"}}prototypes{{color id="-1"}} of
these extra features and can get them
on your Purah Pad at any time!
That is, with some help from you,
getting some final data I need in order
to activate them perfectly.
Let's talk if you want those upgrades.
Enjoy that {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}—a taste of great
things to come. {{delay8}}Until then!

---
label: Talk_76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When the {{color id="0"}}Shrine Sensor{{color id="-1"}} responds, then
there should be a shrine nearby.

More precisely, it'll react {{color id="0"}}when you are
moving in the direction of a shrine{{color id="-1"}}.

If it's not reacting stably, try {{color id="0"}}changing the
direction you're facing{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey, you! How long you gonna make
me wait?

---
label: Talk_84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What's the problem? Do you need help
with the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It'll react {{color id="0"}}when you're moving toward a
shrine{{color id="-1"}}. The more strongly, the more
you're pointed in the right direction!
So, if it's not responding much—or at
all—try {{color id="0"}}moving in another direction{{color id="-1"}}.

It seemed to go off more when you were
pointed toward a section {{color id="0"}}of the slope
outside{{color id="-1"}}. Try going right down there!

---
label: Talk_77
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hey, you. Where are you going?

---
label: Talk_85
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}We need to finish {{color id="0"}}testing{{color id="-1"}} your new
{{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}. Come back here, will ya?!

---
label: Talk_87
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're still testing that {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}, so hold off
on the rushing around for now.{{pageBreak}}Just {{color id="0"}}walk {{color id="-1"}}in the direction you're moving{{color id="0"}}
when you hear the sensor react{{color id="-1"}}.
