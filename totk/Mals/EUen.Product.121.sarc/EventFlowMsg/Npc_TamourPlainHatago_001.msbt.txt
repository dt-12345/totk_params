Blegh. Rain.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good morning.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Why, hello there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good evening.

label: Talk11

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I try to keep my attitude sunny, even
when the weather isn't.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Sir, aren't you going to take shelter?
You'll get soaked out in this rain!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hm. {{delay8}}I could have sworn I heard a Cucco
crying out in the distance...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Huh?! {{delay8}}Oh gosh! {{delay8}}I'm so sorry! I was
counting the sheep and ended up
dozing off.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Welcome to South Baaa-kkala Stable!{{delay15}}

label: Talk30

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Just kidding! {{delay8}}A bit of sheep humor
for you.{{delay8}} The place you're at is actually
called South Akkala Stable.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Since we've always had so many sheep
here, some visitors started calling us the
"sheep stable."
So I thought, why not embrace it?
And I started taking extra good care
of the sheep.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Before I knew it, even more showed up!
It was like a woolly invasion!

But no complaints from me. I think they're
just adorable!

label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sadly, while I was busy making this place
a ewe-topia, our Cucco went missing.

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That poor, sweet bird always {{color id="0"}}hated being
alone{{color id="-1"}}. She {{color id="0"}}wouldn't lay eggs {{color id="-1"}}unless one
of us was nearby.{{delay15}}
I hate to think how scared and lonely she
must be...

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Sometimes I swear I hear a sad squawking sound
and it {{color id="0"}}wakes me up{{color id="-1"}}... But that must be a dream...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm so worried about our missing Cucco.{{delay8}}
She always hated being alone.

She {{color id="0"}}wouldn't lay eggs {{color id="-1"}}when she was
{{color id="0"}}by herself{{color id="-1"}}, so I made a point to spend
quality time with her every day.
But I got so preoccupied with the sheep,
it slipped my mind, and now...

I just wish she had a {{color id="0"}}friend{{color id="-1"}} to keep
her company.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sometimes I swear I hear a sad squawking sound
and it {{color id="0"}}wakes me up{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} But that must be a dream...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}For a while, I'd wake up to a sad
squawking sound in the distance, almost
as if she was crying out for a friend.
But lately the squawking sounds {{delay8}}happier!


{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I know I probably dreamed all of that.
But it comforts me to think that wherever
she is, she's not alone anymore.

label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}At this point, I might have to go and see
the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}. He's rumored to be
at {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the northeast.
I know he's not the god of birds, but still,
maybe he has the power to protect my
dear Cucco.

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know, there's another stable to the
{{color id="0"}}northeast {{color id="-1"}}called {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

There's a so-called {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}} around
there who's said to be quite powerful.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I bet if I ask nicely, he'll watch over my
beloved Cucco for me!

I'm going to go there next chance I get
and ask him.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Cuccos aren't horses, obviously... {{delay8}}But they are both
animals, so I'm sure he can still help... {{delay15}}Right?{{size value="100"}}
