A voe?!

He's gone...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You...{{delay8}} You're a real voe, right?

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}I know I asked you already, but...{{delay8}}
You're a real voe?

label: 0006

I am, indeed.

Nope.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}R-really? {{delay8}}Are you telling the truth?{{delay8}}
I learned in the {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}} that all voe like
to lie though...

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I knew it! I knew you wouldn't answer
honestly! {{color id="0"}}Class{{color id="-1"}} taught me that all voe like
to lie!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Kalani! You'd better not be talking
to that voe!

Why don't you follow Makure's example?
Be more like your sister!

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's fine! I haven't made eye contact, so
it's all fine!

label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What does that even... Ugh.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, voe. We Gerudo have a saying.


"For young vai, speaking with a voe will
only invite misfortune!"

{{anim type="Think"}}Vai learn that at an early age, so even
though you're allowed to be here, please
leave the young ones be.

---
label: talk0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh... Of all the things you could've
learned to do at your age, why is arguing
the one you've taken such a liking to?

---
label: near0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's a voe!

label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Ah! We made eye contact! No, no, it's
fine! We'll just pretend we didn't!

Gotta be sneaky...

---
label: near0010
---
Can't let her see me...

---
label: talk0018
---
{{anim type="Think"}}Honestly, I wouldn't mind talking with
you, but then my vaba would get mad
at me...
{{anim type="Think"}}Besides, I learned that it's best to know
how voe live before really talking to them.

Ms. Ashai talked about that in the {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}}.
So that means it's still too soon to talk
to voe!

---
label: talk0022

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Eek! A voe!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hey, hold on a minute! {{delay15}}You may have
the chief's favor, but...

I'd rather you didn't speak to my
students, OK?

If you have questions about this class,
talk to me.

So sleepy...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That huge picture that appeared on the

at night.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}Makure... {{delay8}}You can't follow me...{{delay8}} You're
not old enough for class...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}I'm gonna be an amazing vai... {{delay8}}Just you
wait and see...

Vasaaq!

label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}My vaba said it was OK if I talked to you.


That means I don't have to hide my face
anymore! Yay!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But also, Ms. Ashai said that it's still not OK, so
maybe we can keep this a secret?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0033
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ms. Ashai says it's still not OK to chat with voe...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hey, hold on a minute! {{delay15}}You may have
really helped the town, but...

I'd rather you didn't speak to my

If you have questions about this class,
talk to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}A lot of the guards have been adding little
things to their weapons lately, but do you
know who started the trend?
It was my vaba!


Even Buliara, who left for {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}
already, was super interested in the idea!

I guess she had folks trying all different
kinds of materials on their weapons!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I'm really proud of my vaba!

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Thank you for buying sooo much!


Are you going to try attaching Chuchu
jelly to a weapon?

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Sorry, I'm kind of in a hurry right now...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Whenever I go to the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}} class{{color id="-1"}},
I have to sneak off without my little sister,
Makure, noticing.
If I don't, she'll follow me to the class.
I usually slip away when she's busy with
the shop...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, if you want to talk, find me after
class is over. {{delay15}}Sav'orq!

---
label: talk0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If my little sister, Makure, spots me, she
always follows me to the "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}"{{color id="0"}}
class{{color id="-1"}}.
I try to sneak away for lessons when she's
helping at the shop...

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That's why I need to get back there now
though! I don't want her to realize I've
been gone!
