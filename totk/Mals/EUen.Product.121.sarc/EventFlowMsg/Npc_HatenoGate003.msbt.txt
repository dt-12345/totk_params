{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! {{delay15}}You're the guy who rescued us back
at Gerudo Canyon, right?{{delay15}} You are!

Fancy meeting you here!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}After everything that went down, my
friends were all adventured out, and we
decided to go our separate ways.
I was wondering what to do next when
I stumbled onto this troupe...{{delay8}}and my
life was forever changed!
The way they play their instruments is
incredible! Imagine traveling from place to
place just to perform for people.

Seeing them happy makes me happy too.{{pageBreak}}They travel from place to place just to
spread joy to other people... {{delay8}}Maybe
there's something to that.
