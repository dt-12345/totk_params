*sniff*... Master Kohga...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Even compared to the others, this branch
is REALLY well hidden. {{delay15}}And Link still
found us and messed things up!

---
label: Talk_002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I admit, he did hurt us by setting our
tailors free.

But no matter. We will rebuild. Remember,
these branches exist to advance Master
Kohga's control over the Depths.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Besides, it's better he raid our branches
than attack our hideout and try to take
our {{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeesh, can you imagine a zap-proof Link?
What a nightmare.

---
label: Talk_004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't worry. Even if Link makes it to the
hideout, there's an army of our best guys
waiting for him. He won't stand a chance.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm sorry, hold that thought for a second.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What do you want? A Yiga's supposed to
eavesdrop on enemy conversations. It's
just plain rude to do it to your allies!

---
label: Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Does the {{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}} really work?


I mean, it's metal, right? How's lightning
supposed to bounce off of it? I figured the
research team was playing a joke on me!

---
label: Talk_005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's no joke. The helm is a very special
piece of equipment. From what I hear, you
don't choose to wear it, it chooses you.

---
label: Talk_008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Didn't I tell you to stop
eavesdropping?!

---
label: Talk_007_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Could you get lost already?! This is a
two-person conversation, so stop trying to
listen in! Seriously, what's your...{{delay15}}deal...
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Wait. {{delay15}}That nobleness to your bearing...
Could it be? Are you that Yiga who just
became a blademaster?!
{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Please forgive me for my rudeness!

---
label: Talk_007_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Could you get lost?!{{delay15}} This is a private
conversation, so get your fancy helmet...{{delay8}}
out of here...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}That's...{{delay15}}the Li...{{delay8}}Lightning Helm!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}But that would mean...{{delay8}}y-you're the
new blademaster!{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Please forgive my rudeness.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Er, excuse me. I'm nervous enough talking
to one blademaster, let alone two. I beg
you, please, stop listening in for a while.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_008_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Er, excuse me. That helm's so...{{delay8}}dauntingly
impressive, it's kind of hard to chat in
front of you...{{delay8}}
