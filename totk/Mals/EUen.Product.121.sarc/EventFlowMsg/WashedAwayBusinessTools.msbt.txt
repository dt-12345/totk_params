{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh, {{delay8}}you're Link! Well, here you are,
our hero!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I returned to my village when I heard that
the pirates disappeared. Who'd think I'd
bump into you here?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Well, unfortunately, I don't really have

Something about giving it a name really
makes it more important to me.

Here, take this. It's the least I can do
after you helped me reopen my store!

label: Talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}This is a very rare thing you can't
buy anywhere!

I don't sell star fragments either, but
my shop does try to stock rarer things
you can't find elsewhere if I can.
I take pride in my goods, so please come
back to shop whenever you like!

anything else.

I thought I'd give you a {{color id="0"}}star fragment{{color id="-1"}}
as thanks, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's OK! I'll hold on to it until you've
made room for it among your things.

I don't want to leave you empty-handed
after you helped me reopen the general
