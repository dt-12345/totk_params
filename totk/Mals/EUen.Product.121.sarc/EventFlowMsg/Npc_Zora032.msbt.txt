Blech...

{{anim type="Ease"}}Now I must...report back to the
domain...{{delay8}}but first, I need just a
small break...{{delay8}} Blech!

My gills are clear!

---
label: talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}For some reason, the sludge plaguing my
gills has disappeared! I feel incredible!

Fantastic!{{delay8}} Three cheers for good health!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There is no longer a need to investigate
the sludge, and so I can finally return
home to the domain!

---
label: near1003
---
Fantastic!

label: talk1005

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Link! So you are responsible for the
sludge disappearing! I might have
guessed as much.{{delay15}} Thank you, good sir!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As captain of the guard, it is my duty to
reflect upon the awful tragedies endured
by the domain because of the Upheaval...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}From this moment forward, I shall forever
steel myself in service of His Majesty,
King Sidon!
I shall do so faithfully, just as my father,
Seggin, served the Exalted Dorephan!

---
label: talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}From this moment onward, I must rise to
the task of serving King Sidon! As captain,
it is the very least I can do.
I shall not falter as I follow in the
footsteps of my father, Seggin, who
dutifully served the Exalted Dorephan!

Hmm...

---

Safety check!

label: talk1020

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Link!{{delay8}} If you are seeking an audience with
His Majesty, King Sidon, please proceed
to the throne room.
The Exalted Dorephan is with him as well.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you seek an audience with King Sidon,
please proceed to the throne room.{{delay15}}
The Exalted Dorephan is there as well.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I heard you were responsible for cleaning
up this statue, Link.

We are truly lucky that you were here
to help us out of this mess.

However, we must be prepared to respond
to the most dangerous of dangers and the
worst-case scenarios on our own!

---
label: talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}I fear we are overreliant on King
Sidon's protection, and yours as well.

Perhaps I will prepare a crisis-response
handbook for our soldiers. They must be
ready for anything, after all...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I suppose this place is so well loved
because of the fine fish it sells!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I saw Cleff, the owner, smirking once.
{{delay8}}He was mumbling something like...{{delay8}} 
"Mmm, just a dab of crab!"
He was chewing a crab whole as he
spoke. It made me think...perhaps he
ought to retire soon.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It looked like his mouth was being torn to
shreds by the spiky shell. It was...quite
disturbing. {{delay15}}I'll stick with fish, thank you.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I saw Cleff, the owner, mumbling some
oddness like, "Mmm, just a dab of crab!"

I do not want to know what that was all
about, but as far as I am concerned,
nothing beats a nice, savory fish.

label: talk1023

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now that the sludge is gone, tourists have
finally started coming here again.

Aside from you, Link, our first visitor was
the traveling merchant Mr. Sasan.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}He seemed to have a connection with
Kayden's family over at the inn.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}As captain of the guard, it is my job to
preserve the peace{{delay8}} so that visitors like
him can come and go in safety.

---
label: talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}From this moment onward, I must do my
utmost to keep the peace around here!
Such is my duty as captain.
I shall ensure that any and all travelers
visiting Zora's Domain can make their way
around here without fear of injury.

---
label: talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Making the rounds like this is a basic
principle of security!

I walk around prepared to respond
to an unexpected incident at a
moment's notice.
An incident like...{{delay8}}something suddenly
falling from the sky and hitting me on
the head!
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Next time, I will avoid such a thing
happening without question!

{{size value="80"}}The captain of the guard must never be the first
to fall!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I always expect the unexpected! That is
the trick, you see!

No matter what comes raining down,
be it a spear or sludge, next time I will
dodge the culprit with all due haste!
{{size value="80"}}As the captain, I must succeed in any challenge
that chances upon me!{{size value="100"}}

So much sludge...

---
label: talk1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Well, now!{{delay8}} Did you come traveling here
through the sludge?!

As for me, I am risking my life looking
around here to help with our research
on the sludge.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Unfortunately, I still have not figured
anything out...

---
label: talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}If I just...{{delay15}}keep looking around, perhaps I
will figure out something that could be
of use...
As captain of the Zora's Domain guard,
I must not return home empty-handed!
