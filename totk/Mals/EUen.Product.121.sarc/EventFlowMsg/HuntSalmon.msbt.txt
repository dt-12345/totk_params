{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Here is my tale...{{delay8}} When my dear wife, Mei,
went out fishing, she was singing this
mysterious song to herself...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Humming_00"}}♪I found a floating place,{{delay8}} where I'll catch
fish with grace!{{delay15}} A hop and a skip to a
great fishing trip!♪
And with that, my wife hopped and
skipped over to the bridge in the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}
of the domain.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}At the time, I paid it no heed. She is given
to songs of fancy. But her absence has
started to weigh heavily on my mind.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}A floating place... A hop and skip away...


I have never heard of such a place.


{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}My wife is the type to rush off in a fit of
excitement. I am worried that she will do
something rash.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Oh, my beloved Mei... I dearly hope that
she has not gone somewhere dangerous.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Apologies for asking such a strange

Mei...

label: talk0033

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}My wife, Mei, has always been the sort to
act decisively. She never needed any help
in that area.
Yet she was further inspired by King
Sidon's succession.{{delay8}} She vowed to
"take the initiative just like our king."
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}She was racing all over from the moment
she awoke.{{delay8}} I feel it is likely she found her
"floating place" and "hopped" there.
I...do not truly understand what I am
saying either,{{delay8}} but one thing is for sure.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}My dear wife's impulsive actions can
sometimes cause a great deal of trouble
for our family.
*sigh*{{delay8}} Where could Mei be?{{delay8}} If only I had
tried to stop her before she crossed the
{{color id="0"}}eastern{{color id="-1"}} bridge...

scolded herself terribly over this on the
