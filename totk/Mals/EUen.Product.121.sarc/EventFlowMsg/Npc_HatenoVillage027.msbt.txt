A-Zoom?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The truth is, my identity as the general-

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm really A-Zoom, the big-time hero!{{pageBreak}}It's my job to protect the school and the

Find any bad guys?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ummm, let's see... Teebo's house is the 
closest one, and I haven't seen any bad
guys there.{{pageBreak}}Teebo's dad was the gatekeeper here,
but he went to help out at a place called
Lookout Landing.{{pageBreak}}So now Teebo and his mom take turns
guarding the gate.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh, my mom was talking about Teebo's
mom though. What was it she said?{{pageBreak}}Something like, "It's a real shame she's

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Did you know bad guys took over old man
Robbie's lab in northeast Akkala?{{pageBreak}}There's also a {{color id="0"}}research lab {{color id="-1"}}at the top of
the hill here, but it's too far away for me
to patrol every day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What if the bad guys find out about
A-Zoom's blind spots and take it over?
You gotta keep my secret!

label: Talk_6018

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Um, let's see. It doesn't look like the bad
guys are interested in Ms. Zelda's house
on the edge of town.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Mom said Ms. Zelda might not ever come
back. But I still believe!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}A big reason A-Zoom keeps an eye on
things is so Ms. Zelda can come back
anytime she wants!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm, let's see. Old lady Uma was fussing
over what to plant in the field...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}No bad guys spotted that way though!{{pageBreak}}That old lady grows the best veggies in
Hateno Village, y'know.{{pageBreak}}That's what my mom says, so it must
be true!

---
label: Talk_6019

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm, let's see. {{delay15}}One spot I've been
watching is old man Nack's field at
the town entrance.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Haven't seen any bad guys there so far!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}My mom says Nack is the most
fashionable farmer in the village.{{pageBreak}}But he hangs out a lot with Reede, the
village mayor, and that guy doesn't care
about fashion at all. So I don't get it.
