A man?!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You must be that man—I mean voe—that
everyone is talking about! It's so unusual
to see a man here...
So you really did get special permission
to be in here, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}All the same, you should still be on your
best behavior.

You wouldn't want to end up thrown out
or in jail. That's what normally happens
when men come here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I don't think you have anything to
worry about as long as you behave.

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Anyway, this is important! Since you've
been allowed in town, you absolutely have
to try the {{color id="0"}}spa plan{{color id="-1"}} at Hotel Oasis!
The owner of the place, {{color id="0"}}Romah{{color id="-1"}}, has a
special technique that is all the rage.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Originally I was just another customer
coming here to relax, but I got hooked...

Now I work here as an assistant, ha!

---
label: talk0025

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're back!


It's always kind of exciting to see you,
what with men not really allowed to come
into Gerudo Town!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, you should be careful not to
cause any problems...{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0026

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Otherwise, you might end up like that guy...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I'm sure as long as you behave
yourself, you won't run into any trouble.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Anyway! Since you're here already, you
absolutely need to try {{color id="0"}}Romah's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}spa plan{{color id="-1"}}!

And if you don't have enough to pay for it
right now, you can always try the spa plan
that {{color id="0"}}Olu{{color id="-1"}}, her apprentice, offers.
{{size value="80"}}But, well... Just keep in mind that it's discounted for
a reason. I don't think the results are guaranteed...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you tried either of the spa plans?


{{color id="0"}}Romah{{color id="-1"}}'s speaks for itself, but {{color id="0"}}Olu{{color id="-1"}}'s is
worth checking out too, if you're a bit
light on rupees. You can't go wrong!

Romah?

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The owner of Hotel Oasis, {{color id="0"}}Romah{{color id="-1"}}, is
known by vai the world over!

Her special relaxation technique can not
only improve the condition of your skin...

but it is known to {{color id="0"}}awaken dormant powers{{color id="-1"}}
inside you for a time, as well!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Originally I was just another customer
coming here to relax, but I got hooked...

Now I work here as an assistant, ha!


{{color id="0"}}Olu{{color id="-1"}}'s spa plan is pretty good too, but
in the end...{{color id="0"}}Romah{{color id="-1"}}'s is by far the more
popular one!

---
label: 0001
---
Olu?

---
label: talk0017
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Olu{{color id="-1"}} is apprenticing under {{color id="0"}}Romah{{color id="-1"}}.


She's the only vai who has ever had
the opportunity to inherit Romah's
special technique.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But...she's still learning. The effects of
her spa plan are a bit less reliable, you
might say.
The price is more affordable though!
If you're in the mood to take a chance,
you should give it a shot!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's really rare for a voe to be able to

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's really rare for a voe to be able to

You should absolutely check out Romah's

anything like it anywhere else!
Try it! Try it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The spa plan that {{color id="0"}}Olu{{color id="-1"}} offers is reasonably
priced and a good option too!

{{size value="80"}}But, well... Just keep in mind that it's discounted for
