{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}I'll ask you again.

Between that tasteless Gloomdredger
over there and this HOVERDOOM MK.3...{{pageBreak}}which do you think is more beautiful?

---
label: 0000
---
The Gloomdredger.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}It's all spike and no substance! And so
are you! This conversation's over.{{delay15}} Go on!
Get out of here!

label: 0001
---
The HOVERDOOM, duh.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Heh, easiest question you'll ever answer.


This HOVERDOOM MK.3 is a whole
different beast from that all-show
number over there.
Simplicity with a dash of recklessness...
Now that's how you craft a dangerous
weapon.

label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughBad"}}{{size value="80"}}How about it? You've a dash of recklessness
yourself, so I'll sell you one brand-new for
{{color id="0"}}99 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
Just don't let it slip that I sold one to some
rank-and-file Yiga member, OK? That'd lead
to some awkward conversations.
You good if we do the handover outside?{{size value="100"}}

Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I picked the wrong person to ask.

Let's do this.

---
label: 0003
---
I'll pass.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry"}}Huh? I'm not interested in people who
don't have money. This conversation's
over.{{delay15}} Go on! Get out of here!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Looks like you've got {{color id="0"}}99 rupees{{color id="-1"}}, all right.{{delay15}}
Heh,{{delay8}} I'm glad someone around here
recognizes quality.

label: Talk_04
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We're in the public eye here. Come on... Pretend
like you don't know me, and follow me out...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Brand new, complete with a steering stick.{{delay8}}
Take it.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Not another move!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'll give you points for being interested in
my HOVERDOOM MK.3, but...{{delay15}}

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}No touching it without my OK!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Haha. Just can't keep yourself away from
my HOVERDOOM MK.3, can you?

You really do have impeccable taste.
{{delay15}}However...

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}I told you not to touch it!{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_11_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughBad"}}{{size value="80"}}So, how about it? You've a dash of recklessness
yourself, so I'll sell you one brand-new for
{{color id="0"}}99 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
Hold on...{{delay15}}you're a blademaster.


OK... {{delay15}}Yeah. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Help me out, and I'll give you a HOVERDOOM MK.3
for {{color id="0"}}50 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
But let's keep it between us, huh? If people hear I'm
just letting these go, it wouldn't be good for me.

You good if we do the handover outside?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yep, that's {{color id="0"}}50 rupees{{color id="-1"}}, all right. {{delay15}}
Heh, I'm glad someone around
here recognizes quality.
Just remember, I might be looking for
some back-scratching in the future...
