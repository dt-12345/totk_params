{{color id="0"}}Xalis {{color id="-1"}}is leading the Ring Ruins investigation, so

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The wind suddenly picked up. Is there something
going on nearby? I don't know what could cause it.

Though I did once hear a legend that there are

No, no. I mustn't let a little wind spook me.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I'm a {{color id="0"}}specialist in gloom{{color id="-1"}}, not defying

of my research.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now, what brings you here? Have you
come for a professional consultation on

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, wait...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I heard all about your assistance with

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes? What is it?{{pageBreak}}It's very risky to be standing here with
the strong wind coming in from the chasm
right now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Haven't you heard the legend that strong
winds like these happen because there's
a dragon nearby?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Haha! Just kidding, of course. But I do
wonder why you keep talking to me.{{pageBreak}}Do you really have that much to ask
a {{color id="0"}}gloom specialist{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, what is it? I'm busy. Unless you
have questions for a {{color id="0"}}gloom specialist{{color id="-1"}},
that is...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I suppose I could make time for that.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm busy, but since you helped Tauro, I'll

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, ahem, if I'm honest, even an expert
like me doesn't know EXACTLY what
gloom really is.
The Depths—you know the Depths, don't
you? The vast, dark expanse that these
chasms lead to?
{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Anyway, one can find gloom all over the
Depths. It emerges from these chasms to
taint the surface.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Just{{color id="0"}} touching it will steal your vitality{{color id="-1"}}, so
watch out. Dreadful stuff.

*sigh* Unfortunately, that's about as far
as my research has taken me.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Eh? What's this? Are you asking because
you're planning a trip down the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}?
What bravery!
If you touch {{color id="0"}}gloom {{color id="-1"}}and become unwell,
{{color id="0"}}come to the surface{{color id="-1"}} right away. {{delay15}}That's the
most important thing.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Certain {{color id="0"}}foods{{color id="-1"}} may help. I did feel better
when I tried nibbling a {{color id="0"}}yellow plant {{color id="-1"}}I
found near some fallen ruins...
{{anim type="Think_01"}}I tried researching the plant to confirm my
results, but I can't find any records of it.

{{size value="80"}}Come to think of it, I heard {{color id="0"}}Cori{{color id="-1"}} discovered
