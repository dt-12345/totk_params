{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It's an honor to see you again!{{pageBreak}}We're moving in on a monster base up
ahead. {{delay8}}They've dug in once again.

{{anim type="Understand_01"}}After we approach, we'll wait for the right
moment and then {{color id="0"}}launch our attack{{color id="-1"}}.

Nothing would make me happier than to
have you assist us again!

to this land if we work together.
