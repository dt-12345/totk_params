{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh, it's sooo hot...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What do you mean, what's the matter?{{delay8}}
It's {{color id="0"}}hot{{color id="-1"}}! This place is sweltering!{{delay15}} Do you
have fireproof skin or something?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Blech, {{delay8}}I'll give the Depths one thing...it's
usually {{color id="0"}}never too hot or cold{{color id="-1"}}.

Wherever I'm assigned next,{{delay8}} I hope it's
somewhere other than Eldin.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Why am I "assigned" anywhere?

label: talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Isn't that obvious?


I'm in the Yiga Clan. {{delay8}}And we've been
assigned to take you down!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}heat{{color id="-1"}} is miserable.{{delay8}} What a scorcher.


I'm so dizzy, I feel like I'm getting
delirious...

{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I swear I can hear his voice{{delay8}} right nearby...


That detestable hero...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey...{{delay8}} Perfect timing.


Could you go tell the hideout that I found
an abandoned mine?{{delay15}} Or better yet, stay
here while I do it?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I just...{{delay8}}can't take this place anymore...{{delay8}}
The {{color id="0"}}heat's totally out of control{{color id="-1"}}.

{{anim type="Ease"}}I mean, the Depths aren't my favorite
place either, but at least they're {{color id="0"}}not
too hot or too cold{{color id="-1"}}.
Wherever I get assigned next,{{delay8}} I just hope
it isn't Eldin...

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, could you...{{delay8}}please report...{{delay8}}a freshly
discovered abandoned mine for me?{{delay8}} Or,
even better, keep watch while I report it?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Blech... {{delay8}}The Depths wasn't great, but at
least it was {{color id="0"}}never too hot or cold{{color id="-1"}}.

I hope they'll reassign me soon.{{delay8}} 
Anywhere's got to be better than Eldin.
