{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wow! Who'd have thought I'd run into
you again...

---
label: FriendGreet_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Hey, thanks for sharing your mushrooms
and getting my tent back!

It's because of you that the mushroom-
haven mystery is solved!

Now I'm traveling the world in search of
mushrooms I've never seen before.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My sister, Nat, and I have split up to go
on separate mushrooms hunts, so I'm
on my own.{{pageBreak}}But we promised to share whatever we've
gathered once we're reunited!

---
label: FriendGreet_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Are you still collecting mushrooms too?


My sister, Nat, and I are on separate
journeys to hunt for mushrooms we
haven't ever seen before!{{delay15}}

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've got to say I think it's strange that
the newspaper doesn't devote coverage
to mushrooms. Very odd, right?
Mushrooms are so useful. They have all
kinds of effects. But the paper just won't
write about any of that.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The newspaper really needs to put out
news about the uses of mushrooms!

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Parts of this bridge are missing. Is it
really...{{delay8}}safe to cross?

It'd be the worst to end my long journey
in search of mushrooms here.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}With parts of this bridge missing, it is
actually safe to cross? I have so many
more mushrooms to find on my journey.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Say, did you know that rain is essential
for mushroom growth?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But it does make cliffs and stuff all
slippery, which really messes up my
mushroom-hunting game.
So while I'm grateful for the rain, I wish
it would stop now.

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Rain is great for mushroom growth,
just not for mushroom hunting.

It's making the cliffs and stuff all slippery!
Will it stop now, please?

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I think you know this, but within that one
beautiful word "mushroom," there's
room for many varieties.{{pageBreak}}They grow in different places... They have
different effects...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But each kind has its uses as you travel,
so collect them as you go, and you'll
never be disappointed!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Gather mushrooms as you go. You'll
never be sorry if you do. They have so
many uses.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I can't say I'm great with high-up places.
But as long as I don't look down, I'll be
fine, right?
There is no down. Never heard of it.{{delay8}}
Only up.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm not great with high-up places. But
I can cross as long as I don't look down.
Isn't that what you do?

label: GoRange_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They say that a big ruin just dropped right
out of the sky onto a hill near here!

I'd like to see it for myself, but the way
there is too steep. I can't climb it.{{delay15}}

What's the world coming to—ruins just
falling out of the sky? Think of the poor
mushrooms. They'll be crushed!

---
label: GoRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}A big ruin fell from the sky and landed
right on top of a hill near here!

I wouldn't mind seeing it, but I can't climb
up there, and it's dangerous. Safer to stay
here and hunt for mushrooms in peace!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I wonder if mushrooms grow even on
those islands up in the sky.

Not that I have a way of getting there.
Besides, I've got a long way to go just
hunting for mushrooms down here!

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I wonder if mushrooms grow on the
islands in the sky. I'm curious, but I'll
never have a way to get up there.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You'd think I'd be fine on this bridge.
I've crossed it before.

All the same, I'm way too scared to
look down.{{delay15}}

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I should be fairly used to the height.
But no! I'm scared to look down.{{delay8}}

---
label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The thing with mushrooms is there are
many ways to prepare them.{{delay15}} Just baking
a mushroom is very tasty.
But they're even more delicious if you
combine them with other ingredients.

---
label: BackRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you combine mushrooms with other
ingredients, you can make all sorts
of delicious dishes. Try it!

Anything on mushrooms?

Don't look down...

Who needs ruins?

Are they up there too?

Mushrooms, so healthy!
