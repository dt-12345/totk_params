{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh! {{delay8}}You're the fellow I met that one time!

label: FriendGreet_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh—{{delay8}}it's you!{{delay8}} It's...{{delay8}}don't tell me...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's it! You're the fellow I saw at
New Serenne Stable!

What a coincidence! {{delay15}}I suppose fate really
wanted the two of us to run into each
other again.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I'm sure you remember my brothers—{{delay8}}
the two fools talking in circles about
swords and beasts.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I finally got fed up with them and decided
to go on a solo adventure exploring my
favorite {{color id="0"}}caves {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
You're alone too, right? {{delay15}}Alone is good.{{delay8}}
It means you don't have to put up with
endless, inane arguments.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Sometimes I do miss having people to
talk to...{{delay8}}but still, it's better this way.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, it's you!{{delay15}} You're looking well!

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Say, have you visited {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}?


If you're a {{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}aficionado,
I can't recommend it highly enough!

Especially the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}} There's no
arguing with their beauty and splendor.

label: StartPoint_02

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Speaking of traveling... {{delay15}}I wonder if my brothers
are still at New Serenne Stable, bickering about
swords and beasts...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You can scour all of Hyrule, and you'll
never see anything quite as marvelous as
the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} in Kakariko Village.
Truly. Words don't do them justice.


I wish my brothers could come see...{{delay8}}
But that'd require them to stop arguing
and actually go somewhere!

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I got into a nasty argument with my
older brothers about where to go on
our adventures.
They wanted to chase down stories about
a {{color id="0"}}legendary sword {{color id="-1"}}or some {{color id="0"}}rumored
beast{{color id="-1"}}... Nonsense, all of it!
I told them, {{delay8}}"Why waste our time on
crackpot theories instead of exploring
the real, tangible {{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}around us?"{{pageBreak}}But we just kept arguing in circles.
Finally, I decided to leave them behind
at {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wonder what the two of them are
doing now... {{delay8}}Probably just where I left
them, bickering over fairy tales...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Say, I have time to kill!{{delay15}} I'm going to teach
you a bit about weapons.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Did you know that the {{color id="0"}}material {{color id="-1"}}a {{color id="0"}}weapon{{color id="-1"}}
is made from changes its characteristics?

For example, {{color id="0"}}wooden {{color id="-1"}}weapons are
{{color id="0"}}flammable{{color id="-1"}}, whereas {{color id="0"}}metal {{color id="-1"}}weapons can
attract {{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}}.
That's why it's important to choose your
{{color id="0"}}weapon{{color id="-1"}} depending on the conditions of
the place you're in.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If you want to be a first-class adventurer,
you'd better keep that in mind!

label: RainPoint_00

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Rain, rain, and more rain...{{delay15}} When the
weather's like this, I get a little on edge.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}See... {{delay8}}Once, on a day just like this, I was
holding an {{color id="0"}}iron sword {{delay8}}{{color id="-1"}}and it got struck
by {{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}}.
The pain was unimaginable. I'm getting
cold sweats just thinking about it...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}After that, I swore I would always take
cover at the first sign of bad weather.

So... You go ahead. I'll stay here for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey! Have you seen them? {{delay8}}Have you
seen the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?

Recently, some of the ruins were hit by
falling debris and lost their shape...

But still, they're wondrous. Absolutely
worth the trip to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I mean, if the Zonai Survey Team is
studying them, you know they must
be something special!

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You saw them, right? {{delay8}}Those {{color id="0"}}floating ruins{{color id="-1"}}
by the side of the road?

Supposedly there's a shrine on top
of them.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Which certainly piques my curiosity.
But how to get up there?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If only it wasn't so high up...

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Did those {{color id="0"}}floating ruins {{color id="-1"}}pique your
curiosity too?

That thing on top... I mean, that's got to
be a shrine, hasn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. I just wish the ruins were floating a
little lower to the ground.

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Without a doubt, the highlight of my
adventures is {{color id="0"}}visiting ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

For instance, did you hear about the
massive {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins {{color id="-1"}}they found in
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}?
They're calling them {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}}
Good name, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's easy to understand, but something
about rings feels eternal, you know?
It's poetic.
The rumor is that the brilliant new chief of
the village came up with it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Exploring {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} is one of the thrills of
adventuring. Especially {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} that no
one's been to before!
I hear that lots of new {{color id="0"}}caves {{color id="-1"}}appeared
in {{color id="0"}}Lanayru{{color id="-1"}}, to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}, after
the Upheaval.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There are bound to be some that have
never been explored.

But if I keep talking without taking action,
then I'm just like my brothers. {{delay8}}Perhaps I'll
set off to see them myself.
