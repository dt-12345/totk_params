{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Good morning.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hello.


Stay aware of the surroundings here.
Things sometimes fall from above...

label: Greeting_Evening

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Good evening. {{delay8}}It's dark out, so mind
where you're walking.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}Mmm...

label: Greeting_Day_Rain

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, what are you doing out in this rain?

label: Greeting_Evening_Rain_00

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Good evening. But... What are you doing
out in this rain?

---
label: talk_Day_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you here to help us with our
investigation of these ruins?

Thanks to the extreme temperatures
around here, we're only able to work a
little bit at a time.
The days are so hot that you'll pass out
quick if you're not in the shade. And the
nights... {{delay8}}Just so, so cold...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Really, the only thing to look forward to is
Fenlin's cooking.

Her meals fill me up with enough energy
to forget about the temperature! {{delay15}}It must
be some kind of secret recipe.

---
label: talk_Day_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So hot... If not for the shade, I'd pass
out from this heat. {{delay15}}Ugh.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}If only it would rain... Being soaked would
keep us cool while we investigate
these ruins.
Hmph. {{delay15}}I could go for some of Fenlin's
cooking right now.

The days are so hot that you'll pass out

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But thanks to this rain, we can actually
get some stuff done!

---
label: talk_Day_Rain_ItemGet
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Take a look at this... You know, why don't
you keep it?

---
label: talk_Day_Rain_00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If only it would rain in Gerudo Canyon...{{delay8}}
Being soaked would keep us cool while
we work.

label: talk_Day_Rain_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Even when the sun is high in the sky,
a good rainstorm makes it possible to get
work done.
It's time to investigate our very
hearts out!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Or it would be, but now that everything is
soaked, it's a bit harder to spot details...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you here to help us with our

Thanks to the extreme temperatures
around here, we're only able to work a
little bit at a time.
The nights are so cold that, without a
fire, you'd freeze solid! And the days...
Just so, so hot...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Really, the only thing to look forward to is
Fenlin's cooking.

Her meals fill me up with enough energy

label: talk_Evening_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Brr... It's so cold...


If I don't keep myself warm, I'm gonna
freeze solid!

Hmph.{{delay15}} I could go for some of Fenlin's
cooking right now.

label: talk_Evening_Rain_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you here to help us with our
investigation of these ruins? Sadly, we
can't really work right now...
The temperatures are pretty extreme
around here, you see.

The nights are so cold that, without a
fire, you'd freeze solid! And with the rain
on top of that...
Well, we just can't get any work done
safely right now.

---
label: talk_Evening_Rain_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Looks like I might as well give up on
furthering the investigation today. {{delay8}}Time to
prep for tomorrow and get some sleep.

---
label: talk_Midnight
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Make sure you rest up so your mind and
body are ready for whatever the next
day might hold.
The temperature will get you if you
aren't careful...

It's getting hot...

It's getting cold...

Ahh, this rain is nice...

label: Balloon_Evening_Rain

Rain? That's too bad.

Zzz... Zzz...

---
label: talk_Day_00_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ahhh... Investigating ruins is not an easy
job, that's for sure.

I used to get through the days by looking
forward to Fenlin's cooking...

But now she's gone off to Gerudo Town,
so I can't even do that!

She should return at some point, but it's
been a while since she left... {{delay15}}I really do
miss her cooking.

---
label: talk_Day_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wonder when Fenlin will get back.


Maybe there's some reason she can't
leave Gerudo Town right now?

I hope she returns soon though. Without
her cooking, I'm really feeling the wear
and tear of investigating.
