Aster is one of Medda's children. She's a
very active girl.{{pageBreak}}I believe we have Medda to thank for that
charming bob cut she sports.{{pageBreak}}She loves her father and always wants to
talk about his comings and goings.{{pageBreak}}Lately, she's been especially focused on
the Hylian tomatoes Medda is growing.{{pageBreak}}For a time, she seemed out of sorts after
Ms. Cece bought their house next to the
clothing shop.{{pageBreak}}But she was back to her usual bright self
soon enough, noting that her new home is
cute, colorful, and "close to froggy."{{pageBreak}}She has a real knack for finding the silver
lining in every situation!

Karin is the only daughter of the mayor
and his wife. She's kind-hearted but shy,
and seems to lack self-confidence.{{pageBreak}}She's very perceptive though. She has a
way of seeing right to the core of things.{{pageBreak}}I'm sure you know, Princess, that Mayor
Reede has been breeding vegetables to
appeal to the younger generation.{{pageBreak}}It was Karin who first noticed that her
peers were losing interest in produce.{{pageBreak}}She figured this out based on nothing but
the number of customers and total items
in stock at the general store.{{pageBreak}}I see her one day becoming a scholar to
rival Purah. Possibly even surpassing her!

Azu is the brother of Ivee from the 
general store. But he'll tell you his true
identity is A-Zoom, the "big-time hero"!{{pageBreak}}He and Sefaro used to be inseparable.{{pageBreak}}But ever since the dye shop started
getting more clients, A-Zoom has been
left to patrol after school alone.{{pageBreak}}Although his mother is Amira, one of the
town gossips, he keeps a close eye of his
own on the goings-on within the village.{{pageBreak}}It may seem like simple child's play, but
people really do straighten up when they
know they're being watched.{{pageBreak}}As long as he's on patrol, I think we have
nothing to fear in Hateno Village from any
would-be evildoers.

Sefaro is the son of Sayge from the dye
shop. He's a bit of a firebrand, but also
one of my brightest students.{{pageBreak}}After class, he always selects a book to
read quietly by himself.{{pageBreak}}He already reads at an adult level and
doesn't shy away from difficult subjects,
such as the Calamity.{{pageBreak}}The family business has been booming
ever since Cece came to town, which may
make it hard for him to study at home.{{pageBreak}}Sayge has an artisan's spirit and would
rather have his son helping out at the
store than going to school.{{pageBreak}}But everyone learns differently. I want our
school to be a place where children can
get an education no matter their needs.

I understand you'll be heading soon to
Hyrule Castle to investigate the reports
of strange phenomena there.{{pageBreak}}I trust you'll be fine with Link at your side.
Nevertheless, I can't shake this strange
tightness in my chest.{{pageBreak}}It's similar to what I felt right before the
Calamity, come to think of it.{{pageBreak}}The children know you as Ms. Zelda,
their beloved teacher and mentor.{{pageBreak}}But I know that Princess Zelda's duties
are wider-ranging than that. Take care,
Princess, and return to us soon.
