{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh! {{delay8}}You're that special voe the guard was
talking about.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}My name is Ashai.{{delay8}} I'm in charge of
teaching the "Voe and You" class to
the Gerudo.

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, I see... {{delay8}}You're that special voe the
guard was talking about.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}My name is Ashai.{{delay8}} I'm in charge of
teaching the "Voe and You" class to
the Gerudo.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Have you set your heart on
someone special?

---
label: 0000
---
I have!

---
label: 0001
---
I haven't...

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heheh, you don't hold back anything,
do you?

Most vai value honesty in a voe.{{delay8}} That's a
good trait for you to have.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, is that right?


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Don't let love pass you by. Things just
kind of sparkle when you're in love,
you know...

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You're welcome to sit in on a lesson,
if you're interested.

Voe aren't normally allowed in town, so it
would be a rare treat for the class if you
showed up.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Maybe you could come by in the evening?
That class is for the older Gerudo.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}The daytime class is for the younger
students—I don't think they're quite
ready to meet a voe.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Would you like to sit in on a lesson?
It would probably be a great learning
experience for you and for the class!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Maybe you could come by in the evening?
That class is for the older Gerudo.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}The daytime class is for the younger
students—I don't think they're quite ready
to meet a voe.

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll be starting the lesson once everyone
is here.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But this class, the daytime class, is for
the younger students. You're going to
have to leave.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}You're welcome in the evening though!
That class is for the older vai.

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Don't {{delay8}}be {{delay8}}nervous.


The lesson will start once everyone is
here and seated. {{delay15}}It shouldn't be too much
longer, I don't think...

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}I wonder if it's too early to be
teaching the young ones about voe.

Then again, the more they know, the
better prepared they are for the world
around them...

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Sometimes I think about the students that
recently graduated from this class.

They've set out to explore the world and
possibly find the voe of their dreams, but
they aren't exactly seasoned travelers...
I hope they're OK. Last I heard, they were
near Outskirt Stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm sure everything is going fine.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hm... {{delay8}}I wonder if I've taught them all
I can...

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Or maybe I should be the one learning from them?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}My recent students have really been
picking up my lessons quickly. It's such
a pleasant surprise!
I don't think there's much more I can
teach them.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I wonder if it's time I set out to try to
find my true love again...

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}So this is when we usually have the class
for the younger students.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You might not know this, but it's
something of a rule in Gerudo Town that
young vai don't speak with voe.
Since this class is for young vai, I can't let
you come in.

You're more than welcome to come to the
class in the evening! It's just this one that
is off-limits.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The guards will have to lock you up if you
get caught breaking our laws, and no one
wants that, right?

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh. {{delay15}}You again.


I told you already that this class is for the
younger students only.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}If I catch you again, I'm going to call
the guards, and they'll lock you up
straight away.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So... Seriously. This class is off-limits,
but you can come to the class in the
evening, OK?

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}OK, listen. Sometimes people with a
special connection can learn the subtle
hints of their partner's words or actions.
They learn that "this" really means "that,"
or they can tell when their partner says
they're fine but they actually aren't.
You and I do not have that kind of
connection. When I say you cannot
come into the daytime class...
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I mean you absolutely cannot come into
the daytime class.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It is so exhausting when someone only
hears what they want to hear...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Guards! There's a voe breaking the law!

---
label: talk0015
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Teacher! {{delay8}}There's a voe!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}OK, class, let's get started.


Today, we're going to talk a bit about how
to tell when a voe is being genuine and
when he is not!

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}A voe's behavior can tell you a lot about
the kind of person he is.

It's important to know that voe are
capable of bending the truth or even
telling outright lies.
Keep a clear head and your eyes peeled!
Someone may not be as trustworthy as
they first appear!

---
label: talk0043
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Ooo, that reminds me...


Did you know that there's a secret room {{color id="0"}}behind the
shelf in the canteen{{color id="-1"}} down in the shelter?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0044
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Really? Wow! {{delay15}}I wonder if whoever made the shelter
is hiding something...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0045
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}That's underneath the jail, right? Do you think
the secret room connects to the {{color id="0"}}jail{{color id="-1"}}?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0108
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Maybe it's too early to be teaching these
young ones about the voe of the world?

---
label: talk0109
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Learning as much as you can about voe
behavior is very important.{{delay15}}

Once you're out in the world looking for
that perfect voe, remember that they will
often make up reasons to talk with you.
They always want attention from vai,
after all...

---
label: talk0038
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Oh no! That reminds me that my sister, Rotana,
wanted me to do something for her!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0039
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It had to do with finding a big stone stela with text...
or writing...on it, right?

You have to deal with a lot since you've got an
archaeologist for an older sister, don't you?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0040
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Maybe she was talking about the{{color id="0"}} pillars over by the
entrance{{color id="-1"}} to the class? {{delay8}}The ones with the drawings
on them?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0041
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh yeah, there are two...


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But I think if you look at them from {{color id="0"}}over by the voe
dummies{{color id="-1"}}, they fit together like one stela, huh?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0110
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Yeah, that sounds right to me. {{delay15}}I keep forgetting
to tell her about it...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0111
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Let's talk a bit about how voe behave.


They like to suggest that vai join them in
activities, but they don't always want you
to accept right away.
Strangely, sometimes they want to feel
like they earned your company...

---
label: talk0112
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Hey, that reminds me! My sister, Rotana, suggested
I investigate something she heard about!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0113
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh yeah! She said something about an orb with
a pattern carved on it, right?

You have to deal with a lot since you've got an
archaeologist for an older sister, don't you?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0114
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard someone talking about something called a
"{{color id="0"}}caravan squad{{color id="-1"}}" in {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}, and how
someone there maybe had an orb like that?
Could that be the orb?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0117
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! I think I saw an orb like that when I was playing
on {{color id="0"}}top of the kitchen in the{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}}!

I dunno if that's the orb your sister heard
about though...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0118
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{size value="80"}}Was that the thing Sumati was leaning against at
the{{color id="0"}} canteen in the shelter{{color id="-1"}}?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0120
---
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Could it be that they're talking about my orb?
The one I found on the sand mound near the
side of the shop?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No... I don't know if that's the same orb she's
looking for. {{delay15}}I won't say anything...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0119
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I think I saw an orb near the {{color id="0"}}waterways that run on
top of the walls{{color id="-1"}}.

But that was before the sand shroud showed up.
Everything is probably buried under sand now...

Aaand...that might not even be the orb you're
looking for.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0042
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Rotana's suggestions are always actually really
annoying tasks she wants me to do.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh,{{delay8}} maybe I should not accept right away!
If I make my sister wait, maybe she'll stop
making annoying suggestions...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0115
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Remember, you absolutely can just accept
an invitation too.

{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Maybe it's too early to be teaching these
young ones about voe?

---
label: talk0116
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}OK, there's gonna be a test on voe
behavior today.

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I don't think the students are even listening
sometimes, but this test will show if I'm right
or not.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0130
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK, Pearle!


Can you name one behavior of a voe?

---
label: talk0121
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I sure can!{{delay15}} Voe tell lies!

---
label: talk0122
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Correct, Pearle!{{delay15}} So you were
paying attention!

But remember, sometimes voe tell lies
because they get nervous and don't know
what to say.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's all right to humor them in the moment
if it happens, OK?

---
label: talk0123
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK, so next up is...{{delay15}}Kalani!

---
label: talk0124
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK! {{delay15}}A voe will make up reasons to come
talk to a vai because they like getting
attention from vai.

---
label: talk0125
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}An excellent answer!{{delay15}} I love it, and I have
nothing more to add.

---
label: talk0126
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}All right, Dalia, your turn!

---
label: talk0127
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Easy! If a voe invites you out on an
adventure or something, you can
act disinterested!
This will make them wonder what is
interesting to you.

And with their curiosity piqued, they'll
be more open to letting you decide what
to do!

---
label: talk0128
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}That... {{delay8}}OK,{{delay8}} yes, that is correct.


{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}That wasn't in my lesson. {{delay8}}Where did she pick that
up from?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0129
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Phew! I'm so relieved!


I was genuinely worried that you all
weren't paying any attention to
my lessons.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Actually, you were demonstrating another
technique—pretend to be disinterested
when you are actually really interested!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}And... I fell for it!


{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}They're naturals. It's almost terrifying.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}This is where I teach the class on voe.
It's only for students who are willing
to engage!
If you're interested, you're welcome to
join, but you'll have to participate!

---
label: 0050

Count me in!

---
label: 0051
---
Count me out!

---
label: talk0052

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see...{{delay8}} That's too bad... {{delay8}}

---
label: talk0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}OK, everyone! Pay attention!


Today we're going to have a very special
lesson—we have a voe here with us!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Just try to relax and be your regular,
normal selves when you're talking to him!

All right...

---
label: talk0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Nali...{{delay8}} I know you can do this.

---
label: talk0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Pritana... {{delay8}}Let's see what you can do.

---
label: talk0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Deltan... {{delay8}}Show us what you know.

---
label: talk0060
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}All right, that's enough...

---
label: talk0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}...{{delay15}}Teacher, I...

---
label: talk0061
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Cry"}}I...{{delay15}} I can't...


I can't look directly at his face!

---
label: talk0065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That's OK. {{delay15}}We can stop here for now.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You will have to do something about that
fear eventually...

But I think once you muster the courage
to face a voe, even just one time, your
fear will wash away forever.

---
label: talk0086
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I'm sorry. I imagine that was a bit
unexpected, wasn't it?

You see, she's never seen a voe in
person. She's only seen them in drawings
or in re-creations like the voe dummies.
{{anim type="Think"}}I suspect that if you {{color id="0"}}hid your face{{color id="-1"}}, it
would be easier. It's probably just too
early to make eye contact while chatting.
I hope you aren't feeling discouraged
though. It would be wonderful if you
visited class again.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Sarqso for taking the time today.

---
label: talk0092
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It's all right, Nali.{{delay15}} Look. The face is
well covered.

---
label: talk0066
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hey, I can talk to him like this!


{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}So...{{delay8}}um...hi? {{delay8}}My name is Nali.


{{anim type="LaughL"}}I make an amazing wildberry crepe.
And...{{delay8}}I hope to share one I've made with
a voe some day!

---
label: talk0067
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Amazing job, Nali!


Voe are known to think with their
stomachs sometimes, so mentioning
your cooking was a good idea.
They're especially susceptible to sweets,
so well done with the wildberry crepe!

---
label: talk0068
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Sarqso to you as well.


It was very kind of you to conceal your
face for Nali.

It seems like that's just the thing she
needed to get past her anxiety and talk
to you.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}You are more than welcome to return to
the class in the future!

---
label: talk0088
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So...{{delay8}}um...hi? {{delay8}}My name is Nali.


{{anim type="LaughL"}}I make an amazing wildberry crepe. And...{{delay8}}
I hope to share one I've made with a voe
some day!
We'll split the crepe in half and eat
it together, I think...

---
label: talk0089
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That was excellent, Nali!


By mentioning sweets, you captured both
the stomach and then the heart of the voe
in one swift move!
And you kept your own needs in mind,
splitting the crepe in half and not simply
giving him the whole thing!

---
label: talk0090
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}And sarqso to you as well for spending
your time with us.

Thanks to you, Nali seems to have gotten
past at least some of her anxiety.

This is a big day for her!


{{anim type="LaughS"}}Of course, it's important for all of them to
keep practicing. Please come spend some
time with us again!

But no one should ever force that kind

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm sorry if that worried or scared you.


Voe are an uncommon sight to most of
the vai here, so hopefully you can forgive
their reactions.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Don't be discouraged though. It would
be great to have you visit us again.

It's wonderful when a voe and a vai can
communicate their needs to one another.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}And it's even better when they can do it
on an unspoken level!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Pritana, I think you've got a lot
of potential!

---
label: talk0073
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I think you've really helped Pritana find
her confidence!

She'll have to keep practicing, of course,
but this was a very big step for her!

Hopefully you'll visit us again!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh! We meet again! Could this be
coincidence or maybe something else...

Sarq for the Noble Pursuit before.
It reminded me of something...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you heard about how if a voe offers
a vai Noble Pursuit twice, they are meant
to be together?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's only a rumor, of course!

---
label: talk0095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}This is just practice!{{delay8}} You don't need to
actually give it to her!

You two do seem to get along well,
though. I can see why you'd want
to continue!

---
label: talk0096
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Pritana, you're positively glowing!

---
label: talk0098
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It was quite clever to highlight a
connection between Noble Pursuit and
spending time together!
You might find this is easier than you
believe, Pritana!

label: talk0057

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}There's no reason for me to practice.
I've been abandoned by love...{{delay8}} By luck...
{{delay8}}By happiness.
And you're only setting yourself up for
disaster by talking with someone like me.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}I'm just fated to be unhappy.{{delay8}} Steer
clear or you'll catch my misfortune.

---
label: talk0064
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Deltan... You're your own worst
enemy sometimes...

I've told you already that every time you
sigh, you push your own happiness away.

---
label: talk0097
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I know you say that, but...

---
label: talk0099
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We can stop the lesson for now, I think.


Deltan,{{delay8}} I really do believe that when you
find your confidence again, things will
look a little better to you.

---
label: talk0082
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This lesson was a bit tough. Deltan is still
feeling the pain from her last relationship,
and it's really taken a toll.
I wish there was something I could show
her to help...

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}You know, she had mentioned a certain accessory
that would help her connect with others...

But those only come from that village in Necluda,
off to the east.

That's...{{delay8}}not exactly convenient.{{size value="100"}}

label: talk0100

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey!


That thing you've got there...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Isn't that a ring garland? {{delay15}}They're famous
for binding the destinies of people!

---
label: talk0101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This is the first time I've ever seen one—
I'd always just heard rumors about them.

I honestly never thought I'd see one
for real...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I mean...what are the odds that something
sold in a village far, far away to the east
would make it all the way here.
Plus, that it would be carried by this voe
of all voe—{{delay8}}the only voe that can actually
enter town.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}And. {{delay15}}Then. {{delay15}}This voe would decide to visit
this class and talk to me...

...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What an amazing series of events!
That can only mean that I haven't been
forsaken by luck and love!
{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thank you so much!

---
label: talk0084
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}There you go, Deltan!{{delay15}}


It's important to remember that luck and
love aren't things that run out!{{delay15}} Sometimes
they just take the long way to get to you.
As your teacher, I'm very happy to see
you motivated again!

---
label: talk0085
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I really do appreciate your help, even if
I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't
help everyone grow on my own.
But sometimes the best way for students
to learn is with some practical experience.{{delay15}}
Sarqso for your help!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This is hardly the end of the lessons,
though.

Please come back and take part whenever
you like. Everyone really grew because
you stopped by!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You've traveled all over, haven't you?


Have you seen that fluffy, light ice that
floats down from the sky? I think it's
called snow?

I sure have!

Never seen it...

label: talk0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Ooh, really? That's so nice...{{delay8}} I haven't
ever seen it myself.

I hope one day I and the voe I am fated to
meet will see it together.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'm sure sharing experiences with your
true love is a magical thing... 

---
label: talk0104

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Ah, I see. {{delay8}}I haven't seen it either.


I hope one day I and the voe I am fated to
meet will see it together.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'm sure sharing experiences with your
true love is a magical thing... 

---
label: talk0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's great, Deltan! It really looks like
you're coming into your own!

Voe can be very alert to the words we use
to describe things, and it can really help
both of you learn if you're meant to be!
Describing an experience as "magical"
captures how you feel about it. {{delay15}}That
openness can be a double-edged sword...
But it's better to express yourself than
pretend to be someone you're not!

---
label: talk0107
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}As always, sarqso for coming by and
helping out.

Feel free to come around whenever you
want to. {{delay15}}You're always welcome here!
