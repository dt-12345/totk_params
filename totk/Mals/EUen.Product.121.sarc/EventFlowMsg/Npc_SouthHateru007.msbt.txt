{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Thank you! I'm saved!{{delay8}} I despaired thinking
no one would find me here!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You might be wondering how I got here.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}A fine question!{{delay8}} To explain, I must tell you
about...{{delay8}}the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}!

Some nights, no matter the moon's phase,
it rises full and red. Precisely at midnight,
the whole sky turns crimson.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}And then...{{delay15}}defeated monsters appear
again!{{delay15}} There you have it.

{{size value="125"}}The {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It is my life's work to research this event.
Why do the monsters revive?{{delay8}} What
connects them to the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}?
I thought if I studied the monsters'
ecology, I would discover something...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I got too close, and here I am.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You saved me again!{{delay8}} Thank you!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The sky turning red... Slain monsters
returning to life...

I want to unravel the mysteries of the
{{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}Unfortunately, going to the
moon to investigate has proven difficult.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That being the case, I decided to research
by closely observing the monsters in their
natural habitat.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}But it looks like I got too close!{{delay8}} Again!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Phew! Thank you for rescuing me. {{delay8}}Again!


{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I'm sorry this keeps happening. But when
I dig into a mystery, I just can't let go.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Why do the monsters revive when the
{{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} rises...

I'll do whatever it takes to figure it out.
And if that means sneaking into their dens
again{{delay8}} and again{{delay8}} and again...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ahem.{{delay8}} But it looks like I wasn't as careful
as I thought.

---
label: Talk05

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}*sigh* You saved me.{{delay15}} Again.{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}} No, I'm
grateful. Really!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} You think there's something I might
be missing?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Hmm...{{delay8}} Let me think...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, the biggest monster seemed to be
in charge...{{delay8}} That's about it.

{{size value="80"}}But that doesn't get me any closer to understanding
the blood moon.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}In any case, I'm saved! Thanks...{{delay8}}again.

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I knew you would come!


You dispatch the monsters with such
impressive skill.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's just...once the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} rises,
they'll all come back.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Monsters...{{delay15}} What in the world are they?

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Thank you, thank you!{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I had no idea how I would escape this—
What would you call it? A monster fort?

I thought I was destined for a monstrous
cook pot. I had almost given up hope!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Huh...{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}} What do monsters eat, anyway? Could be
worth investigating...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}{{size value="100"}}In any case,{{delay8}} I can't thank you enough!{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I knew it!{{delay8}} I just knew you'd rescue me!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You have my endless thanks...again.{{delay15}}
And— Oh! I just realized something!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}With your assistance,{{delay8}} I can devote
myself to researching the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}
without fear.
It doesn't matter how many times I'm
captured and rescued...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I'll never give up!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So keep up the good work.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Please, take this for saving me.{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm...{{delay8}} I was about to give you an elixir
made of monster parts, but it appears
your pouch is full.
Why don't you just take this instead?

---
label: Talk10

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}And for your invaluable assistance with
my research...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Take this as a token of my

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm...{{delay8}} Your pouch is full.


In that case, why don't you just take
this instead?

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I found that stunning ore on the very day
you rescued me. {{delay8}}Oh, how it sparkled!

I was keeping it as a good luck charm,
but now I leave it with you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You want another? All right...

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy"}}No... {{delay8}}That's not enough to properly
convey my gratitude! {{delay8}}Here!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy"}}No! {{delay8}}I can't insult you with that pathetically

---
label: Talk25

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh...{{delay8}} Did I fill up your pouch?


I was going to give you another one, but...{{delay15}}
please, take this instead.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmmm...{{delay15}} I could have sworn I'd escaped.
I suppose that was just a momentary
delusion. Alas!

me out of this cell?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is a full moon...


Mmm.{{delay8}} I can feel the moonlight pouring
down, cleansing my spirit...

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight the moon begins to wane...


Mmm.{{delay8}} The moon's fullness may now be
receding, but I find her no less beautiful.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is the third-quarter moon...


Mmm.{{delay8}} Are you lonely, my moon, with only
half of yourself for company?

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is a waning crescent moon...


Mmm. {{delay8}}The new moon will be here
tomorrow.{{delay8}} I must admit, it breaks my
heart to say goodbye to each old moon.

---
label: Moon_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is a new moon...


Mmm.{{delay8}} The new moon is hesitant to show
herself. Perhaps she's shy?

---
label: Moon_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is a crescent moon...


Mmm.{{delay8}} A golden arc through the sky...{{delay8}}
She's beautiful, isn't she?

---
label: Moon_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is a first-quarter moon...


Mmm.{{delay8}} Doesn't she look like a celestial
bow, eager to shoot the sun?{{delay8}}
What courage.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight is the 13th-day moon...

path to fullness.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Rain tonight...

I don't feel like myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Do you think we'll see the moon tonight?


Mmm.{{delay8}} I hope this rain lets up soon.

label: Moon_00

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Tonight is a red moon! At last...{{delay8}}
A {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}!

Hurry!{{delay8}} I want to observe the blood moon
from a better vantage point.

label: Moon_Before

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Tonight's moon...{{delay8}} I have a feeling that it
might be red!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So please hurry up. {{delay8}}This is a terrible spot
for me to conduct my observations.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Last night was amazing, wasn't it?
The moon was so red and beautiful...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It makes me feel alive!{{delay8}} What could cause
such a remarkable phenomenon?

There are still so many mysteries to solve.
I will eagerly await the blood moon's
next visit.

short so a monster doesn't surprise us.
