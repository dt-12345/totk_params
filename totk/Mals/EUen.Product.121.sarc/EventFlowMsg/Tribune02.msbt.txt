{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wh— AH!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh! Phew, it's just you, partner. I should
have known you'd use the rain to move
about more quietly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh! Phew, it's just you, partner. I should

move about without being seen.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh! Phew, it's just you, partner. I should

grogginess to sneak up on me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh! Phew, it's just you, partner. I should

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh! Phew, it's just you, partner. I should

a distraction to sneak up on me.

Hmph, my feathers really are ruffled,
aren't they?

---
label: Talk_Ready_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! No, you spooking me isn't what I'm
talking about! Although that did a number
on me too...
She... I mean, Princess Zelda was...{{delay15}}
{{delay8}}Princess Zelda...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_Ready_1011
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}She was kidnapped!{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Have you heard of the {{color id="0"}}Yiga{{color id="-1"}}, partner?


They're a gang of lowlifes who
worship an evil entity and plot
against Princess Zelda...
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}And now they claim that they've
kidnapped her!

What's more, they're not even worried
about being found. In fact, they sent
a message to the newspaper.
"We have taken Zelda to the carved-out
heart of the towering twins!"

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Understandably, Ms. Traysi is all worked
up over this news!

---
label: Talk_Ready_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I came here because the word "twins"
made me think of Dueling Peaks Stable.

But I haven't found any other clues so far.
There must be something...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Partner, we cannot allow the chirps and
warbles of evil to go unanswered!

---
label: Talk_Search_1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Oh! Hey, partner! You heard anything?
Any new chirps and warbles?

---
label: Talk_Search_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm keeping watch in case anything
suspicious happens, but it's hard to
see much at night...

---
label: Talk_Search_1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm keeping watch, but I doubt the Yiga
are dumb enough to try anything during
the day.

---
label: Talk_Search_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm checking the perimeter of the stable
for anyone acting suspicious.{{delay15}}
Nothing yet...

---
label: Talk_Search_1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can't help but think of this rain like
someone's tears. I hope Princess Zelda
is safe...

---
label: Talk_Search_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The message the Yiga Clan left behind...


"We have taken Zelda to the carved-out
heart of the towering twins!"

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}"Twins" must be connected to Dueling
Peaks Stable, but that's all I've got...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The chirps and warbles around this
story are far too important to ignore.
The princess's life could be on the line!
Keep your eyes and ears open for any
new clues!

label: Talk_2101

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What's this?


"Yiganapping of Princess Zelda? Bold
Declaration of Foul Crime!"

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The Yiga are that group of Sheikah who
went rogue and have it out for the royal
family of Hyrule...
"We have taken Zelda to the carved-out
heart of the towering twins!"

That's disturbing imagery...{{delay15}} Hmm,
"twins"... Do they mean {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}? 

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}That's really close to here. Could it be...

---
label: Talk_2103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"Yiganapping of Princess Zelda? Bold
Declaration of Foul Crime!"

Rereading that headline doesn't soften
the blow at all... This leaves me with a pit
in my stomach.
And this declaration. "The carved-out
heart of the towering twins..." What could
it mean?
I keep turning it over in my head. Twins...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Wait, could the twins be...{{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}?
And it's right by the stables too!

label: Talk_2100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="ZeldaTalkPositive_01"}}Oh, Link! You came to save me! You
recognize who I am, right? Zelda!

I knew you'd come and save me. Quickly,
do something to open this cage!

---
label: Talk_2010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="ZeldaSurprise_03"}}Only the valiant, golden-haired knight
known as Link could move such a sturdy
cage like that!

label: Talk_2011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Bwahaha, I knew we'd lure in some heroic
wannabes if we used Zelda as bait, but
we've even managed to snare you!

---
label: Talk_2013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, don't worry! Once we find the real
Zelda, we'll send her to join you! Promise!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Beware_04"}}All right, everybody. This is definitely the
golden-haired golden boy. Get him!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}You can't run, coward! We won't let you
get away!

---
label: Talk_Excape_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?


You're saying the Yiga sent us that letter
all to lure YOU into a trap?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Er, why would the Yiga give a hoot about
you, partner? Kinda tootin' your own horn
there a little bit?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Aaanyway, getting back on track here...{{delay15}}
It's a huge relief knowing that Princess
Zelda hasn't actually been kidnapped!

Be prepared!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar"}}Hey, partner!{{delay8}} What are you up to
down there?

---
label: Talk_3001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been circling the area for leads. I was
sure that the word "twins" in that vicious
letter was referring to Dueling Peaks.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Now I'm not so sure. I've found nothing
at all anywhere around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What about you? Have you figured
anything out on your end?

---
label: Talk_3003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'll head off and start pecking away at an
article about the Yiga Clan's scheme.
People need to know the truth!
