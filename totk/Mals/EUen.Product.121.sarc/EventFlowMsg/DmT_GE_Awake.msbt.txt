So it's my destiny to fight by your side...

label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_023_b

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_024_c
---
My destiny as a sage, my duties as chief, and fighting
side-by-side with you?

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_025_b
---
Ha! Sounds like fun!

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_026_b

I will gladly strike down this so-called Demon King!

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_027_b

I guess it's time to claim my destiny!

label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_030_bb

I am the Sage of Lightning! Witness this new power
I possess!

Link, give me your hand.

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_033_b

I, Riju, the Sage of Lightning, swear that I will stand
with you!

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_034_b
---
And here—as proof of my vow!

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_037_c
---
Use that ring to call upon my power whenever you
need it.

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_038_c
---
It seems I can finally repay you.

---
label: DmT_GE_Awake_Text_039_c
---
OK, should we head back to town?
