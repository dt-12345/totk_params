{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Sorry, I'm a little preoccupied to deal
with travelers right now. {{delay15}}That's what you
are, right? A traveler?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It isn't safe here. {{color id="0"}}Captain Hoz's squad of
the monster-control crew {{color id="-1"}}is going to
engage the monsters around here soon.{{pageBreak}}I bet you by now, they're already locked
in combat with the monsters at the {{color id="0"}}lair{{color id="-1"}}
to the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'm not going to stop you if you want to
go watch the sparks fly, but at least take
some precautions first.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Say, you wouldn't happen to be having
any equipment troubles, would you?{{pageBreak}}The gear I've got laid out here is all
repaired and ready to use, but...

label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The monster-control crew has a lot of
amateurs who never really learned how
to swing a sword.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}They say they're more comfortable with
their farm tools, so they left all my nice
and shiny gear behind.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}From what I've seen, you'd be better
suited to use this stuff than that bunch.{{pageBreak}}Take it with my blessing, and give the
monsters one for me, all right?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Is that you again? {{delay8}}I appreciate a traveler
who gets right up and at 'em!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Is that you again? {{delay8}}Are you here to watch
the monster-control crew at work?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}You're that traveler I met before, right?{{delay8}}
Probably don't need me to tell you to be
careful on the roads at night.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hi there. {{delay8}}Some weather we're having, eh?
Nothing but gray and murk. {{delay15}}Not that I
notice much, with my nose in my work.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The monster-control crew has a lot of
amateurs who never really learned how
to swing a sword.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It'd help them out if {{color id="0"}}someone with more
experience fighting monsters{{color id="-1"}} would
pitch in.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}All the equipment you see here is well
maintained and combat ready, but...

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Captain Hoz's squad of the monster-
control crew is engaged in a battle to
quell the monsters near here.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The fighting should be in full swing at
{{color id="0"}}Fort Hateno {{color id="-1"}}down the road to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} by
now, so I advise keeping your distance.

label: Talk_1002

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you're curious how the battle is going,
you could go watch. But take care you
don't get caught up in the fray.

label: Talk_1003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}By the way, you wouldn't happen to need
any equipment, would you?{{pageBreak}}There's some gear seized from monsters
left over. I've fixed it up as good as I can
get it, so it's yours if you want.

label: Talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I wondered if that monster-control crew
bunch had it in them, but they look more
like proper soldiers now.{{pageBreak}}And they understand the importance of
well-maintained equipment, so they show
me a little more appreciation.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If they keep shaping up like this, I bet it
won't be long before they clear out all the
monsters from Hyrule.

label: Talk_1012

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That monster-control crew bunch has
toughened up considerably.{{pageBreak}}They're taking better care of the gear
I maintain for them too. Which is nice,
since it makes my job easier.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They still carry farm tools into battle,
mind you, but whatever helps them keep
the peace is OK by me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, are you interested in that weapon?
Feel free to take it. I don't mind at all.{{pageBreak}}We seized it from the monsters,{{delay8}} and I
repaired it just to keep myself busy. But I
don't have a use for it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Your travels take you through dangerous
places, I expect. {{delay8}}By all means, take it if
you need it.
