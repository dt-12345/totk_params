{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I could use some more time alone to really
focus on my training, so can you...leave
me alone for a bit?
My training is especially challenging on
rainy days, after all. If I'm not careful,
lightning might strike my metal weapon.
I'm definitely on my toes here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hi, sorry, but I'm busy at the moment,
so I'll have to talk to you between swings.

You never know when monsters will pop
up, so I take my training very seriously.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You might've noticed, but each sword
{{color id="0"}}handles differently{{color id="-1"}}, so it's wise to try
different types to get used to the feel.

---
label: Talk_First02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you know their handling and practice
plenty, the fact that they're {{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}
won't matter so much.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If you learn the {{color id="0"}}traits of different swords{{color id="-1"}}
and use those traits to your advantage,
then the decay won't be a big deal.
Best way to learn is to spend
time training.

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Anyway, as you can see, I'm using this
area. So if you do intend to train, you'll
need to do it elsewhere.

Did you notice the unique qualities of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Word on the street is that Princess
Zelda's been sighted at Hyrule Castle.

It's crucial that I get training in wherever
I can so I'm ready to go if I get sent out
in a search party.

---
label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Speaking of, are you feeling more
comfortable with swords now?

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The soldier's broadsword is light and slim.
It was pretty easy to use, wasn't it?

With that sword, I can release {{color id="0"}}charged
attacks really quickly{{color id="-1"}}. I kinda like it.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah, the knight's broadsword! It has some
heft and increases in power if you're
{{color id="0"}}severely weakened{{color id="-1"}}.
Despite the advantage it offers, I wouldn't
suggest actively seeking out such
situations, you know?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The royal broadsword!

I can't make the most of that sword at

other swords?

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}All the swords I gave you have different
strengths, so it's worth training with all
of them.
It's taken me countless hours of training
to be able to wield them properly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Right, the soldier's broadsword. It's light

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}A soldier's broadsword is what the castle
soldiers used to fight with.

It's light and nimble, which leads me to
believe you could {{color id="0"}}unleash charged attacks
really quickly {{color id="-1"}}with it. It's a great weapon.

---
label: Talk_103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The knight's broadsword was used by
knights in defense of the castle way
back when.
Once, a monster attacked me while I was
wielding the broadsword, and I thought it
was{{color id="0"}} the end for me{{color id="-1"}}...
But I timed my swings carefully, and it
unleashed an {{color id="0"}}incredible blow{{color id="-1"}}!

Maybe it was my adrenaline, but...no.
It had to be the sword. It really
surprised me.

---
label: Talk_104

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The royal broadsword was used by

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I was going to give it to you, but it

Well, if you want it, you know where to
find it. After you've created some space,
that is.
