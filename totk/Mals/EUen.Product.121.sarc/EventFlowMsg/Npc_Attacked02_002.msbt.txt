{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You never let your guard down, even
around weak enemies. {{delay8}}I can tell you're
an adept fighter.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm a treasure hunter, y'know.{{delay15}} I can take
care of wimpy monsters like that myself!

That said, It is kind of reassuring to have
a little backup.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Not bad! Not bad at all!{{delay15}} Just watching you
move, I can tell you're no ordinary guy.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sheesh... {{delay8}}Gave me a little trouble there.
{{delay15}}Goes to show you've always got to stay
on your toes!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're a strong one!{{delay15}} I wouldn't want to be
in their monstrous shoes right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have to admit, that had me shaking in
my boots. {{delay15}}Without you, I could've been
sent to that big treasure haul in the sky!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I am but a lonely wanderer.{{delay8}} It's only fitting
that I'd be felled by monsters and left on
the roadside...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Kidding! I'm kidding. I like to be a little
dramatic sometimes, but I'm glad to still
be alive!

label: Failed01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Life is so fleeting...{{delay8}} Having been bested
by monsters, I guess I'm off to the
heavens above...
Huh, I always thought the clouds would
be softer. This just feels like the hard old
ground. {{delay15}}Wait. {{delay15}}I'm alive!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Though I still breathe, I find myself

I'm alive...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}This is to show my gratitude. {{delay15}}Perhaps you
might find it useful.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It was destiny that brought us together
here, and destiny that I give you this as
thanks. {{delay15}}Don't fight fate, now!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, me?{{delay8}} My name is Kaffi. {{delay15}}I'm just a
rootless wanderer, going any way the
wind blows.{{pageBreak}}And right now, it's blown me onto
the trail of the {{color id="0"}}Great Bandit Misko's
legendary treasure{{color id="-1"}}!
I've been following a rumor that one piece
is in a {{color id="0"}}cave near here{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Trouble is, the rumor wasn't totally clear
on where the cave was...{{pageBreak}}I traveled a long way only to come up
empty.{{delay15}} Maybe I should try searching
somewhere else?

label: GoodBye01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm still traveling the world in search of
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The rumors say there's a piece hidden in
a cave around here, but I can't find it for
the life of me.{{pageBreak}}Treasure hunting is never as easy as we
seekers would like, is it?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm still traveling the world in search of

to my next destination.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}That's not to say I don't have time to
chat, if you're so inclined.

label: Talk00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since I was a wee treasure hunter, I've
been captivated by stories of {{color id="0"}}Misko's
famous clothing collection{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
And I intend to find it with nothing but the
whispers on the winds and my carefully
honed intuition!{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It is not going well.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}My treasure sense is insistent that Misko
hid something in a cave {{color id="0"}}nearby{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But it's been wrong before. If I can't find
it, maybe I should go somewhere else.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Let's see... {{delay15}}Why don't we talk about those
Cece-clad fashion enthusiasts?{{pageBreak}}You must have seen them on the road.
The folks wearing those adorable
{{color id="0"}}mushroom-themed outfits{{color id="-1"}}?
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Those outfits {{delay8}}are high-end Cece-brand
fashion, straight from Hateno Village
in Necluda.
I guarantee you that anyone dressed like
that is after {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}To them, Misko's treasures represent the
peak of fashion.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And that has them searching high and low
for any pieces they can find.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}They're so excited about the whole thing
that they're always telling me the latest
rumors about caves and treasures.
So if you see someone dressed like that
during your travels, you should strike up
a conversation!

---
label: Talk01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The people walking the roads in
{{color id="0"}}mushroom-themed clothes{{color id="-1"}} are all after
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}!
They're more than just fashion plates.
You won't find a better source of cave
and treasure rumors anywhere.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you meet any of them in your travels,
be sure to hear them out!

label: Talk02_00

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... {{delay15}}Do you know about the little {{color id="0"}}blue{{color id="-1"}},
{{color id="0"}}glowing mystery creatures{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You'll hear the stories everywhere you go.
They apparently run away the moment
they notice you.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Curiously, {{delay15}}a lot of the reported sightings
happened{{color id="0"}} near caves{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Now, I don't know what these adorable
little guys have to do with caves...{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}but I know that if I saw one scampering
around, I probably couldn't help but chase
after it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've been hearing about sightings of {{color id="0"}}small
mystery creatures that glow pale blue {{color id="-1"}}all
over the land.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
And oddly, {{delay15}}many of the reported sightings
{{color id="0"}}happened near caves{{color id="-1"}}.

{{anim type="LaughS"}}If I saw one of those cute little critters,
{{delay8}}I probably couldn't help but chase after it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}How about this? {{delay15}}Did you know that there
are {{color id="0"}}caves where water falls{{color id="-1"}} like rain from
the ceiling?
They're tough to explore, since the "rain"
makes the walls all slippery and difficult
to climb.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}But the {{color id="0"}}sticky lizards {{color id="-1"}}scurrying around
the cave can be cooked with monster
parts to make a {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}With one swig of sticky elixir, you'll be
climbing those slick walls in no time.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Don't take my word for it—try it next time
you find yourself with monster parts
on hand.

---
label: Talk03_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You'll want a sip of {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}} before you
climb the walls of a {{color id="0"}}cave where water falls{{color id="-1"}}
like rain from the ceiling.
Just catch a {{color id="0"}}sticky lizard{{color id="-1"}} creeping around
the cave, cook it with monster parts,
and...poof! {{delay8}}Your elixir's ready.
And it's not just for caves! I personally
brew one whenever I have to climb a cliff
that's slick with rain.
{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Plus, you never know when you might get
caught climbing in a downpour! {{delay15}}Always
keep a {{color id="0"}}sticky elixir{{color id="-1"}} on you, just in case.
