Always up for shield talk...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}OK, here's the straight shot on
shield surfing—the most important thing
is which shield you choose.
So, my man, here's what I'll do for you.
I'll give you shield advice. Consider it
more thanks for rescuing Teach.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Always up for shield talk, my man. Count
on me for advice. Got plenty to say!

label: Talk23

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What, what, whaaat?!{{delay8}} No way.{{delay15}} No!{{delay8}} Way!


That's a real {{color id="0"}}Hylian shield{{color id="-1"}}?!{{pageBreak}}Oh, yeah. A {{color id="0"}}legendary shield{{color id="-1"}}. Hey, you
did good, gettin' your hands on that.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You should be able to slide really fast
with it. Even when you're not on snow.
On sand too—and sand's a beast.
That shield is super sturdy and will take
a lot of damage on the slopes. It won't
break for a long, long time.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You'll enjoy that beauty for sure.

label: Talk10

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oooh.{{delay8}} I see you're sporting a
{{color id="0"}}radiant shield{{color id="-1"}}!

Yeah, for sure. Shredders consider that
a {{color id="0"}}ridiculously rare shield{{color id="-1"}}. If you're gonna
be fearless out there, that's a good one.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Very sturdy. Slides like a dream!

label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Nice!{{delay8}} Every surfer recognizes a {{color id="0"}}shield of
the mind's eye{{color id="-1"}} when they see one.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}It's really good for sliding—easy to jump
on and get goin' too.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh...{{delay8}} Got yourself a {{color id="0"}}Gerudo shield{{color id="-1"}}, huh?
Good shield. Seems pretty sturdy. 

I've heard the Gerudo use these all the
time to slide on sand dunes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Should be great for us shield surfers
then too.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Is that shield on your back the one Teach
gave you as thanks for saving her?

Whoa. In the shield-surfing world, there's
talk that it fell from the sky, and that it's
made of a mysterious material.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}From the looks of it, seems harder to
believe that it's nice and solid. But it is.
Easy to slide on too.
Mysterious! But it's a good shield for
those who really want to slide with ease.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh...{{delay8}} You're rocking the {{color id="0"}}Daybreaker{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}
Quite the stylish choice.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Super sturdy. Sophisticated look.
Good at what it does.

Oh yeah, it's an excellent one for
shredding on the slopes.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, I know that thing.{{delay8}} Oh yeah. It's a
{{color id="0"}}steel Lizal shield{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Sturdier than sturdy. That's what it's
really known for.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That shield won't break easily if you
hit the slopes with it fiercely. Good one
for really shredding like a maniac.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That a {{color id="0"}}royal guard's shield {{color id="-1"}}I see on
your back?

It's not a bad shield. But yeah, maybe
not the best for shield surfing. It's
not sturdy enough to last.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm...{{delay8}} It's just plain too breakable.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Nope. Can't recommend it to anyone
who's tryin' to get the hang of how to
shield surf.

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh?{{delay8}} Let's see, you're carrying a
{{color id="0"}}royal shield{{color id="-1"}}, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Good shield. Handsome design. A fine
balance between sturdiness and its
ability to sliiide.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Might be too refined for a starter shield,
but yeah, good overall.

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hmm...{{delay8}} That shield you're carrying is
pretty decent.

Looks sturdy and seems like it'd slide
pretty OK.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yeah, solid choice in general for anyone
startin' out with shield surfing.

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Hang on. That shield...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}It's been modified! Yeah, that's going
to be its own thing out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I see...{{delay8}} Less friction. Easier to slide on.
Good choice for a beginner too.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Hold on. That shield...{{delay15}} It's been
modified, but...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I gotta say...{{delay15}}I think the change makes it
harder to slide on. The reverse of
what you'd want.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, no one in shield surfing's gonna
tell you not to use that. So, I guess you
can see how it goes out there.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Hold on. That shield...{{pageBreak}}Looks like it's been modified! {{delay15}}So you
made some tweaks for speed, huh?{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Doesn't look like it's any less slick, at
least. You should keep experimenting
until you get it perfect!

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Wait a minute. Your shield...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Whoa. You've attached a sled. Way to
expand what's possible! Crafting a shield
that way will really make it slide.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's a shield surfer for you—stayin'
flexible. Yeah, forget the old ways of
doing things if you need to!

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hmm?{{delay8}} Hold on there. Your shield...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}You've attached a cart. Has anyone even
done that before? Crafting a shield that
way will make it really fast!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You've got the ol' shield-surfing fire in
you, doing things no one's done.{{delay8}} The
future of our sport is bright!

label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hey, maaan!{{delay8}} You're missin' the most
critical thing. The shield!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You DO know these are pretty sacred
slopes for shield surfers, right? You
can't come in here empty-handed.{{delay15}}
No shield, no surfing. Come back when
you get your hands on a shield.

---
label: Talk31

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Can't believe anyone would come to
these most sacred slopes for shield
surfers...{{delay8}}without a shield.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're itchin' to hit the slopes, my
man, come back after you get your
hands on a shield.
