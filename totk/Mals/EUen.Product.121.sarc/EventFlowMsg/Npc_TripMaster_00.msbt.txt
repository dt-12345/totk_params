{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}warm darner{{color id="-1"}}? Good choice! When they
leave the larval stage, they're fully grown
but fragile. That's called eclosion.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Don't confuse it with "explosion," which is
very different!

---
label: Talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ooo! A warm darner!{{delay15}} You better watch
the back of your neck!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That's just a little insect humor. {{delay8}}Male
warm darners show their interest by
attaching on to the necks of their mates.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}But now that I think about it, you're
probably not his type.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}An {{color id="0"}}electric darner{{color id="-1"}}, huh?


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}You have a discerning eye. Oh!
Speaking of eyes! Darner eyes
have tens of thousands of facets.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}So many facets...{{delay15}} I wonder how discerning
they are.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Eee, an {{color id="0"}}electric darner{{color id="-1"}}! {{delay15}}This nimble little
fellow can zip right on over to me!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Darners are quite the acrobats! They can
hover, fly in loops, and even go backward!

But "backward" doesn't mean a thing to
Beedle. {{delay8}}It's only forward for me!

---
label: Talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you want a {{color id="0"}}cold darner{{color id="-1"}}, {{delay15}}you must not be
the type to give up on your dreams.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Cold darners{{color id="-1"}} don't give up on their
dreams either. They grab on tight
with all six legs and don't let go.
And by dreams, I mean prey.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Are you getting rid of this {{color id="0"}}cold darner{{color id="-1"}}

These ferocious little darlings have quite
the bite!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Here's a special Beedle tip. Gently hold
the wings together with your fingertips,
and zing! Happy darner, happy fingers!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}summerwing butterfly{{color id="-1"}}—good choice!{{delay15}}
Do you also change when no one
is looking?
Butterflies undergo metamorphosis,
meaning their bodies change completely
when they turn into an adult.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}...Huh? What did you think I meant?

---
label: Talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To be parting with this lovely {{color id="0"}}summerwing
butterfly{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} Were you perhaps hoping to
catch a female summerwing instead?
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}The males are vibrant and striking, but
females have muted colors that mimic
trees and leaves.
They're so hard to see that even Beedle
has trouble catching them!

---
label: Talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}smotherwing butterfly catch your
eye? Ah, good ol' Papilio vulcensis!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You've never heard of Papilio vulcensis?!{{delay15}}
It's what you call a smotherwing when
you're doing science with it.
But "smotherwing butterfly" is a lot
easier to say.

---
label: Talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Was the {{color id="0"}}smotherwing butterfly{{color id="-1"}}'s diet
too much for you?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}This little gourmand can taste with its
legs, and it doesn't settle for second best.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}It's going to cost Beedle a fortune to
prepare a four-course meal every night.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}You aren't getting rid of your {{color id="0"}}thunderwing

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}winterwing butterfly{{color id="-1"}}, huh?{{delay15}} You must

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}The scales coating their wings are
wintry-fresh. They put the brrr
in brrrilliant!

---
label: Talk0034

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Couldn't handle the {{color id="0"}}winterwing butterfly{{color id="-1"}}'s
eating habits, {{delay15}}huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Listen, some butterflies just prefer dung
and rotten fruit.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Rotten fruit's not for Beedle though.
{{size value="80"}}Never again.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}sunset firefly{{color id="-1"}} is dazzling! Stunning!


When I'm finished doting on this little
beauty, I'll return it to its natural habitat.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Nature's balance can get bungled up if
you release an insect into a new habitat.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Beedle's policy is to take care of nature
so nature can take care of bugs.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}sunset firefly{{color id="-1"}}?! Your loss is Beedle's
gain!{{delay15}} Ooo... Want to know the secret to
their glorious glow?
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Those mysterious twinkles are caused by
two chemicals inside the firefly reacting
with each other.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Beedle glows all by himself. No special
chemicals necessary!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Aieee! A {{color id="0"}}restless cricket{{color id="-1"}}! {{delay15}}Now I'll just

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I think {{number2 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of those would be worth
about {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. Is that OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I think {{number2 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of those would be worth
about {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. Is that OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Just one, then? That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}
rupees{{color id="-1"}}, please.

label: Com_Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Just one? How about {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Talk_34

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}All of them?{{delay8}} Well, {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them will be
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. How does that sound?

---
label: Com_Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}So that's {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}? Which is all of them!
That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
How does that sound?
