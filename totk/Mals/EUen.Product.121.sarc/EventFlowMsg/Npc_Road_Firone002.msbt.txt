I hope they're OK.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey there. {{delay8}}You're a bit late, hm?

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! {{delay8}}You're {{delay8}}not a member of the monster-
control crew.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Sorry. {{delay15}}We just formed, so I'm not overly
familiar with everyone's faces.

label: Talk_0002_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh, hello. {{delay8}}You just passing through?{{pageBreak}}Squad one of the monster-control crew,
led by {{color id="0"}}Hoz{{color id="-1"}}, is about to engage with some
monsters near here.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you can't hold your own in a fight,
I'd advise you to stay away.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}As we speak, squad one of the monster-
control crew—led by {{color id="0"}}Hoz{{color id="-1"}}—{{delay8}}is carrying out
a mission nearby.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you {{color id="0"}}go south on that road{{color id="-1"}},{{delay15}} you can
see them in action. They're assaulting a
monster stronghold!

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'm just here for logistical support—
tending to the horses, making elixirs.

Come to think of it...{{delay15}}I did make some
extra elixir. Why don't you take some?
Might come in handy during your travels.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Candidly, I'm a little worried about this
mission. The new members didn't get
much in the way of training.
I wish {{color id="0"}}someone with experience fighting
monsters {{color id="-1"}}was there to help out.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh!{{delay15}} Your pouch is full.{{delay8}} Well, it never
hurts to be prepared.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The monster-control crew was only
created recently, {{delay8}}so a lot of the members
aren't used to fighting monsters.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'd be more confident if {{color id="0"}}someone with
fighting experience {{color id="-1"}}was there to help.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I still have more of the elixir I prepared.{{delay8}}
Please have some if you like.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh, hello! {{delay8}}Lovely morning, isn't it?

---
label: Talk_0101_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Taking a break from your travels?

---
label: Talk_0101_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh! {{delay8}}You're out late. Can't be easy,
traveling in this darkness.

---
label: Talk_0101_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, hello! {{delay8}}Crummy weather we're having
today, isn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Hoz's squad of the monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}}
is out on a mission nearby.{{delay8}} Be careful
you don't get caught in the crossfire.

---
label: Talk_0103
---
Hoz is taking them to {{color id="0"}}Fort Hateno{{color id="-1"}}, which
is {{color id="0"}}to the east {{color id="-1"}}along that road.

They're planning to get rid of the
monsters who set up a stronghold there.

---
label: Talk_0104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've been helping them out by taking
care of the horses and making elixirs.

Thing is, I was so worried about them
coming back safe and sound that I made
waaay too much.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You want to take some? I'm sure it'll
come in handy during your travels.

---
label: Talk_0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The squad's got some experience under
their belts now, but those monsters
they're up against look pretty tough.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wish someone {{color id="0"}}with fighting skills {{color id="-1"}}would
give them a little extra help.

---
label: Talk_0201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The monsters we're fighting have seen
a lot of battles. I think it'll be OK, but you
never know.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It'd be nice if someone {{color id="0"}}confident in their
monster-fighting abilities {{color id="-1"}}was there to
help out.

---
label: Talk_0202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We're actually taking back a fort that
used to be ours, so we know the terrain.
That should give us an advantage.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Still, you never know. I wish someone with
{{color id="0"}}fighting skills {{color id="-1"}}was there to make sure we
come out on top.
