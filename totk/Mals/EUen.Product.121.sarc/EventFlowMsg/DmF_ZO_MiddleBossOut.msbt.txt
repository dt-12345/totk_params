{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoAizuchi_01"}}You did it, Link! Take that, foul beast of
the sludge!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Is everyone all right?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoImpressed_00"}}Thank goodness.{{delay15}} Lady Yona, if something
had happened to you...{{delay15}} I...

Ahem, in any case, it is possible that
another monster will appear. I suggest
that you return to the domain at once.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Thank you for the sentiment, Sidon.
However, more importantly, we must
consider what Sir Link spoke of earlier.
The pillar of light that he said appeared
at the reservoir begs to be investigated.

This may be our opportunity to learn the
cause of the sludge falling from the sky
or even Princess Zelda's whereabouts.
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Leave this place to us, dearest Sidon.
Your friend needs your help getting to
the bottom of this mystery.

your heart.

your beloved domain.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I can see right through you, whether you
want me to or not. You are yielding to the
fear of losing someone you love again.
You must overcome your past and face
whatever the future holds with courage.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Hee-hee...


It seems Sidon has finally put his doubts
behind him and returned to his usual
fearless self. I am so glad.

label: Dm_ZO_0010_49

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}All this time he was clinging to regret over
being unable to save his precious sister,
Mipha... My poor, tormented Sidon.
And to think he was unknowingly
paralyzed from taking action because
he feared losing me as well...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Yet he has overcome this trial and placed
his faith in me. At last, the Sidon I know
and love has come back to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Link...{{delay15}} Please take good care of my
dear Sidon. He is the sun in my sky.
