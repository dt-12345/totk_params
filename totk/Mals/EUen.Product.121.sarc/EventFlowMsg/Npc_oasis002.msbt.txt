{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq"}}Vasaaq...


I sell arrows, and I sell Chuchu jelly.
What do you think? A pretty sensible
combination, right?

label: GreetingAfter03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq"}}Vasaaq...


Given the choice between indoors and
outdoors, it's far better to test fire
arrows outside.

What? A voe?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Are you surprised to see such a hip shop
being run by someone my age?

I heard the new big thing is attaching
all kinds of stuff to arrows before you
shoot them...
As a merchant, I've got to embrace
the popular trends with open arms.{{delay15}}
However...
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Under no circumstances will I introduce
a voe to my granddaughters!

Voe bring nothing but misfortune to
young Gerudo!

label: talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What? I haven't had a chance to restock
any of my items yet.

That should be plenty obvious just from
looking at the display. Hang on...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Are you here to meet my granddaughters?
Was I not clear before?

You may be the chief's guest, but a voe
is still bad luck to young Gerudo!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It really is nice to be back out under
the sun again. This view is what makes
Gerudo Town so special.
And there should be more customers too.
Now's the time to really go all out!

I heard the new big thing is attaching all
kinds of stuff to arrows before you shoot
them, so I've really stocked up.
You don't see a shop this hip very often,
am I right?

I've realized I need to be more accepting
of change.{{delay15}} And that includes accepting
voe like you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We Gerudo are open-minded enough
