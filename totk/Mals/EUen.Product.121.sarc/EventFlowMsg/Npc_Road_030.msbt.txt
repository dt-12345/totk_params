This time I'll do it!

label: Balloon_Evening

I felt so clueless.

Hm.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hey, wait!{{delay8}} Are you headed to Gerudo
Canyon too?{{pageBreak}}If you are, just know the guard up ahead
will give you a test.

label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Are you headed to Gerudo Canyon too?{{pageBreak}}Just know that after you've crossed the
bridge, the guard up ahead is gonna give
you a test.

---
label: 1000
---
Test?

---
label: 1001
---
I'm in a hurry.

---
label: Common_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That's right. All the questions are about
how to deal with hot and cold weather.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}But no matter how many times I try,{{delay8}}
I can't seem to pass.

---
label: Common_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I thought I at least had the basics down—
splashing yourself with water to cool
down, stuff like that.

---
label: Shiny_DegudoToGate
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Anyway, I was studying all night, so I'm
sure I'll get it right today!

---
label: Rain_DegudoToGate
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Which reminds me, did you know there's
no rain in Gerudo Canyon?{{pageBreak}}How can you splash yourself with water
when there's no water?! It boggles and
bends the mind!

---
label: Shiny_GateToDegudo
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But clearly, I'm not prepared enough.
I better get back to studying.

---
label: Rain_GateToDegudo
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}But I still failed, and now, I'm wet. I'm a
wet failure.

---
label: InTent
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Like, did you know that caves stay the
same cool temperature all day and night?{{pageBreak}}Me neither! I just learned that...which
doesn't bode well for the test.

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I see! {{delay8}}Sorry to hold you up.

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh, so you want to hear about the test
after all?

---
label: 1002
---
That's right.

---
label: 1003
---
Nope.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Are your studies going well, fella?
{{delay8}}Boy, are mine ever not.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I know you can pour water on yourself to
keep cool for a while, but that's it. That's
all I seem to retain.

---
label: Passed_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh, come on! You passed the test?!
That's not fair!

---
label: Passed_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}What is it, you test passer? Are you here
to gloat?

room for you here.
