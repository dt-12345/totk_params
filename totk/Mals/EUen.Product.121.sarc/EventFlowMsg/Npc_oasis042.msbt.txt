Show them our real power!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you've got something to say, please
make it quick.

After our humbling {{color id="0"}}first encounter {{color id="-1"}}with
the Gibdos, I realized that we needed to
establish a {{color id="0"}}new unit{{color id="-1"}} to combat them.
The new unit is in the middle of training.
They need to get into fighting shape fast
since the enemy could strike at any time...

---
label: talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Gibdos may be preparing to attack as
we speak.

The {{color id="0"}}new unit{{color id="-1"}} needs to be ready to meet
them in battle. Otherwise, it'll be like the
{{color id="0"}}first encounter{{color id="-1"}} all over again...

---
label: 1001
---
First encounter?

---
label: talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah. The first time we fought the
Gibdos, they had us on our heels the
whole time...
Numbers and strength were on their side.
The best we could do was an organized
retreat to protect the civilians...
Most of the guards that held the Gibdos
off are still recovering from their injuries.

Hopefully this {{color id="0"}}new unit {{color id="-1"}}can help us
avenge our comrades and return to the
surface. But first they must finish training.

---
label: 1002
---
What's the new unit?

---
label: talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, the Gibdos did a serious number on
us before.

It was so bad that some of the guards
who fought in the {{color id="0"}}first encounter{{color id="-1"}} are
still recovering from their wounds.
I believe that partly has to do with how
hard it is to protect yourself while using a
spear. Both hands are full, you see.
So I've established a new unit that will
use a sword and {{color id="0"}}shield{{color id="-1"}} instead. They can
better guard themselves that way.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}In that first encounter... Well, if {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}}
hadn't been there with her {{color id="0"}}control of
lightning{{color id="-1"}}, we might have been wiped out.
All the more reason to get the new unit
ready. We have to keep {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}} safe.

---
label: talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I hear there's some kind of strange event
going on around {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.

Tch... We need to get the new sword-and-
shield unit trained ready for action.

---
label: talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Voe!


If you need something, talk to me!


I don't want you getting in the way of the
sword-and-shield unit, OK?

---
label: talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's fine if you're going to fight alongside
us. Just try not to get in the way.

The best thing to do is make sure all our
defenses are ready for what's coming.

---
label: talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'd wanted to attach {{color id="0"}}electricity-emitting
material {{color id="-1"}}to our weapons, kind of like Lady
Riju's ability...
But they're rare, valuable items that have
to be taken from {{color id="0"}}Electric Lizalfos{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}So instead, we'll try using {{color id="0"}}materials that
generate fire{{color id="-1"}}. Maybe those will work?
Here's hoping...

---
label: talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Haha! It looks like the flames are pretty
effective! We'll burn up these monsters!

---
label: talk26
---
We did it!

---
label: talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}That was a brilliant battle! {{delay8}}Everyone did
their part to keep the town safe!

I'm especially proud of our new sword-
and-shield unit. The idea, and the hard
work of those guards, paid off...

---
label: talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll have to treat everyone in the new unit
to a drink at the canteen. They've earned
it, that's for sure.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Wait... {{delay15}}What am I saying? We're not done.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}While we've successfully defended the
town, we aren't out of danger yet.

Make sure you don't lose focus either!

---
label: talk27
---
Time for that drink!

---
label: talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure, we've saved the town, driven off
the Gibdos, and the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} has
passed... But we cannot relax!
Or at least, we cannot completely relax...

---
label: talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But after learning an entirely new way to
fight, all the members of our new sword-
and-shield unit deserve a little break.
I'll invite them all to meet at the canteen
soon! It'll be my treat!
