An enormous monster...

---
label: Talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hiiiyeeee! I'm so happyyy we can work
together once again!

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wouldn't mind trying my hand at another
large sculpture.

---
label: Talk44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}In that case, I'd looove for you to
make a {{color id="0"}}Frox{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Truth be told, when it comes to the Frox,
I've only heard secondhand stories.

But I'm told its body is knoblobbity
with bumps and lumps, and quite
GABAAANTIC in size.
Its gaping mouth goes NUMMAMMUM,
and it's got biiig tusks too!

And finally, it's said the Frox lives deep
down in the vast dark places.

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Big monster, small monster...if I have a
{{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}} of the thing, I can make 
a sculpture of it.

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Heeheeyaha, your enthusiasm for the {{color id="0"}}Frox{{color id="-1"}}
fills me with gladness!{{delay8}} I will tell you allll
about it as many times as you like!

---
label: 0001
---
Check out this picture.

---
label: 0013
---
Which monster?

---
label: 0002
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: 0010
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? Didn't I already make a sculpture of
this monster?

---
label: Talk68
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huu...{{delay8}} Hayooo!{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}Look! A knoblobbity body! And that BIG
mouth! That's a Frox all right.

Thank you! Thank you!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whawaaa!{{delay15}} Fahahaaa!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


Th-this is it! This is the {{color id="0"}}Frox{{color id="-1"}} I've been
desiring!

---
label: Talk72
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}*sigh* I hope I'll be able to add a Frox sculpture
to my collection too.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}M-may we borrow it?

---
label: 0003
---
Go ahead.

---
label: 0004
---
I'll pick a different one.

---
label: 0005
---
Sorry, but no.

---
label: Talk40
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Daaaaaa!{{delay8}} Oh no!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I had that picture, the sculpture would
be son and done. But...I can't force you.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Just leave it to me. I'll have it made
before you can say "son and done."

---
label: Talk16
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha-hiyoot!{{size value="100"}}


It's astounding! And overwhelming! This
sculpture could stun even the boldest
beholder into silence!

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It was nothing.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Dawww... If only someone would place it
on the stage in a flattering spot.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We went to all that trouble to get the
sculpture made.

I want nothing more than to give it the
many looking eyeballs it deserves.

---
label: 0006
---
I found a nice spot for it.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hwaaah?! What did you say?

---
label: Talk26
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ooh! OOOOOOH!{{size value="100"}}


I'm stunned! Stunned! I'd prance around
on all fours. But...I'm stunned!

Oh, look at me. My legs are all wabobbly
with excitement. Vivid, so vivid! This is
a Frox!
And made so tastefully. It's just as perfect
as I dreamed it would be!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}True! It looks so real, even I'm a little
worried it might take a snap at me.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes! Now let's put it before every face
in the village.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!


This is the rarely sighted Frox!


But do not fear, draw near! This is the
only place you can safely admire such
a monster up close. The only place!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Goodness me! Who knew monsters got
that big?

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}*ahem* This sight has stolen your eyes.
Now, give me your ears! All of them!

Once again, this monster with the
foreboding look is called a Frox.

Gobbles up all it sees! And sees all that
it wants to gobble!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, but if it saw you! You'd be INTO its
mouth and DOWN its gullet in no time
at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And yet...{{delay15}}the ore on its back twinkles
and sparkles in the dark depths of the
earth. It must be quite mesmerizing...
I'd love put my eyeballs upon it just once.
But no, I don't suggest you try it. It could
be the last thing your eyeballs ever see.

label: Talk34

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Goddess save us all...

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
Understand what you fear and you'll
feel great!
For those with an open mind, wonders
always await!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!


Seeing the Frox right here, like this...
I'm happy beyond happy.

Here's a gift for all that you've done.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Use this with your favorite horse. It goes
with the things I gave you before.

And this is for you too, as usual.

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You've helped make my dream come true.
To build a collection of monsters from
around the world...to share them with all! 
To show people that monsters are
people toooo!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!

---
label: Talk85
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Oh phooey! Your pouch is so fully full!


I've got monster extract to give you, but
first you'll have to make room to carry it.

---
label: Talk86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hooyagee?! {{delay8}}I was going to give you
a thank-you gift, but that pouch of
yours is full.
Make some room in there and I'll give
you the monster extract that's waiting
for you.
