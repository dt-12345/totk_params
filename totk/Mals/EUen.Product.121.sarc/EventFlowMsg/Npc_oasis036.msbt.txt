{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You can't be serious.{{delay15}} Do you really think I
would open the door for the likes of you?

Get out of my sight!

Is that Ploka?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Nothing to report...{{delay15}} Hm?

label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wha— A voe?!{{delay8}} Did you come here to
escape the sand shroud?!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, you've reached the entrance to
the Gerudo {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}}.

But I cannot allow any {{color id="0"}}voe {{color id="-1"}}to pass
through this door.

Voe?

label: 0001

Sorry, "boe"?

---
label: talk0004

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! You've never heard that word?{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}Voe{{color id="-1"}} means "{{color id="0"}}man{{color id="-1"}}" in Gerudo.

label: talk0008

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}No, "voe." With a V!{{delay8}} Bite your lower lip
when you say it! "Voe"!{{delay15}}

{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}I have had to explain this so many times since I

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="0"}}Voe{{color id="-1"}} means "{{color id="0"}}man{{color id="-1"}}" in Gerudo.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There is a custom—really more of a law—
that we Gerudo follow.

Young Gerudo are generally not allowed
to interact with {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What's wrong? What's going on?

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A voe wandered in here...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?! Did you say "voe"?!

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}There's nothing to worry about.{{delay8}} The voe
is very short and can't even reach the
{{color id="0"}}peepholes{{color id="-1"}} in the door.
He's out of sight, and even on his tiptoes,
he won't be able to see in.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Normally, voe aren't allowed to even set
foot within the walls of {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}...

But this is a unique situation...


{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}So as long as you keep out of the {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}},
I'll overlook your presence in town.

If you're looking for some place to get out
of the sand shroud, you can rest in one of
the houses on the surface.

label: Talk_PreChallenge03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Gerudo {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}} is beyond here...{{delay8}}
It doesn't matter how many times you
ask—I won't open the door for a {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}}.
Between keeping watch for intruders and
checking on the interior of the shelter
with those {{color id="0"}}peepholes{{color id="-1"}}, I'm very busy.
So please stop bothering me.

---
label: 0002

I'll go.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm? I thought we talked about this. Did
you forget already?

{{color id="0"}}Voe{{color id="-1"}} means "{{color id="0"}}man{{color id="-1"}}" in Gerudo.

label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}No, "voe." With a V!{{delay8}} Bite your lower lip
when you say it! "Voe"!{{delay15}}

It's important to know this, because {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}}
means "{{color id="0"}}man{{color id="-1"}}" in Gerudo.

{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}I have had to explain this so many times since I

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You...{{delay8}}still don't get it, do you?
In that case...

---
label: talk0013

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I'll whack it into your thick skull with my
spear!{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}Voe{{color id="-1"}} means "{{color id="0"}}man{{color id="-1"}}" in Gerudo!{{delay8}}
Got it?!

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}OK, how about I show you how to do it
with my spear!{{delay8}} It's "vo," not "bo"! Got it?!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}It is against the law for young Gerudo to
interact with voe.

So hurry up and get out of here.

---
label: talk0017

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What is a {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}} like you doing here?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Maybe you're looking to escape the
sand shroud? Well, beyond this point is
the Gerudo {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}}.
And no voe are allowed there.
Wait a second...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You fought well against the Gibdos.


I'm glad you're all right. It would have
been unacceptable for an important guest
of Lady Riju, even a {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}}, to be injured.
You may pass through here. Get some
rest, and recover after such a fierce
battle.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The idea of a {{color id="0"}}voe{{color id="-1"}} walking around the

what the chief wants, after all.
