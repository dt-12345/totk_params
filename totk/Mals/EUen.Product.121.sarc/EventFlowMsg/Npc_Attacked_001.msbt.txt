{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I keep hearing about the stylish clothes
they make in Hateno Village.

Take it from me—{{delay8}}you can't underestimate
the power of a good wardrobe.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I used to be a total wallflower. Then I
learned how to dress myself, and boom—
I was a new woman!
Maybe you should go to Hateno Village
and try a new look for yourself.

It's located on the far side of Necluda
in southeast Hyrule.

Never know! Might change your life.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you want trendy clothes, Hateno Village
is the place to go.

It's on the far side of Necluda, over there
in southeast Hyrule.

Why not check it out? You might be
surprised what a new outfit can do!

---
label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm traveling all over to learn what I can
about the latest trends.

Fashion never stops moving, see. I've got
to constantly work to keep up or I risk
getting left behind.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Come to think of it, there are people from
all over at Lookout Landing right now,
south of Hyrule Castle.
Might be a good place to learn the latest
fashion news—{{delay8}}or any other kind of news,
for that matter.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Guess that'll be my next stop!

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You're not much of a talker, are you?


Well, if you like listening, I hear Lookout
Landing's a good place to pick up all sorts
of info. It's just south of Hyrule Castle.
I might go myself—{{delay8}}see what I learn about
the latest fashion trends.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Aren't you afraid of monsters?


No matter how confident I am now, I still
cringe whenever I see a monster...

They just don't care how stylish you are!


When monsters are nearby, move carefully
to avoid their attention.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Are you avoiding the rain too?


Getting wet is the worst!{{delay8}} The rain is awful
for clothes.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}But get this—I heard there's a shop in
Hateno Village{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}that'll re-dye your outfits.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Hateno is on the far side of Necluda in
southeast Hyrule. It's not exactly close.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But it's THE place to go if your outfit
fades or you want to freshen up your look.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard there's a shop in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}

Hateno is on the far side of Necluda,
which is pretty far from here.

But it's a must for anyone who cares
about fashion. And I definitely care.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A shop that can dye your clothes a new
color...{{delay8}} I'd like to go at least once.

It's on the far side of Necluda in
southeastern Hyrule, so I'll have to
travel quite a ways.
But once I'm done here, I think I might
make the trip.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hey, are you looking for {{color id="0"}}Misko's

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh.{{delay8}} Bye.

label: GoRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah...{{delay8}} It refers to the {{color id="0"}}clothes {{color id="-1"}}hidden by
the {{color id="0"}}Great Bandit Misko{{color id="-1"}} ages ago.

There's a rumor that the treasure is
hidden in a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}near here.

As someone with a keen eye for fashion,
obviously I'd like to get my hands on it...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} probably have monsters in
them. And how am I supposed to deal
with that, huh?

But going into a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}takes courage that
