{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}The sludge!{{delay8}} That ghastly sludge!


{{anim type="Sad_01"}}My friend Tona was buried in the stuff.{{delay8}}
Thankfully she was rescued, but she is
covered in that muck even still.
The look of suffering on her face when
they carried her to the infirmary...{{delay8}}
I fear we will all end up like that.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Oh, my sweet prince...{{delay8}} If only I could have
spoken with you Zora-to-Zora just once
before the final curtain!

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}We will probably all become sullied
and meet our end because of that
awful sludge!
{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Oh, my sweet Prince Sidon...{{delay8}} If only I
could have spoken with you Zora-to-Zora
just once before the final curtain!

Prince Sidon...

I must know...

label: talk0029

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}*siiigh* {{delay8}}I simply can't stop sighing.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I've been{{delay8}} staring at the throne room...{{delay15}}
I mean, {{delay8}}protecting the throne room...
for ages now.
{{anim type="Think_01"}}But these days, I never catch sight of
Prince Sidon!

I know that he is doing some kind of
important work at Mipha Court, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* I would even brave a bit of sludge
for just a momentary peek at our prince!

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Maybe I should just mosey over to
Mipha Court for a bit. You know,
see how he's doing.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Oh, who am I kidding... {{delay8}}I have no
believable reason to speak with him.

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}How fun that the children are playing a
secret game in the throne room.

It kind of seems like they're pretending to
be King Dorephan. I'm curious as to what
sort of things they're speaking about...

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}They're pretending to be King Dorephan
in the throne room.{{delay15}} I would be lying if I
said I wasn't curious about their game.

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Correct. {{delay8}}They insist their game is a secret
and won't allow any adults to get near.

They say {{color id="0"}}King Dorephan {{color id="-1"}}himself told them
not to tell anybody.

{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I must know what the secret is!


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}After all, if it truly is about {{color id="0"}}King Dorephan{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
I'm sure Prince Sidon would want to be
privy as well.
If I catch wind of something,{{delay8}} I could use it
as an excuse to talk to...{{delay15}} I mean, {{delay8}}I could
dutifully tell Prince Sidon about it!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Hm. {{delay15}}But even when I accidentally stray
near there,{{delay8}} they quickly shoo me away.

Ledo was merely cleaning the throne
room, and he was chased out as well.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I wonder if there's any way to covertly
listen in on their game...

---
label: talk0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}OK... {{delay8}}Be safe out there.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Ugh, I really need to know what this
King Dorephan game is all about...

King Dorephan?

label: 0021
---
Bye!

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It looks like Tona is on the mend!


I'm sooo happy! What a relief!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Not even the sludge has the power to
break up the Prince Sidon fan club!

---
label: talk0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's not just Tona either. The Zora
soldiers are in much better shape
as well.
Lady Yona did incredible work, as always!

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I hear that Prince Sidon is going on
some kind of trip. Into the sky, if I
heard correctly.
That makes this the perfect time {{delay15}}for the
Prince Sidon fan club{{delay8}} to help Lady Yona,
who will be all alone while he's away!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}It's too bad that Tona is still recuperating{{delay8}}
and Laruta is obsessed with figuring out
what the Zora children are up to.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I know I'm the president of our club and
all, but...{{delay15}}without anyone to preside over,
all I can do is fold my fins in prayer.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I, Tula, {{delay8}}president of the Prince Sidon fan
club,{{delay15}} will pray with all of my heart,{{delay8}} for the
salvation of the domain!

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Dear Prince Sidon...{{delay8}}and kind Lady Yona...


{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Oh, please, please, please... {{delay8}}I pray for
their safety and that of Zora's Domain!

---
label: near0001
---
For King Sidon...

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, Link!


You rescued our precious King Sidon{{delay8}} and
saved the entire domain!

On behalf of the King Sidon fan club,
thank you so much for all that you have
done for the Zora!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Now that all of that awfulness is settled,{{delay8}}
we can finally get back to what matters—
discussing how wonderful King Sidon is!

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}When the sludge first started falling,{{delay8}}
King Sidon started cleaning the domain
at once.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}He secured a fresh water source for us
all by himself...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}He handled the investigation of the
stone slate...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_00"}}He vanquished the sludge monster that
appeared at Mipha Court...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}AND he journeyed into the sky itself to
stop the sludge at its source!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}What a hero! What admirable deeds!


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}We truly could never praise him enough...{{delay15}}
but endeavoring to do just that is the
prime mission of the King Sidon fan club!

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So...{{delay8}}I've been thinking.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Everyone in the King Sidon fan club
should strive to re-create the experience
of King Sidon's adventure for ourselves.
By that I mean, we must swim to the
ruins in the sky!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I will play the role of King Sidon, though
his fins are impossible to fill, of course.
And Tona will play as you, Link.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Laruta will play our fair Queen Yona. This
is an important undertaking! Ah, but that
means she can't leave the domain...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}The King Sidon fan-club meeting is going
to start without me if I don't hurry.

It is unacceptable for the president to
be tardy!

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}King Sidon...{{delay8}} He really is sooo noble.
And handsome. So handsome it's noble,
in fact.
*sigh* I really need to discuss this
important point with the other members
of the King Sidon fan club...

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, Link!


You rescued our precious King Sidon{{delay8}} and
saved the entire domain!

On behalf of the King Sidon fan club,
thank you so much for all that you have
done for the Zora!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Now that all of that awfulness is settled,
we can finally get back to what matters—
discussing how wonderful King Sidon is!

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm. {{delay8}}Come to think of it...


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You are in a very enviable position.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You were graced with the opportunity{{delay8}} to
journey with King Sidon to that place...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You have spent quality with him here...


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}And there as well...


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Do not get me wrong,{{delay8}} I am not saying I'm
jealous or anything. I'm just...{{delay15}}envious.{{delay8}}
It's different! Really!

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I was thinking about King Sidon.


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}And got so absorbed, {{delay8}}I couldn't sleep.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I mostly just wander around at night.{{delay8}}
I am essentially a nocturnal creature at
this point.

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I finished my training for today.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I did a lot of imagination training, so I'm
sure I will be able to meet King Sidon in
my dreams!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Sorry, but please excuse me.{{delay8}} I have a
dream date with King Sidon soon, so I
must get to sleep at once.
