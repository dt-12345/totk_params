{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're up early, buddy. I wake up early
every day too, so I can start guard duty!

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since my dad works far away, I make sure
to guard the village every day.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}They say even monsters need their sleep.
That's why I'm OK standing down at night.

label: Talk_10

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It takes real concentration to do guard
duty while it's raining!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}The road gets slippery in the rain,
so be careful.

Then I'll give you the gatekeeper's

{{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} to go search for Ms. Zelda
at a place called Lookout Landing.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}But don't worry! Me and my mom are
