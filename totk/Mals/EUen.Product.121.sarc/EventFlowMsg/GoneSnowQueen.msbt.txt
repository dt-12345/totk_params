{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You startled me.{{delay8}} How'd you make it
all the way here in the blizzard? Are
you a shield surfer too? Must be!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You might not think it by the look of me
these days, but I used to be a pro
shield surfer. Kind of well-known too.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I'd earned myself the impressive
nickname "Duchess of Downhill."{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Oh, hey. I'm starting to think you came
here to study shield surfing from me.{{delay8}}
Am I right?

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Can't believe you got all the way out
here through the blizzard.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}You have something you want to ask
the Duchess of Downhill?

---
label: Talk02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh? {{delay15}}Got a question for the Duchess
of Downhill?

---
label: 0001
---
What's a shield surfer?

---
label: 0002

Make me your student!

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Something else you want to ask?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Maybe you're not here for advanced
study, then... OK, here's the basic idea
behind shield surfing...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Take your favorite shield and turn
it into a way to slide down snowy
mountains with grace!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I left the pro side of shield surfing behind
to help the next generation step up, using
this lodge as a teaching center.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But shield surfing in this weather is
nearly impossible to do safely.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So I've put off teaching my students
until the blizzard stops.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heh. I knew you'd be interested.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But sorry. I have two students.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If I take a third, I'd worry they wouldn't
get as much training as they deserve.
So, I can't take you on right now.

---
label: Talk04_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heh.{{delay8}} I like your attitude, asking again.
Becoming a great shield surfer takes
passion and commitment.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But no.{{delay15}} I've got to train the two students
I have now before I can take on more.
It'd be unfair to them to take on a third.

---
label: Talk04_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I'd be glad to watch you surf the
mountain sometime.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So, come back once this blizzard stops.
Then we'll have good conditions for shield
surfing. I'd like to see what you can do.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Right, goodbye. But keep in mind
that it's dangerous around here in
the blizzard.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Feel free to get some rest in the lodge
before you set off.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be sure to return to show me your skills,
just after this blizzard ends.

---
label: Talk06_00
---
Guess that's all you want to know.

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's dangerous around here in the
blizzard. Feel free to rest in the lodge
before you head out.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}And return here to show me your
shield-surfing skills after this blizzard
finally ends.

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hey, maaan!{{delay8}} You come here to do some
shield surfing?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Or maybe{{delay8}} to ask Selmie if she'd take
you on as a student, like us?

---
label: Talk07_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard you talkin' to Selmie.{{delay15}} Sounds
like you want her to take you on as a
student too?

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Then you're one of us! Or, uh, I wish.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Be great to have ya, but Selmie is
stoppin' at two students right now.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, she said she wants to give us two
her focus. She's not gonna add any more
students for now.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hard to complain 'bout that though.
She's one dedicated teacher to give us
all her attention.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I bet once we prove that we've learned
enough, she'll take more students.

But this blizzard...{{delay15}} We can't train in this
weather, so we can't learn our way to
mastering what's she's got to teach!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'd say just get off the mountain for
now.{{delay8}} Wait for this snow...{{delay8}}to cut out all
this snowin'.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Come back when the blizzard's over,
maaan. Then we can get down to some
shield surfing—rad times all around.
Maybe by then, the two of us will be good
enough to prove we've learned lots from
Selmie...{{delay8}}so she'll teach you too.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sounds like Teach won't take more
students. At least, until the blizzard cuts
it out or something.
Just get off Mount Hebra, and wait till
then. When you're out there, keep an eye
out for flags on the mountain.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}There's flint and firewood under 'em
to help shield surfers stay warm. Use
'em as you descend, yeah?

Where's Selmie at?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Coach?!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh...{{delay15}} Hi, sorry. Thought ya were our
coach, Selmie.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Uh... Know her?


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Selmie used to be a shield surfer, real
pro level. Went by the name "Duchess of
Downhill."{{delay8}} Heard of that maybe?
Anyway, she's taken me and my best
bud on as students, but then...

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Coach?!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh...{{delay15}}it's you. Sorry. The thing is that
our coach, uh...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It all started so good, ya see! She said
she was going out to build out a new
course on the slopes somewhere!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But she's still not back. {{delay8}}I'm worried sick.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Me and my best bud Fin figured she'd
gone to the {{color id="0"}}Biron Snowshelf in the west{{color id="-1"}}.
He set off to find her.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm waiting here in case she comes
back.{{delay8}} But now...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Fin hasn't come back either. It's been
too long. Maybe he found her. Maybe
not.{{delay15}} I dunno.
I've been watching for him to send up
{{color id="0"}}smoke signals{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} That way I'd go wherever
he is. We'd help Coach from there.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Selmie—that's our coach—has gotta be in
trouble out there somewhere.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Fin's out searching but hasn't come back.
Maybe it's about time I go to {{color id="0"}}Biron
Snowshelf in the west{{color id="-1"}} too.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There are two flags on the right as you
go out of the lodge.{{delay8}} Fin went down the
mountain from there.{{pageBreak}}I think he might have gone off to the deep
valley, one mountain over to the west.{{pageBreak}}He said he'd send up a {{color id="0"}}smoke signal{{color id="-1"}}
when he got to where he was going, so
I'd know how to find him.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But now it's been so long for them both.{{delay8}}
I'm gonna stay here longer and wait for
Selmie—in case she comes back.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk17_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Selmie... {{delay15}}I wonder if she's in trouble
somewhere.

Fin hasn't come back either. {{delay8}}Maybe I
should head to the {{color id="0"}}Biron Snowshelf in
the west{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk17_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ah, I getcha... {{delay15}}You met Fin,{{delay8}} but not
Selmie yet, huh?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Maybe she'll see if Fin sends up a
smoke signal there. Maybe she won't.
Or maybe she's injured.
She might even be stuck somewhere...{{delay8}}
I dunno...{{delay8}}in a {{color id="0"}}place where she can't
even see his smoke signal{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk17_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wonder where...{{delay15}}Selmie is? If Fin's sent
up a smoke signal for her to find...

Maybe she's injured and can't get there.
Or maybe she's in a place where {{color id="0"}}she
can't see the smoke signal{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Coach?!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh...I thought you were someone else.{{delay15}}
Sorry. Hi.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}You know our coach, Selmie?

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Ah, I getcha, I getcha...{{delay15}} You heard what's
up from my best bud, Fin.

I gotta wonder where Selmie went...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'd go in search of her too, but maybe I
should stay in case she makes her way
back here.

---
label: Talk18_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wonder if Coach Selmie...{{delay15}}is in bad
trouble somewhere.{{delay15}}

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?!{{delay15}} You found Coach? She's alive, but
she's stuck in a cave?{{pageBreak}}I have to go rescue her, but...{{delay15}}how's
that gonna work out?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If Selmie got stuck going in the entrance,
we'll get stuck following her. Can't come
back the same way.
We need a path from where she is, one
{{color id="0"}}that gets ya out a different way{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}So, Selmie's stuck in a cave and can't
get out the same way... We gotta rescue
her somehow.{{delay15}}
If she couldn't get back out through the
entrance, {{delay8}}we'll get stuck going the same
way too.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}What we need is a {{color id="0"}}path that gets ya out
a different way {{color id="-1"}}from where she is. That'd
do it.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hey, you...{{delay15}} Happen to bump into a Hylian
named {{color id="0"}}Selmie {{color id="-1"}}around here?

Maybe you've heard of her. Famous
shield surfer? Called the "Duchess of
Downhill" back in the day?
Anyway, she retired and took me and
my buddy on as students. She's been
teaching out of this area.

---
label: Talk52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just recently, Selmie said she was
going to build a new course for us to
really push our shield-surfing skills.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}She set off for that slope. But then...
she disappeared.{{delay8}} Me and my buddy
haven't been able to find her.

---
label: Talk52_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}She used to be a pro shield surfer. So
you'd think she could shred her way out
of any situation up here.
Now I think she might be in trouble.{{delay8}}
There were traces of shield surfing on
a slope nearby.
I followed those all over the place...{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The traces of surfing in the snow {{color id="0"}}cut off
around this area{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}Still, I haven't found
her anywhere.
I followed the tracks again and again,
but no sign of Selmie. I had no choice
for now but to stop looking.

---
label: Talk52_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But I couldn't do nothing. I'm sendin' up
a smoke signal now, hopin' she sees it
if she's near here.
I'm losin' hope though. It's been a long
time that I've been at it.{{delay8}} You'd think she'd
have seen the smoke by now.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe,{{delay8}} just maybe,{{delay8}} the problem is she
can't move, or maybe she's {{color id="0"}}somewhere
she can't see the smoke signal{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk52_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm sendin' up a smoke signal. Hopefully
Selmie or my best buddy Russ sees it.
He's back at her lodge on Hebra Peak.
You'd think that if Selmie was here, she
would have seen the smoke by now.
But nope, nothing.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe she's here but can't move?{{delay8}} Or
maybe...{{delay8}}she's stuck in a place {{color id="0"}}where she
can't see the smoke signal{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The traces of Selmie's shield surfing
got {{color id="0"}}cut off around this area{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} but I can't
find her anywhere.
I thought she might see the smoke
signal and know I'm right here.{{delay8}} But
not yet, nope.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Maybe she can't move, or maybe she's
stuck somewhere {{color id="0"}}she can't see the smoke

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?!{{delay15}} You found Teach?{{delay15}} She can't get

shield surfing, huh? You gotta admire
Teach for being THAT extreme.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But yeah, best to get down to rescuin'
her, soon as we can.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}S'pose if we head into that cave through
the entrance, we can't expect to get back
out the same way.
Could there be a {{color id="0"}}different path that gets
you out{{color id="-1"}} from where she is? Maybe.

---
label: Talk24

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}How can we rescue Teach, who's back
in that cave somewhere?{{delay15}}

We can't count on gettin' back out
through the entrance.{{delay8}} We'll be just as
stuck as Selmie.
{{anim type="Sad"}}We need to find some sort of path from
where she's stuck in there—a {{color id="0"}}different

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That terrible blizzard stopped, so I took
advantage of the weather to go out and
create a new course for my students.
And then I found this cave—just surfed
right into it on my shield. Can't blame an

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I went in too far though, where the cave
got all closed off. I couldn't climb back
out the way I came in.
Worse yet, I heard rocks falling back up
at the entrance. Thought it'd collapse
at some point.
I was staaarting to think I'd be stuck
