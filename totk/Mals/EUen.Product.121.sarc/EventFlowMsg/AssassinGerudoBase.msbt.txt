{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Hey, um, so... I heard that I could learn
this really {{color id="0"}}cool move {{color id="-1"}}here. I think it's
called the "{{color id="0"}}Earthwake technique{{color id="-1"}}"?

label: Talk_0002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}Get lost. {{delay15}}Only Yiga Clan members may
enter this place.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}And I want to join you! I heard you guys
could teach me some {{color id="0"}}cool moves{{color id="-1"}} that'd
have everyone swooning over me!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh? G-go away? I don't get a hint about
where the {{color id="0"}}branches {{color id="-1"}}are{{delay8}} or even a peek at
what the Yiga Clan {{color id="0"}}wears{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Hey, come on. You've got to be kidding...


My mom said, "I know my sweet little
Mimos will pass the Yiga test first try!"
That's why I came all the way out here...
But not only did I not pass, I didn't even
get past the front gate...

label: Talk_0005

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But...if I do join the Yiga Clan, then I'll be able to
learn some {{color id="0"}}cool moves{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If I could bust 'em out, I bet everybody'd be like,
"Wow, Mimos, you're so handsome and cool." {{delay15}}Hm?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}What, you wanna join the Yiga Clan too?


I've got some bad news—they won't let
you in unless you get your own {{color id="0"}}Yiga
outfit{{color id="-1"}} from these {{color id="0"}}three branch {{color id="-1"}}places.
Boy, what a dangerous, life-threatening
ordeal that must be! You should probably
just give up now, I'd say.
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I better try to scare him off... Keep the competition
slim. Not that I have any idea where to start.

I guess there was a rumor the Yiga Clan took over
the what's-its-name lab way up northeast in Akkala...
Maybe that's something.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Wh-whoa! A real live Yiga!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Awesome! I've never seen one in person
before! So that's the Yiga outfit, huh?
Looks even more stylish than I thought!
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}OK, that settles it! I'm finding those branches and
getting those duds! Then those cool Yiga moves will
be all mine!
Oh man, I'm gonna be SOOO popular!{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}
