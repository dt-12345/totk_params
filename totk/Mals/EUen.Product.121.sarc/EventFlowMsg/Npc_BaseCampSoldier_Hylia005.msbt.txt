{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}...Good morning.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}...Good day.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}...Good evening.{{pageBreak}}Pardon me. I was a bit absorbed in
my thoughts.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What an unusual relic. And look... {{delay15}}There's
something inside.

I believe this device is meant for some
special purpose, but as for what that
may be, who knows?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Similar devices have been found in
Kakariko Village to the east and Tarrey
Town to the northeast.
I want to unlock this gizmo's secrets
before the researchers in those other
places do. I must!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This relic is a special device. It has some
great purpose, as yet unknown to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I have to find it out before the researchers
east in Kakariko Village or northeast in
Tarrey Town beat me to the punch.
I want to be known as the one who
unraveled this mystery!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}By the bridge up ahead, there's a strange
spherical relic I have been studying. But
it's not the only one of its kind.
Similar relics have been sighted in two
other places—{{delay8}}Kakariko Village in the east
and Tarrey Town to the northeast.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Perhaps I should try studying each of
them to see if they have any common
features.

label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Researchers in Kakariko Village to the
east and Tarrey Town to the northeast
are also studying the spherical relics.
Well! I'm dead set on figuring out their
secrets before they do.

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Oh... Just a dream.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I've been researching the spherical relic
up ahead near the suspension bridges.

But other researchers are studying similar
sites in Kakariko Village to the east and
Tarrey Town to the northeast.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I want to solve the relic riddles before
they do, but there's so much work left...{{delay15}}
The urgency makes it hard to sleep.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All I can think about are those spherical
relics. They've even started to make
appearances in my dreams.
I don't want to lose out to those
researchers in Kakariko Village to the
east or Tarrey Town to the northeast.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But I'm so sleepy...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}You did it! You got it to work!{{pageBreak}}How did you—{{delay8}} Wait, don't tell me.
Let me figure it out.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So, if you put something on that dish,
it gets sucked in...

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}How in the world did you get that thing
out of there?{{pageBreak}}Actually, don't tell me. I want to work it
out for myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Apologies, but I'm headed to my post.
Can we talk later?

label: Moving_Evening

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Apologies, but I was just on my way back
to the tent. Can we pick this up later?

label: Moving_Rain

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Apologies, but I'd like to shelter from this
rain over in the tent. Can this wait?

Is it some kind of device?

label: Balloon_Evening

Are they all...similar?
