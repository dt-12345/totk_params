{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My duties today are complete.

---
label: talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My maintenance duties are complete for
today. {{delay15}}It has been another cycle with
no visitors.

---
label: talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh?

---
label: talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}This is a rarity. {{delay8}}It is unusual for me to
receive visitors here.{{pageBreak}}I assume you will require Zonai devices
to descend the mountain. Would you like
to use the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There is a slight issue. {{delay8}}You do not seem
to have an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It is impressive that you have come so far
without one. {{delay8}}Not everyone could do so.{{pageBreak}}But an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}} will be essential to
traverse the rest of this island.

---
label: talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You also cannot use the Zonai devices
from the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}} without an
{{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I recall the {{color id="0"}}Maker Construct {{color id="-1"}}by the
riverside at the base of the mountain
having a spare {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We will speak again when you come into
possession of an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It seems that you still do not have an
{{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}You cannot make use of Zonai devices
without an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}. {{color id="0"}}Device dispensers{{color id="-1"}}
will also not function for you.

---
label: talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Maker Construct {{color id="-1"}}by the riverside at
the base of the mountain should have a
spare {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let us speak again after you have
acquired an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh? {{delay8}}You seem to have finally acquired an
{{color id="0"}}Energy Cell{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}This will enable you to use Zonai devices.{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}Device dispensers{{color id="-1"}} are now also available
for your use.

---
label: talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Pardon this late explanation. {{delay8}}I prepare
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} here that are useful for
descending the mountain.{{pageBreak}}The difficulty of descending the mountain
from this high perch {{delay8}}calls for the {{color id="0"}}wing{{color id="-1"}}-
type {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}} can provide you
with one.

---
label: talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you see the bowl-like receptacle? Hold
resources in your hands and deposit them
there. The dispenser will process them.{{pageBreak}}You can insert resources such as
{{color id="0"}}construct horns{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Zonai charges{{color id="-1"}} to
receive Zonai devices in return.

---
label: talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My maintenance is fully complete. You are
free to use the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser {{color id="-1"}}anytime.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}This is a rarity. {{delay8}}It is unusual for me to

Device dispenser?

---
label: 0003
---
I'm fine.

---
label: talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes. I am manufacturing {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}
using this {{color id="0"}}device dispenser{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you see the bowl-like receptacle?
Resources held in your hands can be
deposited there.{{pageBreak}}It accepts resources such as {{color id="0"}}construct
horns {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}Zonai charges {{color id="-1"}}for processing.

label: talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The altitude here is incredibly high. It is
no easy task to descend the mountain.{{pageBreak}}That is why I am preparing {{color id="0"}}wing{{color id="-1"}}-type{{color id="0"}}
Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}. They are useful tools for
making your descent.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}} are very convenient.
They are a portable form of {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}
that you can retrieve at any time.{{pageBreak}}I suggest that you deposit resources in
the device dispenser before proceeding.

---
label: talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It is interesting to have a visitor after so
long in isolation. {{delay8}}I am happy to address
whatever questions you have.

---
label: talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see you are still here. {{delay8}}I am ordinarily
alone on this mountain. The conversation
we are having is very exciting to me.

---
label: talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh. {{delay8}}I remember you.

---
label: talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you require the {{color id="0"}}device dispenser {{color id="-1"}}or
any {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0011
---
The device dispenser.

---
label: talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Device dispensers{{color id="-1"}} make it possible to
produce portable Zonai devices in the
form of {{color id="0"}}Zonai capsules{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}They are simple to use.{{delay8}} Hold materials in
your hands. Then place them into the
receptacle. It is similar to a cooking pot.{{pageBreak}}Accepted resources are things such as
{{color id="0"}}construct horns {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}Zonai charges{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The altitude here is incredibly high. The
{{color id="0"}}wing-type Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} are useful tools
for making your descent.{{pageBreak}}I suggest that you deposit resources in
the device dispenser before proceeding.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}It is cold here. You can light a fire nearby
to warm yourself if you plan to remain
for long.

---
label: talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh. {{delay8}}You have returned.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My duties are complete. {{delay8}}But I have not
had visitors in some time. I would
welcome some conversation.
