{{anim type="Notice_01"}}So Hyrule Castle rose up into the sky,
Zelda vanished right in front of you...

and now you've come here looking
for clues.

---
label: Talk_11

{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Link, I understand how you're feeling.


Zelda is a dear friend to me as well. I will
do everything in my power to help you.

---
label: Talk_01
---
But to do that, I need to bring a quick
resolution to a problem we Gerudo
are facing...

---
label: Talk_02
---
I'm sure you've noticed that the desert
is even more difficult to cross than usual.

---
label: Talk_03
---
That's thanks to this unusual sand
shroud. It appeared around the same time
the events at Hyrule Castle took place.
{{anim type="Angry_00"}}It has blanketed the whole desert,
including our town.

---
label: Talk_04
---
And not long after that, swarms of
monsters we'd never seen before began
attacking. We're calling them {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_05
---
Physical attacks don't work well against
them. They are slow,{{delay8}} but they still make
investigating the sand shroud difficult.

Were you watching just now?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I've been practicing striking that dummy
over there with lightning...

If I can aim the lightning well, I think it
may be an effective weapon against
the Gibdos.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{anim type="Angry_00"}}But this technique is...unrefined. I only
recently discovered it and still need
more practice.

---
label: Talk_09
---
I want to master this power so I can use it
to defeat the Gibdos.

If I can do that, we can investigate the
source of this sand shroud and search for
Zelda, as well!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Link! Will you help me with my training?

---
label: Talk_10

I think I can use your arrows to help me
aim my lightning strikes. Fire one at that
{{color id="0"}}dummy{{color id="-1"}} over there!
