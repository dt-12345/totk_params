{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh. Just a two-legs. {{delay15}}Are you a fellow

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}There's nowhere better to watch whole
herds of wild horses go by.{{pageBreak}}Is there something wrong with that? {{delay8}}I love
horses, so I come here to see them in the
wild. It's that simple.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But you know...{{delay8}}there is something else
here almost as interesting as a horse.{{pageBreak}}You know that one crumbled part of the
mountain where the ruins fell, next to the
{{color id="0"}}stone shrine{{color id="-1"}} a little ways down this hill?{{pageBreak}}I found this {{color id="0"}}mysterious crystal {{color id="-1"}}that
must've fallen as well. And as soon as I
saw it, I had a genius idea.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Look at the way this crystal glitters. Don't
you think that would look handsome on
a horse?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I could prop it up in the saddle {{delay8}}or attach
it to the harness...{{delay15}}whatever makes the
horse look most incredible.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Look at the way this crystal glitters. Don't

What kind of setup would make the horse
look MOST incredible?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If you're wondering, I still haven't made

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Makes sense. As a fellow horse-lover,
you'd also want to deck out your favorite
steed with one. {{delay8}}I get it.
But just because I get it {{delay8}}doesn't mean
I'm going to hand it over, no questions
asked.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Though...maybe you can help me out.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I've been hearing talk about an {{color id="0"}}enormous
horse{{color id="-1"}} spotted in this region.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I'd love the chance to see this {{color id="0"}}giant horse{{color id="-1"}}
for myself, {{delay8}}but I haven't had any luck
so far.{{pageBreak}}But here you are. {{delay8}}From one horse-lover
to another, I have a proposal.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}If you can bring me that {{color id="0"}}gigantic horse{{color id="-1"}},
the crystal is all yours.{{pageBreak}}And I'm not going to leave you to search
without a single hint either. You should
ask around at the nearby {{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}A ways down the road east from here is
{{color id="0"}}Highland Stable{{color id="-1"}}. You could try there.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Lots of people gather at stables. They're
good places to get tips straight from the
horse's mouth.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sure, see you later. {{delay8}}And if you get any
good ideas about how to accessorize a
horse with a giant crystal, I'm listening.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! That's quite a friend you have there.{{delay8}}
I don't need to look at you to see how
you care for it. {{delay8}}Its eyes tell the story.

---
label: Talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}No offense, but horses are better than
anything, including you and me.{{pageBreak}}I only got out of bed today to watch the
horses as they prance a little farther
along this ridge.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Whoa! {{delay8}}Now that's a scary-looking mount.{{delay15}}
But what's this? {{delay8}}It's a monster and a
horse too?{{pageBreak}}It's got good bones, but not much else.
{{delay8}}Still, kudos for taming such an ominous
beast of a horse.

What if I gave you this nice, shiny crystal?{{pageBreak}}I picked it up as I was passing through.{{pageBreak}}I was thinking about using it to deck out
my horse to make it the best-looking
beast the world's ever seen.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}But when I saw that giant stallion you
showed me, I realized I'd been a fool.{{pageBreak}}There's no improving on a horse—any
