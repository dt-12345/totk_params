{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Sorry...{{pageBreak}}I don't think you and I will have a
lot in common if you're wearing so
little clothing.
So, if you'll excuse me...

---
label: ComMainCloth_W_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there!{{delay8}} I hope your travels are
treating you well.

So, I take it, if you've struck up a
conversation with a fashion-forward
type like me, all the way out here...
you must also be searching for pieces
of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0004
---
Treasure?

---
label: 0005
---
What's that?

---
label: ComMainCloth_W_002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh!{{delay8}} You don't know?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There was once a {{color id="0"}}legendary bandit{{color id="-1"}} by
the name of {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}. But thievery isn't
what made them a legend...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It was their unparalleled fashion sense!


It's said that Misko collected rare outfits
from all over the world and hid their
pieces throughout Hyrule.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It may only be a story, but who could
resist the call of garments like that?

For fashion lovers like me, {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}} is the ultimate score. That's why
we're out in force trying to find it!

---
label: ComMainCloth_W_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So!{{delay8}} Fate and fashion must have brought
the two of us together, right here!

Shall I tell you where pieces of {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}} are said to be hidden?

---
label: 0006
---
Tell me!

---
label: 0007
---
I'm OK for now.

---
label: Talk01
---
{{anim type="LaughS"}}I thought that might strike your
fashionable fancy!{{delay15}} Now...{{delay8}}do you have
a {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Oh?{{delay15}} No interest in treasure hunting,
then?{{delay15}} Well, everyone's free to travel
as they please, I suppose.
On that note, I should probably get back
to my own journey. It's been a pleasure
chatting with you.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I plan to visit every region, so be sure to
say hello if you catch sight of me again!{{pageBreak}}Farewell for now!

---
label: Talk02_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Oh...{{delay15}} So you're still not interested?{{delay15}} Well,
to each their own when it comes to travel.

{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}And I prefer the added flavor of the
treasure hunt!{{delay15}} I'm going to get back to it,
but do come chat if you see me again!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}If it isn't the fashionable traveler!{{delay15}}
How have you been?{{pageBreak}}Personally, I'm still on the lookout for
pieces of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk03_01
---
{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Fate must have conspired to bring us
back together.{{pageBreak}}I know you weren't interested in {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}} the other day, but should I tell
you where it's hidden now?

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What?{{delay15}} Did I hear that right?{{delay15}} You found
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}?!{{pageBreak}}And you found all three places I was going
to tell you about all by yourself?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That's incredible!{{delay15}} You were playing it cool,
but you were a master treasure hunter
all along!
I had so many rumors to share with you,
but...{{delay15}} Ha! {{delay8}}Clearly you didn't need them.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Hehe.{{delay15}} Well, look who came right back!
{{delay15}}I knew you wouldn't be able to resist
those legendary clothes.{{pageBreak}}So, shall I tell you where {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}
is rumored to be hidden after all?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}All of this information comes from my
other fashion-forward friends, who travel

I'm not sure if any of these looks will fit
with my personal sense of style, but you
never know...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}All of these details come from my various
fashion-forward friends, who travel in
other regions.
But I'm not sure any of these treasures
are quite right for me, given I don't like
to battle, and I don't climb cliffs.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If you're attempting a difficult journey, I'm
sure such styles could come in handy!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, sorry.{{delay8}} I've gone on and on. It's been
a while since I've been able to talk fashion

Misko's legendary outfits. Good luck!{{delay8}}
