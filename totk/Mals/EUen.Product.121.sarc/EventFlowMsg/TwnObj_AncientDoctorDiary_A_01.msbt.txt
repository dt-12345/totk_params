If you scan the surrounding terrain using
a {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}, you can register the
{{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}to your Purah Pad.
Additionally, you can travel instantly to
the location of a {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}that
you've already registered by selecting it.
This handy-instant-travel-to-a-registered-
location feature has been dubbed "{{color id="0"}}travel{{color id="-1"}}"
by its clever inventor, Purah.
