{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}The sundelion is a {{color id="0"}}new species of plant{{color id="-1"}}.

I believe that means they grow on the

some sort of relationship with the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If I can prove that, I think they might help
