{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there. How go your travels?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Have you heard about the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}},
friend to fashionistas everywhere?{{pageBreak}}They say a {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}blesses clothing
with enchantments {{color id="-1"}}that can take the sting
out of monster attacks.{{pageBreak}}If you want to see for yourself, one of
them lives on top of that hill to the side
of {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

label: StartPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I have one burning question about the
{{color id="0"}}blessing from the Great Fairy {{color id="-1"}}on top of
that hill to the side of {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}.
Can she work her magic on Cece's
clothes too?

---
label: StartPoint_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Right now the Great Fairy is locked up
in her flower bud and won't come out.{{delay8}}
Frustrating, isn't it?{{pageBreak}}One more thing to blame on the Upheaval.

---
label: StartPoint_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The road to the Great Fairy crumbled
in the Upheaval, so my horse can't make
it up there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But that's OK. Having a horse is blessing
enough without needing the Great Fairy's
clothes blessings on top.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Have you heard the stories of {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}, the
bandit from long ago?{{pageBreak}}One of the tales passed down has them
hiding some{{color id="0"}} legendary clothing{{color id="-1"}} in a {{color id="0"}}cave
at Tamio River{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}I don't understand why this bandit Misko
would hide their {{color id="0"}}clothing {{color id="-1"}}in a damp {{color id="0"}}cave
at Tamio River{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}If I had just one sock from that collection,
I'd flaunt it! I'd wear it every single day!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I think the cave is in this direction.{{pageBreak}}This looks to turn into an animal trail
down the road, so it might be hard to
get through there on horseback.{{pageBreak}}I don't want anything to happen to my
horse, so I might give up on this approach
and try another way.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there, traveler.{{delay15}} Would you like to
take shelter from the rain with me?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}These Cece clothes aren't waterproof, so
the rain is a constant thorn in my side.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I love these clothes, so I want to treat
them gently. But I also want to wear them
every day. It's a conundrum.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know, the bandit Misko solved this
issue by hiding their personal {{color id="0"}}collection
of clothes in caves{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Supposedly, the cave at {{color id="0"}}Tamio River to
the northwest {{color id="-1"}}is one such stash.{{pageBreak}}But how did they resist the urge to wear
their finest out and about? I'm still
mulling that one over.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Have you already met the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}
near {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}There's a rumor among us fashionistas
that a Great Fairy's blessing can {{color id="0"}}make
your clothes tougher{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Looking fabulous AND feeling fearless?
It sounds too good to be true! {{delay15}}If only I
could meet her and ask...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I get attacked by monsters on the road,
so I'd like to get a blessing from the
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} near {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Tougher clothes {{color id="-1"}}would make my journey
easier, but there are...obstacles to that.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's an old legend among us
fashionistas—the story of {{color id="0"}}Misko {{color id="-1"}}the
bandit and their {{color id="0"}}legendary clothes{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It's said that they hid some in a {{color id="0"}}cave near
Tamio River{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}That's a little far away, but I'm tempted to
make the trip and look for it.{{pageBreak}}I just don't want to get my clothes dirty...

label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't stop thinking about the {{color id="0"}}legendary
clothes{{color id="-1"}} hidden by the bandit Misko!{{pageBreak}}I had to come when I heard that some are
hidden at the {{color id="0"}}cave at Tamio River{{color id="-1"}}, which
flows {{color id="0"}}northwest {{color id="-1"}}of here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's a little far, but I thought it might be

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Every traveler has to contend with
monster attacks now and again.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}But I hear that visiting the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}
might really help with that.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The word is that the Great Fairy can use
her power to make {{color id="0"}}clothes tough as any
set of armor{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}People say there's a {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} up the

I wonder if she'd help me.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'm no traveling swordsman, but I have

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}This is more myth than gossip, I suppose.{{delay15}}
But have you heard of {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} the bandit
and their {{color id="0"}}legendary clothing{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Their collection of clothes is supposed to
be hidden in caves all over the world.{{pageBreak}}One of those, if the tales are true, is in
the {{color id="0"}}cave at Tamio River{{color id="-1"}}, which flows
northwest of here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Isn't that a charming story? I want to

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Why would the bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko {{color id="-1"}}hide their
