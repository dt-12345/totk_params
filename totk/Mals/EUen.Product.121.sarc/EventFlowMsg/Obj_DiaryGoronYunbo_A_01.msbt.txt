After the eruption at Death Mountain
stopped, the lava stopped flowing all
over Eldin.
Then it got colder. The sudden shift in
climate has made folks feel sick.

And whoever isn't sick is upset by how
different everything is round here.

At this rate, Goron City will fall apart.
I keep wondering if there's anything I
can do.

The lava has cooled and hardened, which
means we can reach areas we weren't
able to before.
Eldin is covered in rock now, and there's
ore galore! There's only one thing to
do now.
Dig and dig until there's no more digging
to be done. We'll dig up every bit of ore
and get the city back to booming!

I was busy digging in the caves and
mining ore, and before I knew it,
everyone was helping out.
Slergo and Offrak were the most
ambitious of the group.

I thought I was the only one who cared
enough to get the city back to booming,
but I was wrong!
I figured it's a good time to offer job
security to everyone by starting up
a company.
We're calling it YunoboCo. Slergo and
Offrak came up with the name.

It's still pretty chilly around here these
days, but most of us have gotten used
to it.
With the temperatures cooler, now
anyone can visit Goron City without
using fire-proof gear!
We're going to build a new road so to
make it more welcoming to travelers.

With more travelers passing through, we
can offer the ore mined up by YunoboCo
for a special price!

Something called the Upheaval happened,
and Hyrule Castle is floating in the air!

Princess Zelda and Link have gone
missing, and Purah has sent out search
parties. I'd like to go lend a hand...
But lately there has been strange red
haze coming from Death Mountain.

Before I leave, I'll go see what's going
on to make sure everyone in the city and
my workers at YunoboCo are safe.
