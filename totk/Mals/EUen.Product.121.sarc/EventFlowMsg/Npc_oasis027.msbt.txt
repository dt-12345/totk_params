{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Every inscription on the stelae starts with,
"the seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo." After that, it goes...
"Their secret will be expressed on
six monuments.{{pageBreak}}"An eighth channels and guides the
powers of these seven.{{pageBreak}}"The powers of the seven are heart,
skill, fortitude, wisdom, flight, mobility,

the Gerudo.{{pageBreak}}"When their powers return to them,
the shrouded eighth will be known."
That's all six of the inscriptions.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So to sum it all up...{{pageBreak}}The eighth directs the powers of the
seven—{{delay8}}heart, skill, fortitude, wisdom,

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}"The seven heroines who protect the
Gerudo. Their secret will be expressed
on six stelae.{{pageBreak}}"The seven heroines who protect the

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Once we returned the spirits to all seven
heroines,{{delay8}} the ground shook, and a hidden
room appeared.{{pageBreak}}"Our hearts are full with gratitude and
praise for the one who saw in us all that
we could be.{{pageBreak}}"We have enshrined an appropriate gift in
the sanctuary at North Gerudo Ruins.{{pageBreak}}"The outsized orb near the eighth statue
shall be the key that opens the way."{{pageBreak}}Tucked away in that room was a key that
would guide us to a long-hidden truth.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Nice, eh? {{delay8}}That's how the second volume
kicks off!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What I found deep within the place we call
our sanctuary was a treasure meant for
the eighth hero, along with a final stela.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This part's a bit long, but bear with me,
and I'll zip right through it, OK?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"Long ago, a monstrosity of the sands
attacked Gerudo Town. Its war cry rang
out over the dunes like a raging demon.{{pageBreak}}"We seven heroines of the Gerudo—the
most stalwart, chosen vai—surged forth
to engage it.{{pageBreak}}"Yet this monstrosity tossed us about like
the tumbling weeds. We feared that the
proud Gerudo would be extinguished.{{pageBreak}}"And then...a hero appeared from afar.
He marshaled the seven heroines,
counseling us to combine our strengths.{{pageBreak}}"With strength upon strength, we seven
routed the monstrosity. We named our
benefactor, 'the guiding light of Gerudo.'{{pageBreak}}"Yet though we had naught but the
highest praise for him, he was refused
entry into Gerudo Town.{{pageBreak}}"'Twas Gerudo law that all those like him
were barred.{{pageBreak}}"How hollow our gratitude and praise
must have rung in this hero's ears!{{pageBreak}}"Thus was the link between his people
and the Gerudo severed.{{pageBreak}}"Though we never bequeathed it to him,
the gift into which our feelings are bound
is enshrined at this sanctuary."{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Phew, that's all of it. I didn't get any of
that wrong, did I?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Anyway, that's the big moment of the
third volume.
