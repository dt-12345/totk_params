We have learned much about the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.
Familiarize yourself with this information!

1. Nothing can disperse {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}. Not even
electricity, fire, or cold.

2. Touching {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} sucks away life force.
Watch where you step, and {{color id="0"}}avoid contact{{color id="-1"}}.

3. If you DO make contact, {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}
provide effective treatment. Alternatively,
{{color id="0"}}return to the surface{{color id="-1"}}.
In addition, promising new research
shows {{color id="0"}}the light of roots growing from
the ceiling{{color id="-1"}} may help recovery.
However, since the roots' light is so weak,
additional research is needed to see if
these effects can be increased.

Everything we do must be in service to

mine {{color id="0"}}crystallized charges{{color id="-1"}}.
The {{color id="0"}}crystals {{color id="-1"}}seem to contain a mysterious

They are readily found in the {{color id="0"}}abandoned

Everyone has been ordered to carry a
medicinal herb called a {{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}} at all
times while in the Depths.
This order is based on intelligence stolen
from the Zonai Survey Team.

"{{color id="0"}}Sundelions{{color id="-1"}} have shown promise as a
treatment for those suffering decreased
vitality due to {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} exposure.
"This rare herb is found only in {{color id="0"}}areas

Base Construction Manual, Vol. 1


{{color id="0"}}Relay bases{{color id="-1"}} must be built to facilitate safe
and effective navigation of the Depths.

When choosing a site for a base, consider
locations where the {{color id="0"}}terrain can be used to
defend against monsters{{color id="-1"}}.
1. Choose a {{color id="0"}}high location{{color id="-1"}} that monsters
can't reach. Construction may be difficult,
but the protection will be worth the effort.
2. Create a sandbank surrounded by
{{color id="0"}}water{{color id="-1"}}. Most monsters can't swim.

3. When building on flat terrain is
unavoidable, sufficiently fortify defenses
with barricades.

Relics named {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices {{color id="-1"}}are regularly

It will remain a mystery. All we know is
that each device has its own power

It would be folly not to harness this power
for our own designs. We must find a way

The only known way to enter the Depths

But take heart—the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} that leaks from
these pits acts as a beacon, and most can
be seen from above.
Glory to Master Kohga.

This area may have an assortment of
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}, but their rarity on the
surface makes them unusually valuable.
One surface location is an exception—
many devices have fallen from the sky in
the area around {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}.
This location may have rare devices that
we have not yet seen. Tell the surface
team to maintain vigilant surveillance.
And while they're at it, see if they can
figure out what makes this site unique.

Glory to Master Kohga.

On a previous intel assignment in
Gerudo Town, I overheard an old legend,
passed down for generations.
It begins, "{{color id="0"}}Under the site of the arbiter{{color id="-1"}},
in the darkness of the subterranean
depths, {{color id="0"}}lies a great treasure{{color id="-1"}}."
Obviously, when that kind of legend fails
to yield any treasure for years, it tends to
fade from public consciousness.
So now that searchers are few and the
"{{color id="0"}}subterranean depths{{color id="-1"}}" beneath the
Gerudo Desert are open to us...
it would seem the perfect time for me
to swoop in and secure that treasure...
If not for the second part of the legend.
"Whosoever seeks this treasure must
overcome their fear, as they will be met
by a vortex of the {{color id="0"}}wrath of the executed{{color id="-1"}}."
I know that I must take this opportunity,
but I just can't muster the courage.
Master Kohga, grant me your bravery.
Glory to Master Kohga.

A {{color id="0"}}secret hot spring{{color id="-1"}} was recently located
in a valley in the Hebra Mountains. I found
that curious, given that most are in Eldin.
However, upon being dispatched to this
area, I discovered the spring's source—a
{{color id="0"}}waterfall of flowing lava{{color id="-1"}} in the Depths.
Put plainly, this is confirmation of a
{{color id="0"}}connection{{color id="-1"}} between the Depths and
the surface.
Where else might these connections be?
Maybe there's more to discover in this
place than I initially thought.
Glory to Master Kohga.
