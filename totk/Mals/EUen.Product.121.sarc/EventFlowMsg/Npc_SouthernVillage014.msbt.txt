{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So you're Link, huh? Some of the soldiers
were just telling me.

As a simple man from {{color id="0"}}Lurelin{{color id="-1"}}, I'm a

celebrities back home!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Need to buy anything?


You should talk to my wife! She's the
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin {{color id="-1"}}cutie who runs the shop upstairs.

Lurelin?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Lurelin Village! It's a fishing town in
{{color id="0"}}East Necluda{{color id="-1"}}, faaar to the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}.

Used to be a popular resort, thanks to its
sandy white beaches and gorgeous views
of the sparkling sea.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Then we got attacked by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}. Now,
no one's living there, let alone running
the shops...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But listen to me getting all gloomy!
There is an upside. If not for the pirates,
my wife and I wouldn't have come here.
I should just shut my trap and enjoy the
charms of {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}!

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I really am grateful they took us in and let

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}There was no one in my village quite

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Beds! You believe that? In my village,
you couldn't find these anywhere but
at the {{color id="0"}}inn{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}How about that hidden passageway?
Neat, huh? I'll have to look for one of
those in my village, if I ever get back.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I might ask the {{color id="0"}}monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}}
if they can deal with the pirates in
my village.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Say, did you see those books they have
here? I tried reading one the other day.

Complete gibberish. How can the {{color id="0"}}Zonai
Survey Team {{color id="-1"}}make sense of that stuff?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I feel like such a fish out of water here.
There's a whole lot of world outside my
little village!

---
label: Talk_25
---
Well, I'm glad to hear everyone in the
village is safe.

Now if we could just run those pirates out
of town...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Mark my words—one day, we will, and the
village will go back to how it was.

And when that day comes, I'll reopen {{color id="0"}}the
Lurelin Village store{{color id="-1"}}!

You'll stop by, of course.

{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} is safe? That's great!{{pageBreak}}I'm looking forward to the day everything
there is rebuilt so we can all return home.
