The poor Great Fairy...

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Ah!{{delay8}} We meet again!{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Did you come to see the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0005
---
Great Fairy?

---
label: 0006
---
No.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Yes, indeed! {{delay8}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy Mija{{color id="-1"}} settled
close to Snowfield Stable.

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}No? What kind of answer is that?{{delay15}} But...
Wait a moment!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It must be fate that we met again. And
fate must want you to hear what I have
to say!{{delay8}}
You see, a {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy {{color id="-1"}}has settled close to
Snowfield Stable.

---
label: Talk_0010_00_01
---
{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Can you see it through the snow?

---
label: Talk_0010_00_02
---
{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Can you still see it this late at night?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Alas, {{delay8}}the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is hiding inside her
flower bud.

She's too frightened to come out, just like
her sister at Woodland Stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This Great Fairy always liked the timbre of
{{color id="0"}}Eustus's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}}, so I thought to calm her
nerves with his soothing tootles.

---
label: Talk_0010_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'd like to depart for the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}'s bud
straightway. Only one small hitch...

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Our Breezer's roof is broken, so we'd be
at the mercy of the elements. Imagine if
we were caught in the snow!
Why, we might fall ill, and how could we
perform at our best then?

label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Our Breezer's roof is broken, so we'd be
at the mercy of the elements. Just look at
all the snow falling!
We might fall ill in such weather, and how
could we perform at our best then?

---
label: Talk_0012_01
---
I did try to attach a{{color id="0"}} roof{{color id="-1"}} to Breezer.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Alas, I couldn't reach high enough to do
more than set up some posts.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If we can't put a roof on Breezer, {{delay8}}our
performance for the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy {{color id="-1"}}is as
good as canceled!

---
label: Talk_0006_01
---
{{color id="0"}}Eustus{{color id="-1"}} is a young man who plays the horn
for us Stable Trotters.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}But one day, he split off from the troupe,
and no one's seen him since.

---
label: Talk_0006_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}There was one traveler who came from
{{color id="0"}}Tabantha Bridge Stable{{color id="-1"}} far south of here
who heard a sound like a {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}}.
It came from a place well past the other
end of the {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}},
somewhere along that road.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But that's so far away! {{delay15}}Oh, Eustus, where
could you have gone?

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm curious...{{delay15}}did you stop by to visit the
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} in these parts?

---
label: Near_0004

What became of Eustus?

---
label: Near_0006
---
Stay safe, Eustus...

---
label: Talk_0601
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Alas, the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} here has closed
herself off to the world and remains
inside her flower bud.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This Great Fairy always liked the timbre of
{{color id="0"}}Eustus's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}}, so I thought to calm her
nerves with his soothing tootles.

---
label: Talk_0601_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}But for that, we'd need {{color id="0"}}Eustus{{color id="-1"}}, and you'll
notice he isn't here.

---
label: Talk_0602
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Eustus {{color id="-1"}}is really the key element here,
and he's nowhere to be found.

---
label: Talk_0621
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Do you need something?

---
label: Talk_0622
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What's this?! {{delay8}}You found Eustus?! {{delay15}}He's
down in a hole somewhere around
Tabantha Great Bridge?!{{pageBreak}}Good heavens. {{delay8}}What a sorry predicament!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I wish I could help him, but I couldn't claw
my way out of a puddle. {{delay8}}No, I'd only make
things worse for the boy.{{pageBreak}}All I can do is stay put and pray that
Eustus returns to us in one piece.

---
label: Talk_0623
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}All I can do is wait and hope that {{color id="0"}}Eustus{{color id="-1"}}
makes his way out of that hole that's
somewhere near Tabantha Great Bridge.

---
label: Talk_0700
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Now that Eustus is here, we can bring the
sound of his horn to the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}It would be wonderful if we could go and
perform for her right away.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}But of course, there's always something
holding up the show!

---
label: Near_0005
---
Our Eustus is back!

---
label: Near_0002
---
Ugh. What will we do?

---
label: Talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}We simply must put on a performance for
the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}. Our music will be just the
thing to encourage her out of her bud.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But with the roof of our Breezer in
disrepair, we can't reach her.

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wish we could outfit our Breezer with a
{{color id="0"}}roof{{color id="-1"}} somehow in order to make the trip
to the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'm eager to perform for the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}
and show her the world isn't all bad.

I'll take you.

---

Where is she?

---

I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_0202_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} has shut herself inside
a flower bud on that mountain.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}This Great Fairy appreciates the unique
tones of {{color id="0"}}Eustus's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}horn{{color id="-1"}}, so I thought we'd
coax her out with his soothing tootles.

---
label: Talk_0202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Did I hear you say you'll take us to where
the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} awaits?!

---
label: Talk_0207
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}But for that, we'd have to—{{delay8}} What's this?!{{delay8}}
Our Breezer has been fitted with a {{color id="0"}}roof{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}♪The world hasn't abandoned us!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Wonderful! {{delay8}}Now that our Breezer has a

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Although... {{delay8}}That roof as it is now makes
me uneasy. {{delay15}}Would it be possible to
{{color id="0"}}expand it a bit{{color id="-1"}}?

label: Talk_0206_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If only our Breezer had a proper {{color id="0"}}roof{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
But if wishes were fishes, eh?

---
label: Talk_0209

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}We're all aboard!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}The road to the Great Fairy starts by
{{color id="0"}}going around from the left{{color id="-1"}} and climbing
a little ways up the mountain.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I leave the rest to you, good sir!

---
label: Talk_0203

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Ah. I appreciate the sentiment, but our
Breezer needs {{color id="0"}}a roof to keep off the snow{{color id="-1"}}
before we can get to the Great Fairy.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Eh? {{delay15}}Where's our Breezer?! {{delay15}}How are we
