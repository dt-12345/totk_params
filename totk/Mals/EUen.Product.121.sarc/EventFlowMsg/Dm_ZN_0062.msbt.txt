Goodness, I'm beat.

Of course it's raining.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, so you're here. Came to learn about
the Zonai from an expert, I gather?

---
label: Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I should welcome you to our humble base
of operations. Behold! This is where the
real investigation starts.

---
label: Talk_011

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}It might not seem like much next to that
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}, I'll concede.

label: Talk_002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Going forward, our research will proceed
from here. {{delay8}}Tauro has already gone off to
the Zonai Ruins.{{pageBreak}}If memory serves, he spoke of starting his
investigation around {{color id="0"}}Dracozu Lake{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Go {{color id="0"}}southeast {{color id="-1"}}and you should find the
Zonai Ruins he volunteered to inspect.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm curious if the "dragon land" written of
at the Ring Ruin will have any more leads
on the Demon King or Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}Ordinarily, I'd be right there at his side in
the field, of course.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I'm worn out from setting up the base.
I'll need some time to recuperate before
I begin my own survey.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}Goodness me, is there anything at all that slows
down Tauro?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That said...it's night now and he hasn't
returned, which is worrying. Did he get
swept up in his work at the site?{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}My goodness, the man is absolutely indefatigable.{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_012

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm very curious to know more about that
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay15}}Hm?

---
label: Talk_013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh. {{delay8}}It's you again. Did you manage to
meet up with {{color id="0"}}Tauro{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh? {{delay8}}Not deterred by the rain, eh? Were
you able to meet up with {{color id="0"}}Tauro{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh? {{delay8}}Not deterred by the dark at this hour,
eh? Did you ever meet up with {{color id="0"}}Tauro{{color id="-1"}}?

label: Talk_016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Did you still need something?{{pageBreak}}There's nothing I can tell you about the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}, and I don't know {{color id="0"}}Tauro{{color id="-1"}}'s
whereabouts either.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Er...{{delay15}}did you still need something from
me? I do have work here, you know.

label: Talk_018
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And it doesn't help that I can't take my eyes off that
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}. It's almost too impressive.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah. {{delay15}}Still here, eh? Did you need anything
else from me?

I haven't seen him.

I met up with him.

Where's Tauro?

---

I saw him already.

Skyview Tower?

---

Goodbye.

I met with Tauro.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What, you're still looking for him? But
don't you know?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Eh? You've already met with Tauro?
And the two of you have begun to make
progress at the ruins?!{{pageBreak}}*sigh* At least there's still the "dragon
land" mentioned at the Ring Ruin to
survey. I wish I could get a head start.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Perhaps once I've rested just a bit more.
I'll need to be at my best—I must bring

To be candid, I don't know its purpose.
But it makes an excellent landmark for
finding our base again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{size value="80"}}Though I wish it weren't so humbling to look at.
The base I set up seems so meager in comparison.{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_025

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I refer to the tall tower next to us.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What's that? {{delay8}}This Skyview Tower doesn't
even work, you say?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}I don't know what you expect me to do
about it. {{delay8}}Take it up with whoever built
the thing.{{pageBreak}}Setting up this base was hard enough on
me without passersby expecting me to
play repairman.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}I worked hard to build it, and yet next to the
Skyview Tower, it seems so...{{delay8}}inadequate.{{pageBreak}}Ugh, all this fretting is making me thirsty.{{delay8}} Maybe I'll
get some water from that well.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay15}}Maybe I shouldn't have set up our
base so close to it to begin with.

---
label: Talk_023

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Very well. Take care.

label: Talk_009

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Not now! Can't you see it's raining?
This is no time for a leisurely chat!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Excuse me, but you're standing in the
