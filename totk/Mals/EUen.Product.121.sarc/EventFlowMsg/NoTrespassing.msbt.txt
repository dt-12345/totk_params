{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Heeey! No going past here!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Oh, you're a Hylian. Well, since you're not
a Korok, I guess I don't need to stop you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}There's this thing beyond here that I can't
stop thinking about... I keep wanting to go
check it out again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know{{delay8}} the thing that showed up in
Korok Forest?{{delay8}} I saw something similar
to that, but it looked kinda different...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But...{{delay15}}when I tried to go back to it,
there were a bunch of monsters
coming out of the woodwork.
Tree monsters and bone monsters. So
I'm keeping guard here to warn other
Koroks, because it's real dangerous.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I'm not about to stop any Hylians who
are feeling brave. {{delay8}}Just be careful.

Oh, and the flowers are there to help
keep you from getting lost. So don't go
picking them!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's lots of monsters past here, so be
careful if you continue on.
