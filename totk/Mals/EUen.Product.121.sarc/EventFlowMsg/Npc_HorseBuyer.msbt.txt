{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good morning, fellow wanderer!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, fellow wanderer!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good evening, fellow wanderer!

---
label: Greeting_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, fellow wanderer!{{delay15}} It's difficult
getting around in these parts, isn't it?

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}When I hear about a new stable, well,
hey, I have to check it out! {{delay8}}It's what a
merchant's gotta do.
New stables mean new customers. Yeah.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}A new stable means there's a big
opportunity for market expansion.
New customers, here I come!

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd love to check out Rito Village, but do
you know how cold it gets up there?
Yeah, no, thanks.
Snowfield Stable is about all the cold
I can handle. And that's WITH all the
food and stuff that warms you up.
Hey... If you're tromping around in the
snow, make sure you stock up on the
goods to keep warm.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey, you should take the cold seriously.
Make sure you've got ingredients for food
that'll keep you warm.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}I'll be OK in the rain. I've got this hat to
keep me dry!

But what about you? {{delay15}}Maybe you should
look into getting a new hat.

Anyway, I digress. Let's try to wrap this
up before you get soaked through.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hey, you're soaked! Must be freezing.
Just looking at you is giving me shivers.

Let's try to wrap this up before your
paying hand goes numb, yeah?

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This area's pretty exposed. Where am I
supposed to hide from monsters trying
to steal my goods? 
I don't want to lose my stuff,{{delay8}} but I don't
want to lose a customer either. 

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hey... Wouldn't it be easy for a monster
to spot us around here?

But business is business.{{delay8}} Let's just keep
it quick, yeah?

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Brrr. It only gets colder up ahead, so I'm
going to warm up inside {{color id="0"}}Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

Want to take a look at my goods first?
You'd better be prepared for that cold.
Safety first.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're heading that way, it'll just
get colder.{{pageBreak}}You should figure out a way to stay warm
if you're going to make it to the stable.

---
label: GoRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Up until recently, this whole area was
being pelted by snow.

Now the blizzard's over, and I can sell my
products to all the nice folks here.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}It's not...not chilly though.{{delay15}} You'll still
want to prepare for cold temperatures.

---
label: GoRange_03_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that the blizzard's over, I can sell my
products to all the nice folks here.

...It's still frigid though.{{delay15}} Make sure you're
prepared for the cold weather!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This is a shortcut to {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}},
but there are monsters everywhere.{{delay15}}

I should take it anyway, right?
For business? For...for business...

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This is the quickest path to {{color id="0"}}New Serenne
Stable{{color id="-1"}}. You just gotta be OK with
monsters everywhere.
And, honestly, I'm not OK with that at all.
But what if I meet a customer? Then it'll
be worth it, yeah?

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was thinking of exploring the deep,
long canyon that separates Hebra region
from the plains to the east.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But what if I went in and couldn't make
my way back out?{{delay8}} It'd be a hard trip even
if I wasn't weighed down with goods.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, I'm good being right here with you,
my customer!

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I bet there aren't a lot of customers
that head down into that canyon between
Hebra and the eastern plains.{{delay8}}
So, glad to stick to my usual route!

---
label: BackRange_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Although the blizzard's lifted, it'd be risky
for me to travel all the way to Rito Village.

What if my wagon wheels got stuck in
the snow? I don't even want to think
about it...
And they say your legs can sink into the
stuff just as easily. {{delay15}}So be careful, OK?

---
label: BackRange_03_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Hebra blizzard may be over, but the
area around Rito Village is still blanketed
in snow.
So be careful, OK? {{delay15}}You don't want your
legs sinking into the stuff.
