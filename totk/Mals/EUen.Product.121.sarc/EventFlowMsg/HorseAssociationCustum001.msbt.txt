{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh!{{delay15}} Did you hear me singing?
How embarrassing...

label: Talk21

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That jingle's been stuck in my head ever
since I heard that Hudson Construction
started making {{color id="0"}}dream homes{{color id="-1"}}.
Someday I hope I can make the trip east
to {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town {{color id="-1"}}and order a dream home
of my own.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Meeting that special someone, settling
down in a nice, big house, and growing
gray together... {{delay15}}It's all I ever wanted!
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'm smiling just imagining it!{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Of course, before I buy a home, I'll need to figure
out the "special someone" part of the equation.

I told Papa to put up a picture of the Unity Bell for
good luck in my dating life... I wonder if he's done it.

He's my father. Shouldn't he be doing his best to
help me find a partner who has kind eyes and knows
how to bake?{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk15

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway... Back to it! I have to earn some
money if I'm going to buy a dream home!

didn't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I figured it was so early, no one would
be around.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Anyway... You're interested in buying a
{{color id="0"}}dream home{{color id="-1"}}, huh? Me too!

All I know is that Hudson Construction
started a new service where they build
them for you.
If you want to learn more, you should just
find them in {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}. That's to the
east of this stable.
Here's hoping we both end up in dream
homes of our own with amazing partners
who smell good and like dogs.
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}There I go again! Ow, my cheeks!{{size value="100"}}

That's the Hudson Construction jingle.
Hear it once, and you'll never be able to
get it out of your head.

look at it after my shift.
