I-it can't be...

*sigh* This darn rock...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Wh-whoa! Who are you?!{{delay8}} You know what?
I don't care!

If you're here, then I'm saved! {{delay8}}Ugh, I've
been stuck in here for ages!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Did you...{{delay8}}find my message in a bottle and
come to rescue me?

---
label: NPC_Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}It really worked...{{delay8}} I knew it was a long
shot, but it was worth it!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}After what went down in Lurelin Village,{{delay8}}
I couldn't exactly refresh my stock of fish,
so I went out to try to catch my own.
That's when a storm kicked up. {{delay8}}I tried to
shelter in this cave, but got shut in.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Yeah, things were pretty bad for a while,
but look at me now!{{delay8}} That bottle really
turned things around!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If this lucky streak keeps up, it's gotta
bode well for business!

---
label: NPC_Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh? {{delay8}}You didn't even see my message?{{delay8}}
No, of course you didn't...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I put my hopes and dreams into that little
bottle...{{delay8}}but I guess they're all sunk.

First there's the attack on Lurelin Village,{{delay8}}
which meant I couldn't restock my supply
of fish...
Then I go out to fish up my own, but the
only thing I catch is a storm. {{delay8}}So I go take
shelter in this cave, and BOOM, I'm stuck.
{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Now you tell me that my letter—my ONE
shot at getting out of here—never found a
reader?{{delay8}} It's just one thing after another...
...{{delay15}}Huh.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Wait, hold on.{{delay15}} The whole point of the
letter was to get someone to come help
me. You're someone... You can help me!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Maybe my luck's finally turning around!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Yeah! {{delay8}}Yeah, it has to be!{{delay8}} That's gotta
bode well for business.

label: NPC_Talk_0009

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}But, uh...{{delay15}} It looks like the rock's still
blocking the exit there.

I thought I could finally get out too...{{delay8}}
Guess I started celebrating a bit too early.

---
label: NPC_Talk_0009_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Which kinda raises the question...{{delay8}}
How did you get in here?

---
label: NPC_Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh*{{delay8}} I thought I was saved...


But I'm not going anywhere with that rock
in my way.

---
label: NPC_Talk_0011_0
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Hold on! {{delay8}}How long has the entrance
been unblocked?

---
label: NPC_Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Did...{{delay8}}did you move the rock for me?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Then that means...{{delay15}}I can finally get outta
here!{{delay15}} Oh! I've gotta thank you!

---
label: NPC_Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Here, this is for you!{{delay8}} I picked it up off the
ground here in the cave.

That sounded better in my head. It's a
nice reward, honest! I was planning to
take it home with me once I got out.

---
label: NPC_Talk_0003_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I really owe ya.{{delay8}} A little reward's the least
I can do!

---
label: NPC_Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}All right, I'm outta here.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If our paths ever do cross again, you
should buy some fish off me!{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh...{{delay8}}this isn't the time to play the
peddler, huh?{{delay15}}

Anyway, thanks again, and so long!
