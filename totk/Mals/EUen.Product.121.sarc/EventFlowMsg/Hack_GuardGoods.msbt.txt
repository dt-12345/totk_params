I'm stuck.

label: Near04
---
Huh?

label: Talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You there! {{delay8}}Are you here because you
noticed my signal fire?{{pageBreak}}It's about time someone did. See, I got
spotted by some {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}You...{{delay15}} You can defeat those flying
{{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}on your own?

Well, um... {{delay15}}Great!

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}They want to snatch the supplies
I collected from Snowfield Stable.{{pageBreak}}Those pests... {{delay8}}Normally I'd have dealt
with them, no problem.

label: Talk06

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But against a swarm, there wasn't much
I could do but set a signal fire and wait for
help to arrive.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Sadly, unless you have a pair of wings
I'm not seeing, I doubt you can reach the
{{color id="0"}}monsters up there{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'll just have to hang tight and wait for my
friends to notice I'm gone.

label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi_00"}}I just couldn't risk turning my attention
away from the supplies.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}So instead, I set a signal fire and waited
for help to arrive.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But trust me... {{delay8}}If I had my way, we'd be
having this conversation over two big
bowls of flying-thing soup.

Gotta think of something...

label: Talk03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Snowfield Stable was so generous to
donate these supplies...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}And then {{color id="0"}}flying monsters {{color id="-1"}}find me while
I'm taking them to Rito Village? What kind
of luck is that?

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Impressive!{{delay15}} So you can defeat those
{{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}way high up, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}All right!{{delay8}} I'll handle the rest of them!{{delay15}}
...Wait, no. I can't do that.

---
label: Talk12_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}As much as I'd like to handle the rest
of those {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}, I can't.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi_01"}}The moment I let my guard down, they'll
steal the supplies.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I'm glad you spotted my signal fire, but
{{color id="0"}}these monsters can fly{{color id="-1"}}, and you can't.{{delay8}}
See the problem?{{pageBreak}}Guess I'll just wait for my friends to see
me out here.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Grr! If I didn't have these supplies to
protect, they'd be monster meat by now!

label: Near03
---
Amazing!

label: Talk04

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}What the... You don't even have wings.
How'd you fight monsters so high up?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Eh, who cares? What matters is you did it!
Great work!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now I can get these supplies from
Snowfield Stable back to my village.{{pageBreak}}Please, let me give you something for
your efforts.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}It's less than you deserve, but it's also
all I have.

label: Talk07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Now, I better deliver these supplies before
more monsters show up. Take care!
