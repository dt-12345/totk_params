{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey there!{{delay8}} It's a remarkable day when we
see a traveler all the way out here.

So, I've got a pretty good guess what
brought you. You're searching for...{{delay15}}

the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}, right?

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}No, no.{{delay8}} If this fellow is of similar mind,
he's searching for more than that out
here in the wilds.
There's no doubt that he's really in
search of...{{delay8}}

the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}So, young man.{{delay8}} Tell me. You seek the
{{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}He does not!{{delay8}} A quick study of his face
gives him away.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}He's got the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}} on
his mind, and who could blame him?
I'm right, {{delay8}}right?

---
label: 0001
---
Horse god?

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's been strange talk for a good
while about a horse god—one that lives
here, among us.
I believe it's more than just legend, or
at least I hope so.{{delay8}} It's said this god can
bring horses back from the dead.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That all might seem laughable,
even preposterous.

But my friend and I study horses, and
if such a god exists here and can
resurrect horses...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Then what about...{{delay8}}ancient horses? The
mind reels at the possibilities.

I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in
horse gods for the sake of ancient
research. So, my search goes on.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But there's a complication...{{delay8}}


They say this god moved—that he was
here but vanished.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Fortunately, tales of the horse god also
abound in distant Akkala.

It's looking more and more likely that
the god is not here, if he exists at all.
He could be somewhere in Akkala.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}As we discussed earlier, the horse god
of legend may be living among us,
somewhere in this vast land.
The strange stories about this god
mention that he can resurrect a dead
horse—bring it right back to life.

---
label: 0002
---
A giant white stallion?

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh yes! My curiosity about this highly
notable horse has drawn me here.{{delay8}} I've
seen it {{color id="0"}}deep within this valley{{color id="-1"}}.
I can verify that it lives up to the
description. It's giant! It's white!
And it's a stallion!{{delay8}} Extremely rare.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The latest talk in our field of study calls
such rare traits a mutation.

We're doing research into the ecology of
all of the wild animals in this area.

Oh, that such a rare horse exists! We
want to study this creature and see its
unusual traits close up!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But as you can guess, the stallion is
very strong.

That marvelous creature refuses to have
anything to do with us. It escapes us
every time. It won't be tamed.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It's like I said...{{delay8}}there's an enormous white
horse {{color id="0"}}deep within this valley{{color id="-1"}}. You won't
believe your eyes!

---
label: 0003
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All right.{{delay8}} If that giant white stallion takes
a liking to you, come back with it and
visit us, OK?{{delay15}} We'd love to see it.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Well then, good talking.{{delay8}} We'd appreciate
it if you share with us anything more you
hear about the horse god.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Waaait just a minute there. You're not
saying that WE are going to Akkala, are
you? Because we're not!
Our main research is here. We've got to
see that {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yes, yes.{{delay8}} I know.{{delay8}} Our research into the
giant white stallion is paramount.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But if there's a {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}} somewhere,
I really want to know about it.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I knew it. You're seeking the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}.
Or...{{delay8}}is it the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion {{color id="-1"}}you seek?

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You have come here to look for the
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}, right?{{delay8}} Or maybe it's
the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}} you're looking for?

---
label: Talk_1200
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I could tell you're of like mind,{{delay8}} being
interested in the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_1201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I've encountered the giant white stallion.{{delay8}}
Truth be told, I wouldn't mind a face to
face with the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}} too.

---
label: Talk_1202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Now, about that {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}
It would be good if we could meet it too.
Maybe if one of us captured it...

---
label: Talk_1203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The god of horses, found at last...{{delay8}} Now,
maybe one of us will have luck capturing
that {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh...what is it, young man?{{delay8}} Have you
come looking for the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}} after all?
Or maybe the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey there! {{delay8}}So, you're here to search for
that {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}, eh? Or is your
heart set on that {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1300
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}So, young man...{{delay8}} You aren't riding the
giant white stallion. What a shame.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}At any rate, how is everything going with
you?{{delay8}} Learned anything more about the
{{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1301
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Well, I see you're not riding the
giant white stallion. That's a pity.

It's always a treat to observe such a
dashing, magnificent animal!{{delay8}} I'd love to
see that horse anytime you can manage it.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Anyway, what's happening in your travels
of late? Did you discover anything more
about the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1303
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Well then...young man,{{delay8}} anytime that you
and that giant white stallion ride up, it's
a remarkable sight.
You've done much for our research.{{delay8}}
Consider us in your debt.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So, how are you today?{{delay8}} Learn anything
more about the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1304
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Hey there! I swear, it will never get old,
seeing you and the giant white stallion
gallop up.
We owe you our most gracious thanks
for everything you've done to further our
study of that animal's habitat.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Anyway! Please tell me!{{delay8}} Have you
found out anything more about that
{{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}, by any chance?

---
label: Talk_1305
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hmm... What is it, young man?{{delay8}} Have
you come this way now looking for that
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1306
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey there!{{delay8}} Have you come back this way
to search for the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1307
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}So...not riding the giant white stallion
today?{{delay8}} What a shame. I would have liked
to see that incredible horse again.

---
label: Talk_1308
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh!{{delay8}} It looks like you're not traveling with
the giant white stallion right now.{{delay8}} Well,
that's a pity.
That animal just couldn't be more dashing
and magnificent!{{delay8}} I wouldn't mind seeing
that horse now and then.

---
label: Talk_1309
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Incredible. That is a big horse. I don't
think I'll ever feel anything but awe being
next to that animal.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}It's so big, in fact, that horse-riding
equipment just wouldn't fit its
immense frame.

---
label: Talk_1310
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}*sigh* The form and sheer muscle on
that creature is astounding.{{delay8}} Truly, an
impressive horse.
At full stride, it must be able to throw off
monsters like they're nothing and still
just keep on galloping.

---
label: Talk_1311
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}That's one very large horse, no doubt
about it.

Its stamina must be considerable, given
the size of that animal!

---
label: Talk_1312
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You can tell that giant white stallion
has a giant temper to match.

I can't imagine that it listens to just
anyone. Training such a horse must
be like trying to quiet a storm!

---
label: Talk_200
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}You there... Young man.{{delay8}} Have you come
to search for the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}?

Or is it the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}} you seek?

---
label: Talk_210
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Have you come to find the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}
after all? Or are you searching for the
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Right. It's a white horse, with an
unusually large body. We found it deep
inside this valley.
We've come to this place to study that
giant white stallion, and to do that, we
hope to capture it for a time.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}We've had no luck so far. That horse is
powerful and won't be caught easily.
At least, not by us.

---
label: Talk_203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Indeed. If you learn anything about the
horse god, I'd be thankful if you'd return
to share it with us.
And if you have any luck with that
giant white stallion, of course. I wish
you good fortune in your travels.

---
label: Talk_204
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Although...{{delay8}}I'm sure Straia will insist that
we need to capture the {{color id="0"}}giant white
stallion{{color id="-1"}} first.

---
label: Talk_205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Let's give it a shot...{{delay8}}but I still feel we're
better off looking for the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What on...{{delay15}} Straia! Wake up!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Oh! You...{{delay8}}met the horse god?!


H-{{delay8}}hey!{{delay8}} Get up, Straia!{{delay8}} This is no time
to sleep!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey there!{{delay8}} Are you looking for that
{{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}? Or is it the {{color id="0"}}god
of horses{{color id="-1"}} you seek?

---
label: Talk_310
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So, you've come around here in search
of that {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}, right?{{delay8}} Or is
it that {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}} you're after?

---
label: Talk_301
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's a legend around these parts
about a god of horses.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}They say this god can restore life to
dead horses.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's only a legend though—and a legend
about a god seems like it could be a
slippery thing.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Really, it's Jini there you want to talk to
if you'd like to know more.

So, feel free to huddle around the fire
there if you'd like to pass the time until
he wakes up!

---
label: Talk_302
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Well, that god of horses is fine and all,{{delay8}} but
I want to catch the {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_303

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Still, once we catch that horse, I'd also
like to start that investigation into the
{{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whaaat?{{delay8}} It...{{delay8}}it can't be!{{delay15}} Wake up, Jini!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's the giant white stallion we've
been trying to research!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Seeing it this close up, that horse is
just so...{{delay8}}intimidating.{{delay8}} It's so large!
I feel so small!
{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Words fail me.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}One thing I can say with certainty is
that a mutation is in play here. What
a discovery!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Th-{{delay8}}there's no mistaking it!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's the giant white stallion we've
been trying to research!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}We've been studying the ecology of all
the wild animals in this area, but that
horse is the most interesting to us!
We'd heard of this exceptional creature
and came to try to capture it for a short
time to study its traits.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Now, seeing it this close up, that horse
is just so...{{delay8}}intimidating!{{delay8}} Its sheer
presence is...
Well, words fail me.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can say this for sure. What we call a
mutation—a new term in our work—must
be the cause of such surprising size!

---
label: Talk_1003

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}A horse of this size...{{delay8}}capturing it must
have been hard, and riding it—next

Young man,{{delay8}} you are remarkable.

---
label: Talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We still haven't learned about what I am

that with us.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That giant white stallion truly is a

I wish I could capture one of those and

just one such animal in the world.

label: Talk_1101

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}The giant white stallion...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}I don't believe it.{{delay8}} The legend is real.

I'd say that we must be cautious.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Right! Given we haven't captured the

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Yes! We should focus our attention on
the habitat of the giant white stallion.{{delay8}}
There's so much to study here!

---
label: Talk_2006

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Agreed, yes.{{delay8}} The local habitat of the
