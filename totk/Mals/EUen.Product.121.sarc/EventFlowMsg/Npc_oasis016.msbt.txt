{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey! So...{{delay8}}you're a special voe,
aren't you?!

Otherwise the soldiers would be arresting
you right now!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So...{{delay8}}why are you special?

---
label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Dalia! You'd better not be speaking
to that voe!

Didn't Ms. Ashai teach you the first rule
about voe?

"For young vai, speaking with a voe will
only invite misfortune!"

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Humming"}}I'm not talking to the voe! I'm just talking!
I can't even see, so it's not my fault who
comes walking by!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Listen up, voe...{{delay8}} You shouldn't go poking
your nose into Gerudo life.

You're free to come and go as you wish,
but please don't disrupt the peace of
our town.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey! So...{{delay8}}does your arm have those neat
designs on it because you're a voe?

Ms. Ashai...
