{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah, it's you!


That battle we were caught up in recently
was amazing.

You beat those monsters AND opened our
eyes. I've gotta thank you for all of that.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Olkin and I have been at odds for ages.
Now we're tending each other's field
because of you.
I wouldn't have guessed I'd ever find
any pleasure in his company.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}One more thing. When Olkin and I were
talkin', we figured out a {{color id="0"}}method for
defending while attacking{{color id="-1"}}.
Any interest in hearin' about it?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}With only a weapon in hand, you can't
defend yourself...{{delay15}}normally.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But {{color id="0"}}attach a shield to your weapon{{color id="-1"}}, then
you might be able to defend yourself
after all.
I'd have never come up with that idea on
my own. Groundbreaking stuff! I gotta
give most of the credit to Olkin.
Combining your strength with that of
others is pretty key, in my opinion.

---
label: talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's more or less what I said before.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You can defend yourself while attacking if
you {{color id="0"}}attach a shield to your weapon{{color id="-1"}}. It's
a new idea, mostly thanks to Olkin.
See how useful it is to combine your
strength with that of others? A good
thing to do, no matter what your goal is.

---
label: talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ha, but I guess you'd know all about that
already, a warrior as skilled as you.

Hope my talk here wasn't too much
bother. Now, you stay well, all right?

---
label: talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ha, I guess a warrior as skilled as you
would know all about this.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But here's another thing. I can't say that
I like your look.

We'd never mistake you for that scum,
but others in this village fear those
who wear such things.

---
label: talk14

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That look of yours isn't gonna be
welcome here.

We'd never mistake you for those scum,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm gonna be workin' in Olkin's field too,
now and then.

Olkin and I didn't help much at all with
those creatures outside the village. We
can help each other now, in our fields.
Never thought I'd hoe the same row
with Olkin on anything.

But I gotta credit him with us comin'
up with the {{color id="0"}}method of defending
while attacking{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Any interest in hearin' about it?

---
label: Talk01_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What is it? I've got work here in Olkin's
field to do.

But glad to tell you about our {{color id="0"}}method of
defending while attacking{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Any interest in hearin' about it?

label: Talk01_15

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Olkin's the one around here who really
knows what I'm made of. It's not a
stretch to say he's a friend.
They say keep your friends close and
your enemies closer—but turns out that
enemies can turn into friends too.
Thanks to him, we've come up with a new
{{color id="0"}}method of defending while attacking{{color id="-1"}}.

Any interest in hearin' about that?
Glad to share it.

---
label: Talk01_11

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Didn't expect you to come talkin' to
me again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}What is it? Still need something?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is Olkin's field where he grows his
fortified pumpkins.

We came up with a new{{color id="0"}} method of
defending while attacking {{color id="-1"}}right here, as
I listened to him talk about pumpkins.
Any interest in hearin' about that
method? Glad to tell you all about it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You want swift carrots? You gotta go

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}These swift carrots need more time in

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you eat a swift carrot cooked into a
dish, you can {{color id="0"}}move more quickly{{color id="-1"}}.

The carrot's essence will race through
your body, helping you move like
the wind.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm sure that if someone like you eats
that kind of dish, no one would be able
to keep up!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I get why. You know how important
