Long, long ago...when the kingdom of Hyrule was
still young...

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_001_b
---
A great evil, the Demon King, emerged. He attacked
the innocent and sought the destruction of Hyrule.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_002_b
---
He was our chief...before he changed. His obsession
with power transformed him into a monster.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_003_b
---
Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—and six warriors rose
to oppose him. I'm proud to have been one of them.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_004_b
---
We faced the Demon King but only after Rauru gave
us the means to fight the monster.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_005_b
---
Secret stones... Artifacts that amplified the abilities of
those who carried them.

We faced the Demon King but only after Rauru gave
us the secret stones.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_005_d
---
Artifacts that amplified the abilities of
those who carried them.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_006_b
---
I—the Sage of Lightning—fought by my fellow sages
in battle with my own secret stone.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_007_b
---
But we were no match for his overwhelming power.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_008_b
---
He endured our strongest attacks. Even the lightning
strikes I called down...

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_010_c
---
King Rauru knew we had lost the battle against the
Demon King.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_011_b
---
He made the ultimate sacrifice, to imprison
the Demon King... To seal him away.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_012_b
---
That was the Imprisoning War...

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_014_c
---
The rest of us survived that historic battle. Not long
after, a visitor came to me. And she set the Gerudo on
our destined path.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_c
---
Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_d
---
Some time later...

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_e
---
Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time—came to
visit me, and she set the Gerudo on our destined path.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_017_c
---
The magic restraining the Demon King will eventually
be undone.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_018_c
---
When that time comes, you must help Link. He is a
noble swordsman who will fight that monster.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_019_c
---
So please... He will need your assistance. Lend him
your power... The Gerudo's control of lightning!

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_020_b
---
The path of the Gerudo was clear at that moment...

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_021_c
---
We wish nothing more than to eliminate the
Demon King.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_022_b
---
We are responsible for his very existence in this
world, and for that we must make amends.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_023_b
---
I swear to you that when the Demon King returns,
the Gerudo Sage of Lightning will awaken once more.

---
label: Dm_GE_0025_Text_024_b
---
The Gerudo sage and her people will fight alongside
your swordsman.
