Is it a baby, maybe?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Ah, I knew I'd find you here! I think you
might love fossils even more than I do.

label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}So, hey, take a look at this fossil.{{delay15}}
Doesn't it kind of look like a {{color id="0"}}child{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0000
---
A child?

---
label: 0001
---
None of my business.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_01"}}Yeah.{{delay15}} I mean, just look at it...{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Do you think the little one could be {{color id="0"}}the
bigger leviathan's child{{color id="-1"}}? I mean, it's hard
to tell from just the skull, but...

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}They look pretty similar to me.{{delay15}}
Extremely similar, in fact!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Just imagine the fossils of the {{color id="0"}}parent and
child leviathans, side by side{{color id="-1"}}!

Could the child fossil's {{color id="0"}}body and tail {{color id="-1"}}still
be somewhere nearby? I sure hope so!

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've traveled so far, I just can't go home
without seeing them together and intact!
I'll pay any price!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh.{{delay8}} Maybe you're not as big of a fossil fan
as I thought... Too bad.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Oh, what are you doing over there?

---
label: Near01
---
The final leviathan...

---
label: Near02
---
It's a precious little baby!

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Just imagine it! {{delay15}}The fossils of the {{color id="0"}}parent
and child leviathans, side by side{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}I wonder if the child fossil's {{color id="0"}}body and tail{{color id="-1"}}
are still somewhere nearby...

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aha! I just knew the body and tail would
be around here somewhere!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I bet if you {{color id="0"}}connected them to the skull{{color id="-1"}},
the fossil would look a lot more like its
baby leviathan self!{{pageBreak}}Oh, just imagine how cute they'd be...{{delay15}} The
parent and child leviathans, side by side!

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ahhh!{{delay15}} I knew it! The fossil WAS a baby
leviathan after all! Just look at them! You
can totally see the family resemblance!
Oh, I can just picture the two of them
swimming through the ancient oceans...

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}You put the baby leviathan fossil back
together for me, didn't you?{{pageBreak}}It's so darling, I can hardly stand it! Here!
Take this reward before I lose my mind!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}My...my life is complete.{{delay15}} Visiting the
Eldin, {{delay8}}Hebra,{{delay8}} and Gerudo regions...
Meeting all my cute little leviathans...
And this parent and child combo may be
the cutest of all!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I just want to stay with this adorable
leviathan fossil family forever!
