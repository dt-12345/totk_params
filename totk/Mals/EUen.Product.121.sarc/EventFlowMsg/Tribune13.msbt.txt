{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there, partner! Did you head this way
after hearing the rumors?

Even without wings, you've traveled all
the way out here... {{delay8}}That shows some
serious reporter spirit!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there, partner! You're working really
hard and really late, aren't you?

Even without wings, you've traveled all

serious reporter spirit!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there, partner! You're working really
hard...{{delay8}}and in the rain, to boot?

On top of that, even without wings, you've

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Well, let me give you the scoop... Some
folks have heard a voice near here that
sounds like Princess Zelda.
I heard the chirps and warbles from my
little birds and headed straight here, but
something is fishy...
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}For starters, the strange voice is crowing
from {{color id="0"}}Fural Plain to the northwest{{color id="-1"}}, night
after night after night.
"Leave the...rms... {{delay8}}Leave the...rms..."


At least, that's what I heard. I didn't get
too close.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Got outta there fast. Felt like a curse just blowing
through on the wind. No, sir. Not going to think
about it.{{size value="100"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Anyway, all the travelers who heard the
eerie voice have gotten spooked by it!

They've been throwing their weapons
down the well and then running away as
fast as they can.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Could the voice really belong to Princess
Zelda? She's not usually so...haunting.

All we can do is seek out the truth,
partner! Even if it is a little scary...

label: Challenge_0005

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Hey, partner... {{delay15}}You're finding this all a
little scary, aren't you?

Can't blame you one bit if you are. Me?{{delay8}}
Not at all! {{delay8}}Totally fine.{{delay15}} Just worried about
you is all.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What I'm saying is I think we should
investigate this story together!

---
label: Challenge_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Just give me a shout before you head out!{{delay8}}
Actually, don't shout. We shouldn't talk
too loudly...

---
label: Challenge_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I think we should leave at night.{{delay8}} I'll be
waiting right here, so just come and get
me {{color id="0"}}when night falls{{color id="-1"}}.

The princess's voice...

label: Challenge_0010

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Princess Zelda's voice can be heard
coming from {{color id="0"}}Fural Plain to the northwest{{color id="-1"}}
night after night after night...
"Leave the...rms... {{delay8}}Leave the...rms..."


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh no. {{delay8}}What if it's one of those curses
where saying the words out loud causes it
to affect you?
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}If it is...{{delay8}}then I'm already c-c-cursed!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}N-no.{{delay8}} It's OK. {{delay8}}That's probably not the
case. {{delay15}}Sorry for getting my feathers
ruffled, partner.
Anyway, the strange voice can only be
heard at night, so come and get me when
it's time to head out. Don't forget!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Princess Zelda's voice can be heard

night after night after night...
Hey, partner?{{delay8}} Do you get goosebumps?
You're not a Rito, but I'm curious if you
feel it too...
Ah, never mind. That's not what matters
right now.

What is important is that we look into this
mystery together. {{delay8}}Just let me know before
you head out, OK?

Only heard at night...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}A pretty great night, isn't it, partner? It's
around the time the eerie voice has been
heard on {{color id="0"}}Fural Plain to the northwest{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Folks say it happens night after night
after night...

Could it really be Princess Zelda though?
And if it is her, why is she doing it?

Hm. I guess the only way to find out is to
check for ourselves. {{delay8}}Ready, partner?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I see. {{delay8}}That's no problem, partner. {{delay8}}If you
don't feel like pursuing the scoop right
now, that is A-OK...

---
label: Challenge_0030

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Changed your mind?{{delay8}} All right then, let's
head out and investigate the place the
rumors mentioned.

D-d-did you hear that, partner?!{{delay8}}

---
label: Challenge_0041
---
{{anim type="Scare"}}Th-that's the voice, all right!{{delay8}} And it's
close by!

Is it Princess Zelda though? Might be!{{delay8}}
B-but where's it coming from?

---
label: Challenge_0047
---
M-my legs won't move! {{delay15}}My w-wings won't
flap!{{delay15}} I'd duck out of here if I could, but
I can't!

---
label: Challenge_0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}Just where is this unsettling voice coming
from?{{delay15}} It's close, no doubt about that...

---
label: Challenge_0065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Hmm, we can't hear the voice anymore.
It seems like the time of day has some
significance...
We don't know where the voice is coming
from or what's causing it, but at least
we're safe.
For now, all we can do is resume our
investigation at nightfall, partner.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}Heeey! {{delay15}}That you down there, partner?

Not very nice of you to head off on your
own after we agreed to go together!

---

What's going on? Tell me everything!

---
label: Challenge_0070

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Out with it, partner! {{delay8}}What'd you discover?
Is Princess Zelda down there?

---
label: Challenge_0071
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}It's just someone, er, singing in a well?
She's just practicing?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Huh... I see...


{{anim type="Think_00"}}And her voice echoed off the well walls,
making it sound like the princess's voice.
Acoustics are strange...
And that same distortion made the lyrics
she was singing sound more like threats
to everyone who heard her.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ha! So the mystery is solved! {{delay8}} Now I know
why I had all those goosebumps! I sensed
one heck of a story coming my way!
Thanks for your help, partner!

---
label: Challenge_0072
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}OK, I'll head on back to the office and
write this one up.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'd better hurry too! We wouldn't want
more people thinking the princess was
casting spells from a well!
Until next time, partner!
