Great decoration there.

A skeleton...horse?

That's a special horse.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I'd like to get a close look at the animals
over there. But darn it all. They run off
when people get close.

label: Talk1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Fascinating creatures...{{delay8}} Stocky build,
bulky animals, all of them...

What I wouldn't give to get a closer look.{{delay8}}
Better yet, to touch one.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Hi there.{{pageBreak}}Didn't really notice you walk up, buddy.
I've been looking across the way there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I wonder, are you curious about the {{color id="0"}}
unusual animals{{color id="-1"}} over there too?

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oh,{{delay8}} so you're curious about them too?
Then you must have a keen mind.

label: Talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Those are a species of animal that few
have ever seen called {{color id="0"}}Dondons{{color id="-1"}}. They
were discovered in this area.
A young woman on the opposite bank
has been taking care of them. She really
knows her stuff.
If you'd like to learn more, buddy,
I'd suggest that you talk to her.

label: Talk1030

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I'd like to get close enough to touch one.
If only once!

---
label: Talk1100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Tell me, buddy. Are you interested in
those {{color id="0"}}unusual animals {{color id="-1"}}after all?

---
label: Talk1110
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Those are a new species of animal that
few have ever seen called {{color id="0"}}Dondons{{color id="-1"}}. They

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}A young woman on the opposite bank has
been taking care of them. She knows her
stuff, all right. She could tell you more.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Speaking of new kinds of creatures...{{pageBreak}}A pair of fellows visited the stable
recently and said they're searching
for some {{color id="0"}}unusual creatures{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}They're seeking a {{color id="0"}}giant white stallion{{color id="-1"}} and
nothing less than the {{color id="0"}}horse god{{color id="-1"}}.

Unusual, indeed. That stallion sounds
much larger than a horse. And that god is
surely much greater than a creature!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Those two headed west of here, toward
the {{color id="0"}}Lake of the Horse God{{color id="-1"}}. You could go
talk to them if this sounds intriguing.

label: Talk1125_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Wait...{{delay8}} Is that a giant white stallion you
have with you, buddy?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That's as impressive as a Dondon!{{delay8}} Thanks
for showing me something so rare.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hello, hello... Like being out in the rain
like this?

---
label: Talk1130_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's a lot of rain ahead.{{delay8}} Don't tough it
out. Just rest at the stable.

label: Talk1131
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh,{{delay8}} are you out and about in this
weather? You watch yourself, buddy.{{delay8}}
Lightning! And more lightning!

---
label: Talk1131_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It's rough if lightning strikes any of your
metallic possessions. Don't risk it. Just
rest at the stable.

label: Talk1131_02

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It can be hard to see through all of the
trees around here, and at night, it's even
trickier. Be careful as you travel.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hi there.{{delay8}} Where are you off to so early?{{delay15}}
As for me, I'm thinking of getting a
closer look at the Dondons.

---
label: Talk1133
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The Dondons are on the opposite bank.
You should go see them if you're curious.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}You've got to excuse me. My old bones
need a rest.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}{{size value="80"}}Dondons... Soft as a...pillow...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Darn it all. I can't see a single one of
those Dondons in the rain...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Lightning, lightning! The dragon god must
be angry today!

Up close, if I can...

---
label: Near0002

I'd like to touch a Dondon.
