Down it comes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Oh, hello there. Are you out on an
adventure too?

label: Talk18

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Good evening. Are you out on an
adventure too?

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm not just on a journey across the land,
but a journey through time! {{delay8}}I'm trying to
get my eyes on all the old stuff I can.
I wanted to see if they had anything like
that at the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Buuut it seems like some weirdos took
the place over, so I'm pretty much at a
standstill here.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}So...{{delay15}} Do YOU like {{color id="0"}}ancient things{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0000
---
Ancient things?

---
label: 0001
---
I'm a modern guy.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You know...{{delay8}}ancient things!{{delay8}} Things that are
ancient! Oh, just one look at them and it's
like I've been transported through time.
That's the thrill I'm looking for. But what
should I go see next?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, I've got it!{{delay8}} Did you hear that they
found {{color id="0"}}fossils of giant leviathans{{color id="-1"}} that once
lived in this land? It's true!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}How many, you ask? Not one, not two,
but THREE giant fossils, just waiting for
me to say hello!
But which to meet first... Maybe I'll go
introduce myself to the {{color id="0"}}itty-bitty leviathan
in{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}, to start.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Here, let me see your {{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}for a second.

label: Talk04

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}He should be right around here.

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh, {{delay15}}I can only imagine what he looks
like—how beautiful he must be!{{pageBreak}}Why don't you pay him a visit as well?{{delay8}}
I'm sure it will set your heart all aflutter!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'm too keyed up to stand around here.{{delay15}}
Time to go make my dreams a reality!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}What a shame.{{delay8}} So the delights of history
are lost on you, then...{{delay15}} Well, goodbye.

---
label: Near01
---
His eyes...

---
label: Near02
---
I wish I could see both...

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I had a feeling you'd turn up. Take a look!

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's pretty impressive that the leviathan's
{{color id="0"}}eyes were fossilized too{{color id="-1"}}, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wrong!

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Because look again—the left eyeball
is missing!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh*{{delay15}} And after I came all this way.{{delay8}}
I wish I could have seen him with both of
{{color id="0"}}his cute little eyes{{color id="-1"}} still in his head.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That {{color id="0"}}other eyeball{{color id="-1"}} has to be around here
somewhere, right?

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh*{{delay15}} It took so long to walk all the way
out here...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I wish I could have seen him with {{color id="0"}}both
of his eyes in his head{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Why, I'd pay a small fortune for a chance
like that!

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Wait...{{delay15}} HUH?!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Eeeeee! I can see both of his little eyes!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Oh, just look at him!{{delay15}} That big, ferocious
face—those cute, round eyes...{{pageBreak}}I'm not sure whether to cower in fear or
pat him on his adorable baby head!{{delay15}}
He's not just complete, he's PERFECT!

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}So you found his eye and put him back
together again? Thank you!{{pageBreak}}Here, take this.{{delay8}} It's the least I can do
after you made my historical dreams
come true!

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I could stay here staring all day...{{delay15}}but
there's still two more leviathans to meet!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I can hardly wait to see the next one.
But how to choose?{{pageBreak}}Hmm... Maybe the wee {{color id="0"}}leviathan in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}
is feeling lonely.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Let me see your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}. I'll show you where
to find him.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}He's supposed to be around
here somewhere.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh,{{delay15}} I just can't wait to see how cute the
little guy is!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}In fact, what am I waiting for?{{delay15}} I'm off to
see him now! So long!
