Zelda asked me to aid you, Link.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_001_c
---
I am the Sage of Spirit and one of the Zonai.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_002_b
---
Mineru.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_003_b
---
I am glad to meet you, Link.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_004_d
---
I must thank you.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_d
---
It is because of you that we have recovered my
secret stone.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_e
---
Originally, my intent was to awaken when you first
found the Purah Pad...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_f
---
then to guide you to my construct and assist you on
your journey. I had not anticipated a battle with that
same construct...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_g
---
You have proven quite adept, and I am grateful for
all your efforts.

label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_006_b

Link...here.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_007_b
---
In the name of Mineru, Sage of Spirit, I grant my
power unto you.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_008_c
---
I believe it will serve you well.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_009_c
---
With this power I've given, a deep bond has been
forged between us.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0030_Text_012_b
---
And from this point forward, my spirit will reside within
that construct. I will help you however I can.
