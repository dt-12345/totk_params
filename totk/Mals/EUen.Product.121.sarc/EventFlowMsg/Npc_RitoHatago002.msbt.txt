{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Welcome to {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Good morning. This is Rito Stable.

label: Talk09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello. Welcome to Rito Stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Good evening. Welcome to Rito Stable.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Ugh, this weather's just the worst.{{delay8}} But
welcome to Rito Stable anyway.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}No, that's not right. I meant to say
"{{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}."

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Yeah... {{delay15}}Sorry.


I just moved over here from {{color id="0"}}Rito Stable{{color id="-1"}},
so I keep saying the wrong name.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I meant to say {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I did it again...{{delay8}} I'm sorry.


It feels weird to be working somewhere
other than {{color id="0"}}Rito Stable{{color id="-1"}}, but I guess I need
to get used to it.

label: Talk03
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Oh. {{delay8}}I said it right...{{size value="100"}}


{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}{{color id="-1"}}I came from {{color id="0"}}Rito Stable {{color id="-1"}}pretty recently,
so I always say the wrong stable's name.{{delay8}}
But this time, I got it right.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Welcome to New Serenne Stable!


Did I...{{delay8}}say it right?{{size value="100"}}


{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}{{color id="-1"}}I just moved here from {{color id="0"}}Rito Stable{{color id="-1"}}, so I
always get the name of the stable wrong.
But this time, I nailed it!

Rito Stable?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It was a stable much like this one, but in
front of {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}west {{color id="-1"}}of here.
The {{color id="0"}}big cold snap {{color id="-1"}}shut it down though.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I think it was replaced by a newspaper
company or something.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}} was always cold, but it's gotten
really bad. If you go to {{color id="0"}}Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}, you
need to {{color id="0"}}prepare for extreme weather{{color id="-1"}}.

Gotta go.

label: Talk06

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, by the way, please take this.

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Or not. I think you're carrying a little too
much right now.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Once you've made some room, please
come see me. I've prepared some
{{color id="0"}}medicine {{color id="-1"}}that will keep you warm.

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh, you organized your things for me?
Here you go, then.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I don't need it anymore, so...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you'd like to use the stable, please talk
to the shopkeeper at the center counter.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry to just keep going on and on when
the rain is already noisy enough...

label: Talk23

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You should relax a little, listen to the
music of the {{color id="0"}}Stable Trotters{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you can't fall asleep, I bet listening
to the {{color id="0"}}Stable Trotters{{color id="-1"}} perform will help
you unwind.

label: Talk27

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}This is a musical troupe that combines
{{color id="0"}}four different instruments {{color id="-1"}}into one
amazing performance!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Come back to Rito...{{delay8}} *sigh* Come back to
New Serenne Stable whenever you like.
