Did you learn anything?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}She saddled me with so much work
when she put me in charge of the
mayoral election...

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, hello. Don't I remember you
from before?{{pageBreak}}I'm sorry for all the commotion you got
mixed up in.

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Um, sir?{{pageBreak}}I feel like I should apologize for dragging
you into this mess I've found myself in.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But since we are both involved now,
could you give me a little advice?

---
label: 0000
---
SURE!

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Aaah! I should have expected that.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The thing I need your advice on is my
sister... It's about {{color id="0"}}Cece{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Lately, she's been sneaking off{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}alone in
the {{color id="0"}}middle of the night{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I don't think it's anything sinister, but the
election is soon, and I don't want any
last-minute surprises to hurt her chances.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}So I'd like you to {{color id="0"}}tail {{color id="-1"}}my sister, find out
where she's going and what she's up to,
and get back to me.{{pageBreak}}I've tried following her myself, but {{color id="0"}}she
spotted me {{color id="-1"}}right away!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I really got an earful about it too.

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So what happened was...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}Umm... {{delay8}}This is actually something I could use your
help with...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0002
---
Why the whispering?

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Shhh! {{delay8}}We can't talk about this around my sister.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Find me outside the shop when it's light out. We can
talk then.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Sorry, but we shouldn't talk about this around
my sister.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Find me outside the shop when it's light out. We can
talk then.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you succeed in finding out what she's
doing, I can reward you, of course.{{pageBreak}}You're the only one I can ask for help.
I don't want any of the villagers finding
out until I know what's going on.{{pageBreak}}Help me out, please!

---
label: 0001
---
Now's a bad time...

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh. Of course.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}I thought you maybe had the same
tendency as me to get caught up in
things. I felt almost a kinship with you.

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm so sorry to ask you to {{color id="0"}}follow {{color id="-1"}}my sister. I know
how shady it sounds.{{pageBreak}}She's right over there, so I have to keep this quiet,
but she's incredibly {{color id="0"}}alert {{color id="-1"}}when walking.{{pageBreak}}Be sure you {{color id="0"}}don't enter her line of sight{{color id="-1"}}.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh! I haven't seen you in a while.{{pageBreak}}It's been some time since I troubled you
to {{color id="0"}}follow {{color id="-1"}}my sister to wherever she
sneaks off to {{color id="0"}}at night{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I was beginning to think you only
pretended to accept my request as
a cruel joke.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've tried {{color id="0"}}following {{color id="-1"}}her several times
myself, you know. But she's incredibly
{{color id="0"}}alert {{color id="-1"}}and spotted me immediately.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Since I can't do it myself, and since the
mayoral election is so close, I really need
your help with this.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm so sorry to ask you to get involved
in what's really my problem.{{pageBreak}}I know it's a big favor to ask you to {{color id="0"}}follow{{color id="-1"}}
my sister to wherever she's sneaking off
to in the {{color id="0"}}middle of the night{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}But the mayoral election is so close that
this would be a bad time for any surprises
about her to get out.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}You should know that she's incredibly
{{color id="0"}}alert {{color id="-1"}}on these walks of hers, so be careful
{{color id="0"}}not to enter her line of sight{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Perfect. {{delay8}}I do believe nobody saw me.{{pageBreak}}I'm free to enjoy another of my late-night
meals in {{delay8}}se{{delay8}}cret!

---
label: Talk_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahhh, how I enjoy my nightly vegetables.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The shine, the luster, the fragrance...
Yes indeed. {{delay15}}Now this is luxury dining!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}And so, without further ado, let us tuck in.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}*crunch* *munch* *cronch*

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}So scrumptious. {{delay8}}The crisp, smooth
taste is a sign they were grown on a diet
of pure water.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Thanks to the farmer's deft touch and the
quality of the soil, I can even eat the skin
without misgivings.{{pageBreak}}Honestly, vegetables from anywhere but
Hateno Village simply don't count. They're
nowhere near as filling.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Though I've built a reputation on flash and
glamour, here in private, I must admit that
the simple, unadorned things are best.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}There's simply no denying it, alas.

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But now that I'm full for tonight, it's best
that I return home.{{pageBreak}}If I don't return quickly, Sophie may start
to suspect something.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sorry about this. I know it's a tall order,
asking you to {{color id="0"}}tail {{color id="-1"}}my sister, but I'm just
so nervous about her.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Really? {{delay8}}The silo across the way?

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So that's where my sister has been
spending her time.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But what I still want to know is, {{color id="0"}}what is
she doing {{color id="-1"}}in there?{{pageBreak}}The window is {{color id="0"}}up too high{{color id="-1"}} for me to see
inside. And I don't see how I'd climb up
there without a ladder.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There must be some way to see what
she's up to in secret...

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}What could my sister be getting up to
inside that silo?{{pageBreak}}The window is {{color id="0"}}up too high{{color id="-1"}} for me to see
inside. But how else am I going to find
out what's going on with her?

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}What? {{delay8}}I thought she'd been hiding
something big. Is that really all there
was to it?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I know my sister says a lot about charisma
and style, and has to do everything in the
most ostentatious way possible.{{pageBreak}}But between you and me...{{delay8}}her tastes are
pretty plain. She loves the slow life here
in Hateno Village.{{pageBreak}}She probably told you she came back here
because of development or whatever.{{pageBreak}}But the truth is, she just wanted to eat
the vegetables grown right here in her
hometown again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}At least, I'm pretty sure that's the case.{{delay15}}
Either way, I'm so glad she wasn't up to
anything scandalous.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I want you to have this in exchange for
helping me out.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh...I had a reward for you, but your bag
doesn't have room for it.{{pageBreak}}Guess I won't be giving you these
10 ironshrooms.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not until you come back after making
space for them, at least!

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I planned to reward you with 10
ironshrooms for doing what I asked.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But that'll have to wait until you come
back with room for them in your pouch.

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It looks like you've got some space in
your pouch now.{{pageBreak}}Which means the time has come...{{delay8}}to give
you the reward for the favor I asked!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My sister really is a handful sometimes.{{pageBreak}}Both she and Reede want the same
things, you know.{{pageBreak}}I can't understand why the two of them
don't just work together instead of going
to such bizarre lengths.

are almost over. I have an errand to run,
