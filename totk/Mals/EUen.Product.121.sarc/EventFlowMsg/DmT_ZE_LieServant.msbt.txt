Allow me to offer you my deepest apologies...

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_001_b
---
on behalf of the Gerudo...

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_002_b
---
for taking so long to accept your repeated invitations.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_003_c
---
It is our desire to be accepted into the protective
embrace of your kingdom. To serve it faithfully.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_004_b
---
A welcome appeal, Ganondorf. I will accept your
vow of fealty to the kingdom of Hyrule.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_005_b
---
I understand that a single male is born to the Gerudo
every one hundred years.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_006_b
---
Receiving such an appeal from you, a hero to his
people and a king by birth...

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_007_b
---
Well, it is truly reassuring.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_008_b
---
It is my honor.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_009_b
---
When your Zonai ancestors first descended upon
these lands long, long ago, they must have seemed
to be gods.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_010_b
---
And now you rule as king and have taken a Hyrulean
woman as your wife.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_011_aab
---


---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_011_b
---
Your Majesty has certainly risen above your
admirable lineage.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_012_b
---
Most impressive.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_013_b
---


---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_014_b
---
It is unfortunate that the noble Zonai no longer grace
this world with their presence.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_015_b
---
All except you and your sister, that is.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_016_b
---
Even if something were to happen to me, both my
kingdom and the peace it brings—these will endure
for generations to come.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_017_b

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_019_b
---
Your actions today are appreciated, Ganondorf.
I look forward to your future endeavors.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_020_b
---
You may leave.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_021_b
---
Your Majesty.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_022_b
---
King Rauru...

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_023_b
---
I believe that man's heart holds many dark ambitions.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_024_b
---
Just his name... Even that... It gives me pause.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_025_c
---
I am well aware of his evil nature.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_026_c
---
For that reason, and others, I want him close.
It will be easier to keep an eye on him.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_027_c
---


---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_028_d
---
There is nothing to worry about.

---
label: DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_029_b
---
OK.
