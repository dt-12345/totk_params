{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Say, you ever heard of the {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}}
He's supposed to be near East Akkala

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}They say he makes horses stronger...{{delay15}} 
Maybe I can ask him to work his magic on
my beloved mare.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}She just loves endura carrots. Can't get

That {{color id="0"}}god of horses {{color id="-1"}}who's supposed to be

He's a horse himself, right? Or no?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, {{number2 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} would be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
That OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}OK, {{number2 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} would come to a total of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I trade around {{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}, to the northeast,

label: Talk_1002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Like my {{color id="0"}}towing harness{{color id="-1"}} that much, do ya?{{pageBreak}}Then you gotta hit the stables and build
up some {{color id="0"}}Pony Points{{color id="-1"}} of your own!{{pageBreak}}You can earn points by using the stable
facilities, handing 'em new wild horses,
and staying the night there.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Build up enough points and you'll get
your own harness. Then you can pull a
wagon all day long!
I do my trading northeast of here in
{{color id="0"}}Akkala{{color id="-1"}}, so come find me if you're nearby.{{pageBreak}}And hey, spend enough time on the road
