{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}To think that woman from earlier was with
the Yiga Clan. Just imagine what would
have happened if I'd gone with her!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that I know the truth, I won't be
deceived so easily again.

I'm reassured enough to keep
investigating the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}.
Thank you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Now, that is just far too big to be a
star...isn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'll get on with my investigation after
the rain clears up.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm, when the weather is this bad, I just
can't make out much, if anything!

What are you doing?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, sorry.


There's something glowing in the sky in
the southeast, and I'm determined to find
out what it is.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's obviously beyond the scope, or even
the reach, of a field survey. No, my eyes
probe the sky.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I have a duty to report anything about sky
islands to {{color id="0"}}our group in Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
off in Necluda to the east.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, sorry.


I'm a bit preoccupied trying to make out
something I saw glowing in the sky to
the southeast. But I can't see it now.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}It was glowing. I know it was. Maybe it'll come back
out once it gets dark...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Sorry again. Lost in thought. I have a duty
to report anything about sky islands to{{color id="0"}}
Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} in Necluda to the east.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Could it have possibly...been a bird?
No, impossible. Birds don't glow.

---
label: Talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It couldn't have been a bird, could it?
Of course not...birds don't glow.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You'd better find a place out of the
rain, and quick!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I saw {{color id="0"}}something glowing{{color id="-1"}} in the {{color id="0"}}sky to the
southeast{{color id="-1"}}, but when the sky got lighter,
I couldn't make it out anymore.
I'm worn out from straining to see it
all night, so I'm going to take a break
at the stable.
You look like you've been working too
hard. While I admire your dedication,
be sure to rest properly.

In my official capacity as a member of
the Zonai Survey Team, I must discover
exactly what it is!
