According to ancient texts, {{delay15}}the wearer
is protected from any and all injuries.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I tried to wear them myself, {{delay15}}but the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}These {{color id="0"}}nails {{color id="-1"}}come from the terrifying,
one-eyed giant Hinox—a beast it's best
not to get close to.
It must be said...{{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}monster fangs and nails{{color id="-1"}}
don't have much destructive power when
attached to weapons.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}But what do you think happens when

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_03"}}Why, I'll tell you!{{delay15}} Their sinister shape
increases the arrow's destructive power
quite tremendously!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Of course, I toiled tirelessly to build up my

specimens in such a way.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you attach a {{color id="0"}}Fire Keese eyeball{{color id="-1"}} to
an arrow and fire it... {{delay15}}BEHOLD!

The arrow flies in pursuit of whatever

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}White-Maned Lynel mace horn{{color id="-1"}}
comes from a particularly ferocious

It's said that if you attach it to the tip of
a weapon, {{delay8}}that weapon will be filled with
rock-smashing power.

---
label: Talk_96

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm told {{color id="0"}}Ice-Breath Lizalfos tails {{color id="-1"}}extend

But that's not all! {{delay15}}I understand they imbue
weapons with the power to freeze
enemies too.

label: Talk_97

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}These {{color id="0"}}Gleeok wings{{color id="-1"}} come from one of
those giant three-headed monsters that

If you affix them to a weapon or arrow,
they'll stabilize your stance and greatly
increase the weapon's range.

---
label: Talk_98
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}These {{color id="0"}}Gleeok thunder horns{{color id="-1"}} come from a
specimen that fires quite a lot of lightning,
even by three-headed-monster standards.
Of course, attaching it to a weapon fills
that weapon with the horn's stored-up
lightning power.
It's said common monsters don't stand
a chance against its destructive powers.
