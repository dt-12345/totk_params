{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, I don't think I've seen you around
here before. Good on you for saying hello.

Who are we? We're the first men who will
officially do business with the Gerudo—
the {{color id="0"}}Voe Caravan Squad{{color id="-1"}}!
If you, too, want to go to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}},
you would do well to make friends
with us!

label: talk0033

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't tell me, young man!


You want to join us—the first men who will
officially do business with the Gerudo—
in the {{color id="0"}}Voe Caravan Squad{{color id="-1"}}?
Well, too bad. United for years by our
love of Gerudo Town, our squad has
been together through thick and thin!
So when those gates finally open, it'll be
just the three of us striding together into
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}!

Voe Caravan Squad?

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're a group of merchants and friends
who have long dreamed of doing business
in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, and "voe" is the Gerudo word for
"man." Voe's the word to know!

If you don't understand at least one word
in their language, the Gerudo will never
accept you!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And we should know! We've spent years
here trying to curry favor with them any
way we could.
They've finally entrusted us with
protecting the {{color id="0"}}western entrance{{color id="-1"}} to
Kara Kara Bazaar!
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've lost count of the number of times I've been
swatted with the flat of a guard's spear...{{delay15}}
They mistake me for some lowly opportunist!{{size value="100"}}

Gerudo Town?

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Gerudo Town is located straight out of
this gate. It's a town made by Gerudo, for
Gerudo... Which means it's full of Gerudo!
And to us...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}{{size value="125"}}That means it's a utopia!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0030
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Captain! Not so loud! You're going to give the
Gerudo a bad impression of us!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}S-sorry, Robsten... {{delay15}}It just slipped out.

---
label: talk0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}*ahem* Anyway, the Gerudo have a {{color id="0"}}law
forbidding males{{color id="-1"}} from entering their town.

Keeping us shut out only makes us
all the more curious though! I mean,
that's just common sense!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We were hoping to raise the {{color id="0"}}Voe Caravan
Squad{{color id="-1"}}'s likability by gallantly rescuing the
Gerudo ladies from the sand shroud...
But the sand shroud doesn't just block
our vision, it confuses our compasses too.
We got lost in about five seconds.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In the end, it was the Gerudo ladies who
ended up gallantly rescuing us...

Still, maybe if we prove our muster as
gate guards, Gerudo Town will make an
exception and welcome us as heroes!

Goodbye.

label: talk0024

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's only a matter of time until we become
the first men invited into Gerudo Town,
I'm sure of it!

---
label: near0001
---
...Why?

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Young man! As the captain of the caravan
squad, allow me to thank you once again
for rescuing Ponthos!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}However...

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Just when we were getting on their good
side, we messed up our one job. They'll
never trust us with guard duty again!
For anyone else, this would spell disaster
for a plan to officially do business with
the Gerudo...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But the Voe Caravan Squad doesn't know
the meaning of "give up"!

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's right, captain! This is nothing
compared to the time those travelers
thought we were a band of criminals!
Or when we were captured and nearly
skewered by the guards!

Or when we finagled our way into
Gerudo Town and got thrown in {{color id="0"}}jail{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_01"}}V-very true, Robsten. Our spirit is
truly indomitable.

Though now that you've brought up all
those traumatic memories, I'm feeling a
bit more...domitable than I was earlier.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We were fired from guard duty for
whatever reason...

Which puts a damper on the Voe Caravan
Squad's plans to become the first men
officially accepted by the Gerudo.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But we don't have it in us to give up now!

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Now that the sand shroud cleared up,
I think we'll head to Gerudo Town to
negotiate with them directly!

---
label: talk0037

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Once this sand shroud clears up, I think
we'll head to Gerudo Town to negotiate
with them directly!
