{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Yes, yes, what is it?{{pageBreak}}Oh, it's you, Link. Haven't seen you in—{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}LINK! YOU'RE BACK?!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Ah— {{delay15}}My apologies for the outburst.
C-clearly, you're back in town, then.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But what of Princess Zelda?

---
label: Talk_4025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ah, Princess Zelda is still missing, which
is the reason you came here alone... That
makes more sense.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Princess Zelda built this {{color id="0"}}school{{color id="-1"}}, you see.{{pageBreak}}She cared so much about the children.
I'm sure this would be one of her first
stops if she had returned.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Right now, we're covering history, which
was very important to Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}We're focusing on Hyrule's history
alongside {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You know, Link, you're welcome to sit in
on a lesson if you'd like.

---
label: Talk_4026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}That said, class has ended for today. But I
hope to see you here tomorrow morning!

---
label: Talk_4023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Class is from morning until noon-ish,
so please stop by the {{color id="0"}}classroom on the
first floor{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_4001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yes, yes, what is it?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Ah! Eager for the next {{color id="0"}}history{{color id="-1"}} class to
begin, I take it?{{pageBreak}}The subject is {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}, which I'm not
surprised you have a keen interest in.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But you're a little early for class to start.
Would you mind waiting?

---
label: Talk_4002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Are you that excited to hear me lecture on
{{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}? {{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Well, I appreciate that, but it's a bit early
for class to begin. {{delay8}}Wait just a little longer,
if you can.

---
label: Near_4001
---
Hope I recall my lecture.

---
label: Talk_4009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}My, my, aren't we early. You're certainly
welcome to sit in on my {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The subject of today's lesson is Hyrule's
history alongside {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It'll begin shortly after I get settled.

---
label: Talk_4004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Today's lesson concerns Hyrule's history
alongside {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}To study history is to learn from those
who came before us.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}A thorough understanding of the past is
essential if our children hope to build
a better future.{{pageBreak}}You're welcome to sit in on the class and
observe, if you like!{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_4005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Just what road led to Hyrule becoming
the place that it is today?{{pageBreak}}I believe that in order for our children to
have a bright future, they must first learn
about {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I'd be pleased if you joined us for today's
lesson, Link.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_4010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wonder if a class on the Calamity might
have been too difficult for the children.{{pageBreak}}But to study history is to learn at the feet
of those who came before us.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}A thorough understanding of the past is
essential if our children hope to build
a better future!{{pageBreak}}I must be patient and teach them until
they've learned the lesson well.

---
label: Talk_4024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If you have the time for it, Link, why don't
you sit in on one of our lessons?{{pageBreak}}We start class promptly each morning
once all the children are settled in.

Teach the Calamity...

---
label: Talk_4015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}"History is a tale we all tell together. It
was begun by those who came before us,
and those who follow us will continue it."{{pageBreak}}So said Princess Zelda when asked why
she founded this school.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I want the children to make it in this
perilous world and build a bright future.{{pageBreak}}That's why I put so much effort into
teaching them about history...especially
about {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But teaching is learning, you know, so I
keep up my own studies every day to
make sure I'm up to the task.

---
label: Near_4006
---
I'm almost prepared...

---
label: Talk_4019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I plan to make {{color id="0"}}Hyrule's struggle with the
Calamity {{color id="-1"}}the focus of the class.{{pageBreak}}To study history is to learn from those
who came before us.{{pageBreak}}A thorough understanding of the past is
essential if our children hope to build
a better future.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I need to be patient and walk them
through whatever difficulties they might
be encountering.

label: Near_1000
---
A lesson on the Calamity...

---
label: Talk_1000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Today's class will be a history lesson.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The story of Hyrule is deeply intertwined
with the Calamity. {{delay8}}And that is no
exaggeration or embellishment.{{pageBreak}}The Calamity has been visited upon the
land of Hyrule several times before.{{pageBreak}}It was sealed away 10,000 years ago by
the sacred princess and a hero wielding
the sword that seals the darkness.

---
label: Talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Isn't that just a fairy tale?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Over time, history and legend sometimes
blur together.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}All this stuff about 10,000 years ago and
such...who cares?

label: Talk_1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}You got any pictures or proof to back up
this so-called {{color id="0"}}10,000-year-old Calamity{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1007

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}It's no fairy tale, I assure you. These are
real historical events!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}This is a problem... I'll need to show them some
kind of depiction of the Calamity from 10,000
years ago.{{pageBreak}}Otherwise this lesson is over before it began.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm sorry, Link. {{delay8}}This isn't how I thought
the lesson would go.{{pageBreak}}If I had more foresight, I'd have borrowed
the screen depicting the Calamity from
Lady Impa's Hall.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, where the hall is located,
is also in Necluda, but it's too far to the
{{color id="0"}}northwest {{color id="-1"}}for a casual visit.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If only I could show these children {{color id="0"}}a
detailed image {{color id="-1"}}of the screen depicting
the Calamity, I think they'd understand.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Although I suppose it isn't Lady Impa's Hall now,
is it? More accurate to call it Lady Paya's Hall.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Speaking of {{color id="0"}}detailed images{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Robbie{{color id="-1"}} mentioned he was making a tool
to make pictures out of scenery.{{pageBreak}}I wonder if he ever finished it.{{pageBreak}}Maybe I'll try asking him once he's back
from {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}.

There must be some way...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah, good evening to you. {{delay8}}You needn't
worry about me lying here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}The problem of figuring out how to explain

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wish that I could show the children a
{{color id="0"}}detailed image {{color id="-1"}}of the screen depicting
the Calamity found in Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}I think they'd understand in no time if
they had a visual aid like that.

Hm... Quite a conundrum.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah, Link. Good morning to you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}The problem of figuring out how to get my

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}How can I show the children something
that would help them understand?

Quite a conundrum...

---
label: Talk_2018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Ah, yes, so, our subject today is history
once again. {{delay8}}First, let's go over what we
learned the other day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The story of Hyrule is deeply intertwined
with the Calamity. {{delay8}}And that is no
exaggeration or embellishment.{{pageBreak}}The Calamity has been visited upon the

label: Talk_2019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Mr. Symin! Can you prove any of this?!

---
label: Talk_2020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Isn't it more likely that over time, history
and legend started to blur together?

---
label: Talk_2021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Are we still talking about stuff that
happened 10,000 years ago?

---
label: Talk_2022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Can you point to any paintings or images
that actually show there was a {{color id="0"}}Calamity
10,000 years ago{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_2016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can see I'll have to actually show the

to move my lesson plan forward...

---
label: Talk_2017

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}What should I do?{{pageBreak}}If I had more foresight, I'd have borrowed
the Screen of the Ancient Hero from

is also in Necluda, but it's too far to the

label: Talk_2040

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}What should I do?


---
label: Talk_2041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}A {{color id="0"}}picture {{color id="-1"}}of it would do the trick.
Anything to show the children what the
screen depicting the Calamity looks like.

---
label: Talk_2042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Without that, I don't see how I can move
forward with my lesson plan.

---
label: Talk_2039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}So, ah, for this class we'll be going over
the Calamity again. Let's start by
reviewing our last lesson.

I have a picture to show.

Hello, class.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ah, hello, Link.{{pageBreak}}If it's all right with you, I'd like your help
in researching {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Right now, my stumbling block is figuring
out how to help the children understand
the lesson I'm teaching.

---
label: Talk_2024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}There must be some way I can help the
children understand...

---
label: Talk_3010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What's this?! A screen depicting the
Calamity! {{delay8}}C-class, please take note here.{{pageBreak}}This is a rare opportunity to see a primary
source regarding the Calamity!

---
label: Talk_3008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Wow...this looks like the real thing.

---
label: Talk_3009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So the legend was true? That's amazing!

---
label: Talk_3011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You know...{{delay8}}seeing this makes it feel like
it might've happened yesterday.

---
label: Talk_3012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Well, if you got documented proof,
that's good enough for me!{{pageBreak}}Go on, Mr. Symin! Tell us the rest of the
story about the Calamity!

---
label: Talk_3013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Ah— Of course!

---
label: Talk_3020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Thank you so much, Link.{{pageBreak}}My lecture about {{color id="0"}}the Calamity{{color id="-1"}} might run
long, but I hope you'll stay for it anyway.

---
label: Talk_3021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}Tell us more! When did all this happen?

---
label: Talk_3025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}D-did something happen?

---
label: Talk_3026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Sadly, the sacred princess was unable to
awaken the holy power within her.

---
label: Talk_3040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The Divine Beasts were taken over by the
Calamity. Those selected to pilot them
lost their lives in the process.{{pageBreak}}Worse still, the hero wielding the sword
that seals the darkness was badly hurt.
Just when all seemed lost...{{pageBreak}}The sacred princess came into her power
and devoted her whole being to keeping
the Calamity at bay for 100 years.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Is everyone following along so far?

---
label: Talk_3041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}After spending 100 years dormant, the
hero wielding the sword that seals the
darkness awakened, his wounds healed.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}He won back the Divine Beasts with the
help of several allies, including some of
the Champions' descendants.{{pageBreak}}And in the end, the hero defeated the
Calamity, and the sacred princess stopped
the evil one!

---
label: Talk_3042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}Sorry, I got a little emotional there at the
end. {{delay8}}It's a true story though.

---
label: Talk_3029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}All that we have...our land, our lives,
our civilization... We owe it to all those

fretting over it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Today marks the last day of history class, 
but if you have any questions about the

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, that's right... {{delay8}}You should have
something for all your help. Would
this do?

---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}It doesn't seem that you have room
for anything else.{{pageBreak}}I love the Hylian rice grown in this village,
so I'd thought it might be nice to give
you some.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But it'll keep. Please do come and see me
again once you've made space for it.

I take it?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Oh...still overloaded as ever, I see.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Well, the Hylian rice will keep. But do
come see me again once you've made
space for your reward.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}With the new vegetables being developed,
they're harvesting less rice these days.
That's a shame, as it's a favorite of mine.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}You should taste it for yourself, Link!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Speaking of rice, our next subject is home
economics. {{delay8}}I planned to use the occasion to
talk up dishes that use Hylian rice...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_3038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Errr...but never mind that. {{delay8}}I have another
class later, and you're free to observe
that one, too, if you like.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And with that, I should get back to
the lesson.

---
label: Talk_3039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_01"}}Oh, pardon me. {{delay8}}I got wrapped up in my
own thoughts about class again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you have time for it, you're welcome to
observe the next lesson as well. I think it
would make the children happy.
