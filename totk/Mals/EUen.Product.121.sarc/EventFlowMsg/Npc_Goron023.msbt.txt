{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You see the buildings atop the cliff?{{delay8}}
That's {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}.

That's where the business desk is for
{{color id="0"}}Hudson Construction{{color id="-1"}}, where I work.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hudson Construction is a company that
handled assembly of Lookout Landing and
the Skyview Towers, to name a few.
President Hudson is always saying things
like "there's nothing I can't make!"

Anyhoo. If you're headed to {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}},
use the {{color id="0"}}railcar{{color id="-1"}}.

The railcar?

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's a suspended cart that'll take you from
this workshop to {{color id="0"}}Tarrey Town{{color id="-1"}}, like son
and done!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It's President Hudson's pride and joy!
It doesn't cost anything to use, so use
it whenever you like.

---
label: Talk_0027

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you wanna move or stop the railcar,
{{color id="0"}}just strike it{{color id="-1"}} directly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Lately folks have been into affixing
decorations to weapons and shields
and such.
Turns out most of them can't deconstruct
what they've done, so my brother Pelison
started a business to {{color id="0"}}do it for them{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}He gets it done—son and done! Give it
a shot sometime.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The rain makes everything slick, so you'd
better watch your footing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Careful of the lightning! You should
remove all your metal gear before you
get on.

label: Talk_0022

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's pretty dark, so watch your step when
you get on the railcar.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}I'll replace it with a new one, so come on
over to the construction site for a minute.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Thanks for waiting! These things don't
last forever, so make sure you don't ride
for too long, OK?

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Hey!{{delay15}} You can't take that!{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_9009

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}That doesn't belong to you. I'm gonna ask
you to return it.

label: Talk_9010

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}If you want the railcar to roll, you can get
in and strike it. Carrying it around won't
do ya much good.
