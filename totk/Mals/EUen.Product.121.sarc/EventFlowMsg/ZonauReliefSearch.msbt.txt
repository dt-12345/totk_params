{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This is an account of a party from

Well done, dear chamberlain, in leaving

how this story from the ancient past
persevered so long to reach us today.

---
label: talk_122

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This one looks to be about Queen Sonia.
It claims that Sonia was a priestess before
marrying Rauru.{{pageBreak}}Despite his status as a Zonai, a people
popularly thought to be gods, she would
counsel him without any trepidation.{{pageBreak}}Moreover, Rauru heeded this counsel.{{pageBreak}}This account gives us firsthand knowledge
of the nature of Queen Sonia and King
Rauru's relationship.{{pageBreak}}Rauru found himself unexpectedly
charmed by her strong will, and before
long, they were married...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Er, that last bit isn't in the text. That's me
speculating.{{pageBreak}}History rarely speaks of a person's
character prior to being elevated to
royalty. So I can't help but fantasize.

---
label: talk_123
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is a tale of King Rauru.{{pageBreak}}Apparently, he would vacate his official
business from time to time in order to go
out hunting.{{pageBreak}}I had the impression he was a stricter,
more serious king, but I guess he had a
lighter side as well.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}However, Queen Sonia was always a step
ahead. She would put a stop to King
Rauru's hunts and bring him back.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}We rarely get a glimpse into the down-to-
earth side of royalty in this way. {{delay15}}It's an
important find, to be sure.

---
label: talk_124
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The subject here is the actions King Rauru
and Queen Sonia undertook not long after
Hyrule's founding.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}With the kingdom established, they were
worried for their people, so they set out
to eradicate the monsters troubling them.{{pageBreak}}They created structures called Shrines of
Light to seal the monsters away so that
they could never be revived.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}There's more here about light...and time
too... {{delay15}}The sense I get is that the two of
them may have had supernatural powers.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Though it's part of ancient history, it's a
feat those of us living today should still be
grateful for. {{delay8}}Truly an important discovery.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Here, we learn a bit about Mineru.{{pageBreak}}It says that she neglected to eat or
sleep while making something called
a...construct?{{pageBreak}}It was part of her research into a means of
returning to life as a spirit possessing a
new body, should her original one die.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}To you or I, this sounds less like history
and more like some sort of ghost story.{{pageBreak}}But remember who we're dealing with.{{delay8}}

that made such things possible.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The revelation that Mineru was a fellow

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is another fascinating entry.{{pageBreak}}If my translation is correct, the Zelda
described here is Sonia's distant relative.{{pageBreak}}According to this, she arrived in Hyrule
unexpectedly from another kingdom.
It seems she was a beautiful princess.{{pageBreak}}Her strange clothing perplexed the people
of Hyrule, and many were suspicious of
her at first.{{pageBreak}}But this Zelda had such an undeniable air
of nobility that those who doubted she
was of royal birth were soon silenced.{{size value="125"}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Note how clearly this conveys the writer's
