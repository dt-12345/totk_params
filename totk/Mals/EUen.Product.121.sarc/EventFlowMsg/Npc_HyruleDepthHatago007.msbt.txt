There, there. Stay calm...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Heading out? If you have any business

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Be careful out there. That afternoon {{color id="0"}}heat{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}You've caught me on my break. I need a
moment to sit down.

label: Talk_14

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}It might be dark, but that's no bother
to a horse. They have sharp eyes.
Even at night.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? Oh, hm. I was just resting my eyes.
It's a mite late for traveling, isn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}What wretched rain... I need to make sure
the horses don't catch a chill.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Looks like {{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}} could strike at any
minute. The poor horses are terrified.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Truly I live in a wondrous time. Skeletal
horses are not mere stories...

And creatures I thought would never get
used to people can be tamed.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}When I think that there might be other
miracles I've yet to see, well... What a
time to be alive.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oho! Another wonderful horse.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm...{{delay8}} That white horse...{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The Hyrulean royal family once had a
beautiful pure-white horse.

I wonder if this darling is descended from
a royal horse.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I'll never tire of looking at this lovely,
snowy horse. So dignified. Just like
Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hm! Now that's quite the horse...{{delay8}} It's not
often you see such a splendid steed.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}N-no way...{{delay8}} Is that horse...{{delay8}}


{{size value="125"}}Epona?!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}


To be accompanied by such a
legendary horse...{{delay15}}

I thought this ever since you brought a
skeletal horse by. But this? You must be
extraordinary indeed.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}To think I'd see the legendary horse

traveler. A lot of joy, indeed.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ooh. This skeletal horse is remarkable.
Its appearance might be a little...unusual,
but it has the most adorable face.

label: Talk_24

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh my! Is that...{{delay8}}a golden horse?!


What a rare sight! It's said that only one
is born every 100 years.

I never thought that I'd be fortunate
enough to see one in my lifetime.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thank you, traveler. Meeting you has
made my days more lively.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm. The metallic sheen is beautiful.
I wonder what causes it.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Oho. What a sweet darling you have
there! Just be careful when you dismount.
I hear they can be feisty.
