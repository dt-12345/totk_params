Is that you?{{delay8}} So it is... Link!


{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_01"}}How did you find this place?!


King Dorephan is resting.


{{anim type="Shitauchi_00"}}He has nothing to say to you! I insist that
you leave this very instant!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}King Dorephan is resting.


Regardless, you cannot be trusted! I insist
that you leave this very instant!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_01"}}Gah! You have returned, have you?
What cruel ploy are you plotting?!

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="SickGreeting_00"}}Hold, my ever-loyal Muzu.


If you speak in such a way without
explanation, Link here will only be
confused as to what is going on.

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SickThink_00"}}Hello, Link. It has been some time since
we last spoke.

I had received word that you went missing
along with Princess Zelda. Why have you
come here?

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SickThink_01"}}Well, well... To think that such a thing
should transpire for the hero of Hyrule
and Princess Zelda...

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}You expect us to believe that Princess
Zelda simply disappeared, just like that.{{delay15}}
Do not sully our ears with your lies!
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}I saw Princess Zelda with my own eyes
right after the phenomenon at Hyrule
Castle took place!

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Calm yourself, Muzu.


Link's eyes betray no hint of deception.
He remains a trusted friend of the Zora.

There must be an explanation.

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Link. I will now tell you what happened
when we last saw Princess Zelda...

As well as the reason behind my seclusion
here in the Pristine Sanctum.{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_18

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}We encountered Princess Zelda just after
Hyrule Castle ascended into the sky.

Floating islands appeared as if from
nowhere...{{delay15}}sludge and fragments of
ruins began raining down...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Muzu and I had left the domain to
investigate these strange occurrences.
That is when it happened.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="SickGreeting_00"}}Princess Zelda descended from the sky
accompanied by a sludge monster.

What happened next took us by surprise...{{delay15}}
She then unleashed the beast upon us.

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}King Dorephan valiantly vanquished the
threat. However... {{delay15}}He was gravely injured
by the sludge during the battle...
As for Princess Zelda, she vanished
without a trace.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}If word got out that Princess Zelda lost
her mind and harmed the Zora king...{{delay15}} The
resulting turmoil would be devastating.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That is why we are temporarily remaining
hidden within the Pristine Sanctum.

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SickThink_00"}}According to your story, Princess Zelda
disappeared suddenly in the depths
beneath Hyrule Castle.
On the other hand, she suddenly
appeared near Zora's Domain and
unleashed a monster upon us.
The waters of truth have become murkier
still,{{delay15}} but from the Zora perspective,
one thing is clear.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It all leads back to the sky.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}This disaster,{{delay15}} the sludge, the monster,
and even Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It may well be that the answer to these
riddles can only be found skyward...

label: Dm_ZO_0006_12

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Sidon ordered {{color id="0"}}Jiahto{{color id="-1"}}, a historian well
acquainted with ruins, to investigate.

I wonder if any progress has been made...

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah! {{delay15}}So you have already spoken
with Jiahto!

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Tell me, Link.{{delay15}} Has any progress
been made?

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah! {{delay15}}So you have spoken with Jiahto!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You say that the {{color id="0"}}mark of the king{{color id="-1"}} was
mentioned on the stone slate that was
restored? Hm... Indeed, I do know of it.
The {{color id="0"}}mark of the king{{color id="-1"}} refers to a Zora
king's scale. One of my scales,
in other words.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I have heard it called by the name you
mentioned in an ancient ritual. However,
none remain who know how it was used...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If this particular scale of mine may prove
useful to you, by all means, take a few.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}There is no need for restraint! This is as
nothing to me. {{delay15}}If you run out, simply
return and acquire more.
{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Wah ha ha!

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SickThink_01"}}After all that has transpired, and after
much reflection, I have come to a
realization.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I must truly be getting on in years to have
allowed a mere monster to catch me
off guard.
Perhaps the time is nearing for me to pass
the title of king on to Sidon.

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}King Dorephan...

---
label: Dm_ZO_0006_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}In any case, that is a matter for another
day, after the chaos surrounding the
sludge has quieted.
Please inform Sidon about my situation
and about the king's scale.

{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Tell him there is no need to worry about
me. Tell him that he must go forth and
do what needs to be done.
