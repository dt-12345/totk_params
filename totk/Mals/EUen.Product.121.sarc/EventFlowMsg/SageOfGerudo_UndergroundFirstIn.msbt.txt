{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Everyone in town has been informed of
the special exception you've been given.

Some may still be shocked to see you, but
don't take it personally.

And, of course, feel free to make use of
the inn or any of the shops.

Though {{color id="0"}}Lady Riju{{color id="-1"}} is away—seeking a
means to defeat the {{color id="0"}}Gibdo{{color id="-1"}}—I am sure
she would welcome you as I have.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Did you have questions for me?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Lady Riju is training in the ruins north of
here. She traveled there despite the
challenges the sand shroud presents...
She's proven herself to be an excellent
leader... {{delay8}}An excellent chief.{{delay15}} Still, I think
I'll always worry about her safety.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Gibdos{{color id="-1"}} are strange monsters that
recently appeared, right around the same
time as the sand shroud.
The spears we wield have surprisingly
little effect on them. We've been trying to
figure out new ways to fight back...
