Why would she do this?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Hello there, partner! What's brought you
all the way out here?

I'd heard that visitors stopped coming
to this stable, so this place had to shut
down. But here you are!

---
label: talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The changes in temperature here aren't
nearly as extreme right now. Leave it to
you to know just when to come through.

---
label: talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The temperature is really scorching my
feathers. But just look at you, kid.
Cool, calm, and collected.

---
label: talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The severe chill around here is nothing to
sneeze at. But look at you, kid—strutting
around like it's just another day.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've come to this stable because my
sources were chirping about a problem
with the well here.
Actually...{{delay8}}they say {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} caused
this problem. She shut down this well
and {{color id="0"}}declared it off-limits{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But without its water, this stable couldn't
keep travelers, horses, or the workers
refreshed.
The well also provided a steady {{color id="0"}}supply of
mushrooms{{color id="-1"}} to folks here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So why'd the princess want everyone
to stay away from it? That's the big
question. What we're short on is answers.
The owner—who's stuck here—is just as
puzzled as anyone else.

And I can't weasel down the well to see
what she was so concerned about.
My wings are too wide.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ugh!{{delay15}} I wish there was some way we
could get more details. But seems like
the deadest of dead ends to me.

---
label: talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Why did the princess go and ban everyone
from using the well?

The owner here has no idea. He's just as
puzzled as anyone else.

I can't even go down that well to take
a look for myself. My wings just get
in the way.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wish there was some way we could get
more details.

---
label: talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I want to figure out why the princess
decided no one could use the well.

I'd go right in and scope it out if I could,
but my body won't fit. We need more
details for the story!

---
label: talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The sun's going down, so we'll have to
resume our work here tomorrow. Time
to hit the hay... Oh, that's right.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This stable's shut down. No more beds...

label: talk19

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's getting pretty late, so we'll have to
resume our work here tomorrow. Time
to hit the hay... Oh, that's right.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This stable's shut down. No more beds...

---
label: talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look at this—already the sleepy hours of
early morning! Maybe I'll just hit the hay
for a few quick winks... Oh, that's right.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This stable's shut down. No more beds...

label: talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}So, what'd you find in the well?

---
label: talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}What's that? When you broke through the
rocks blocking up a cave...monsters came
scrambling out?
Partner! That's bad—real bad. You can't
just flap away from here now. We've got
to do something about the {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}.
This stable has enough trouble as it is
without those creatures swarming around
at the bottom of the well.

---
label: talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}The newspaper's reputation is on the line
too. Imagine what people would think if
they learned we helped ruin this stable.
Before you flap off, we've got to do
something about those {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar"}}Partner! I heard monsters down there.
Are you OK?

---
label: talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar"}}Partner! Are you all right?

---
label: talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wh-{{delay8}}what happened with the monsters?

---
label: talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Whew... {{delay8}}What a pain in the tail feathers
this all turned out to be. But it all resolved
in the end.{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}And we finally had a breakthrough...

---
label: talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So, there were a lot of monsters behind
that pile of rocks...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't help thinking the princess knew
about that monster den.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}She must have had a barricade put up to
seal away those creatures and protect
everyone here.
Now, why the princess didn't say so...
That's a mystery. But maybe she wanted
to keep any panic from spreading.
Or maybe it was only a very temporary
measure. But then she disappeared.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Yep, a little speculation on my part...{{delay15}}but
that's gotta be the story here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What do you say? Holds up, right? Our
job is to follow the facts, and that's where
they take us.

---
label: talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We needed to make some educated
guesses with our story, more than we'd
normally do, but...
I'll stand by this piece. We know our
princess, after all. She had to have
everyone's safety in mind!
I'll get to writing all of this up for the
paper.{{delay15}} You take care of yourself.{{delay15}}
