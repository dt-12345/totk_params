Heading {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} to take out a monster
fort uncovered there. -Captain Flaxel,
Monster-Control Crew, Squad Three

That iron ball is in the way.

---
label: Talk_010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, if it isn't Link! I had a feeling we'd
meet again!

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}We're raring to go beat up the monsters
that set up that big ol' fort.

---
label: Talk1047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But the {{color id="0"}}iron ball{{color id="-1"}} at the entrance is in the
way, and we're not sure what to do.

We can't go charging up there without a
plan, or that ball is sure to take us out.

---
label: Talk_009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I just wish we could {{color id="0"}}get rid of the iron ball{{color id="-1"}}
somehow, then we'd really give those
monsters a beating.

---
label: Talk_014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Hey, c'mon... {{delay15}}Everyone's real stressed
out right now.{{delay15}} So don't go pestering
anyone, OK?

---
label: Talk_011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'd have us charge that fort right now if I
could. But first we've gotta do something
about that ball at the entrance.
If we could {{color id="0"}}get rid of it{{color id="-1"}}, nothing would
stop us from giving those monsters the
thrashing they deserve.

---
label: Near1004
---
Nothing can stop us.

---
label: Talk_015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}We're just about to go take out the 
monsters that set up that fort.

There's nothing stopping us now. Time to
hit 'em with all we've got!

---
label: Near1006
---
What can we do?!

---
label: Talk_008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi_00"}}I can't believe we have to just sit here
on the sidelines! There has to be a way
to get rid of that blasted {{color id="0"}}iron ball{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk1005
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Whoa! {{delay8}}The path is clear!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}This is it, everyone! {{delay8}}Charge!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk1053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We were on our way to beat up the
monsters that set up that big ol' fort.

But then we got here and found it
totally deserted.

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}We did it! {{delay8}}We won!{{delay15}} Come on, gather
round, everyone!

---
label: Talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Get up, you lot!{{delay8}} We won!{{delay15}} Come on,
gather round, everyone!

---
label: Talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Incredible!{{delay8}} I can't believe how tough you
are!{{delay15}} There wasn't even a lick of fighting
left for us to do!

---
label: Talk1025
---
{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Link!{{delay15}} I didn't expect you to come all
the way out here!

I know it's cold and all, but I've got to
give you a reward.{{delay8}} Can you spare
a minute?

---
label: Talk1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Wow, you amaze me yet again!{{delay15}} Seriously,{{delay8}}
you must be what they call a prodigy
or something.

---
label: Talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Wow, you amaze me yet again!{{delay15}} There we
were, no idea what to do...

Then you come swooping in and wipe
out every last monster all by yourself!

---
label: Talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Wow,{{delay8}} you just jumped in there and helped
us out without saying a word. Modest as
always, I see.

---
label: Talk1046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If you're good enough to be Princess
Zelda's personal knight, I guess this
kinda thing is a piece of cake for you.

---
label: Talk1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, here's your reward.

---
label: Talk1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I got word
from headquarters.{{pageBreak}}Apparently we're not the only monster-
control-crew squad you've helped out.{{pageBreak}}So HQ asked me to give you this thank-
you gift. Hope it adds a bit of excitement
to your journey.

---
label: Talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're gonna rest up a bit and get ready
for the next battle.

That {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}I tell ya, no matter how many monsters
we defeat,{{delay8}} it makes sure we get knocked
right back to square one.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Anyway, if we don't get some rest, those
monsters will defeat us for sure,{{delay8}} and all
our hard work won't mean a thing.
Push yourself too hard and you become
your own worst enemy, ya know?{{delay8}} Same
goes for you. Go easy on yourself, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}{{playSound id="110" otherArg="0x0000"}}May the Goddess Hylia keep you safe,
brave warrior.

---
label: Talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If it isn't Link! I had a feeling you'd come!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}As you can see, the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} has
brought back the monsters good as new.{{delay8}}
Or maybe I should say BAD as new.

---
label: Talk1048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi"}}Oh and it isn't just the monsters that have
come back—that {{color id="0"}}iron ball{{color id="-1"}} is back too.

---
label: Talk1029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}As usual, I'm in awe of that incredible
strength of yours.

---
label: Talk1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Here, take this as a reward for all
your help.

---
label: Talk1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}As long as the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} keeps coming
back, we'll have to keep fighting.

I just wish we were as powerful as you
are.{{delay8}} I know that's too much to hope for,{{delay8}}
but still, we've got to get stronger.
Of course, push yourself too hard and you
do more harm than good.{{delay15}} That goes for
you too. Go easy on yourself, OK?
