{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hoo hoo hoo!{{delay8}} It's Link!{{pageBreak}}Thank you for aiding Rito Village in our
struggle. With your help, that wretched
blizzard is finally lifted.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What's more, I hear you looked after
young Tulin every step of the way.{{pageBreak}}You have my thanks and my admiration,
for whatever an old bird's esteem is
worth.{{delay8}} Hoo hoo...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hoo hoo hoo! {{delay8}}Hello there, Link!{{delay15}} It's been
a while, hasn't it?

Teba told me all about what you did—{{delay15}}how
with your help, that wretched blizzard is
finally lifted.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What's more, I hear you looked after
young Tulin every step of the way.

You have my thanks and my admiration,
for whatever an old bird's admiration is
worth.{{delay8}} Hoo hoo...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As you've no doubt surmised, I retired
from my position as elder and entrusted
the village to Teba's leadership.
Now I spend my days here, at the Flight
Range, helping mold the next generation
of Rito warriors.

label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I regret to say that the blizzard ruined our
old training equipment.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}But rather than try to re-create the
original course,{{delay8}} I've taken this opportunity
to prepare a new one.

---
label: Talk10
---
In this course, individuals will train their
wits and agility by passing through a
series of {{color id="0"}}floating rings{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}My hope is that this will teach young
warriors to fly more confidently even in
unfriendly skies.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}That said, no one has actually attempted
the course, as I only just finished it.{{pageBreak}}Hopefully a brave volunteer comes along
soon to try it out...

---
label: Near02
---
Care to try it?

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hoo hoo! So you're stepping up? You
want to try my training course?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}What a surprise, hoo hoo! And an honor!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The rules are simple. You pass through as
many of the {{color id="0"}}floating rings {{color id="-1"}}as you can
{{color id="0"}}before time runs out{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
Oh, and don't stray too far, hm? You'll be
{{color id="0"}}disqualified {{color id="-1"}}if you leave the Flight Range.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Since this is your first attempt, I'll go easy
on you... {{delay8}}Let's say {{color id="0"}}15 rings {{color id="-1"}}is enough to
earn a passing grade.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Manage that and I'll give you a
fitting reward.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hoo hoo! Care to try my new
training course?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hoo hoo hoo! {{delay8}}Marvelous. {{delay8}}I'll show you
to the starting position.

---
label: 0002
---
What are the rules?

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You simply pass through as many of the
{{color id="0"}}floating rings {{color id="-1"}}as you can {{color id="0"}}before time
runs out{{color id="-1"}}.
And don't stray too far, hm? You'll be
disqualified if you leave the Flight Range
partway through.
To start, let's call {{color id="0"}}15 rings{{color id="-1"}} a passing
score. {{delay8}}Clear that many and I'll give you
a reward.

---
label: 0003
---
Maybe later.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I see. If you change your mind and want
to try the course, do let me know.

return your {{color id="0"}}20 rupee {{color id="-1"}}participation fee.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You simply pass through as many of the
{{color id="0"}}floating rings {{color id="-1"}}as you can {{color id="0"}}before time
runs out{{color id="-1"}}.
And don't stray too far, hm? You'll be
disqualified if you leave the Flight Range
partway through.{{pageBreak}}Score high enough and I'll give you
a reward.

Note that in the advanced course, the
{{color id="0"}}number {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}location {{color id="-1"}}of the rings is
different than in the beginner course.

---
label: Talk204
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Hoo hoo! Was advanced too difficult?
Perhaps you should spend some time
practicing on the beginner course.

---
label: Talk205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Not bad, but if I may... You do have some 
room for improvement. For a start, try to
memorize the locations of all the rings.

---
label: Talk206
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Now that was some fancy flying!
I look forward to seeing you try the
course again.

and you'll be able to clear all the rings.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I can't believe it!{{delay15}} You passed through all
of the rings.

What an incredible showing.{{delay15}} I'll record
what I saw today so that posterity will
know of the flying Hylian.

tremendous efforts.
