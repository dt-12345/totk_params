{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Partner, you're here! I should've known
you'd come to this stable too.

Anyone with a beak for sniffing out news
can tell this place has potential.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}A {{color id="0"}}god of horses{{color id="-1"}}? Suspicious events at the
{{color id="0"}}nearby laboratory{{color id="-1"}}?

We could ink a week's worth of issues
about the goings-on in this place alone.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But I have bad news, and the headline is
"No Leads on Princess at This Stable."{{delay8}}

No chirps. No warbles. Nothing. Pains
me to leave knowing how many articles
I could've hatched here.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}There's nothing to do but take wing and
head for another stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}As for you, partner... Why not go dry out
at the inn? You're looking pretty soaked.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As for you, partner... Why not rest at the
inn till daybreak? Don't want to be stuck
outside with the late-night monster crowd.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The day is young. Who knows? If I hurry,
maybe I'll have something ready for the
evening edition!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The night is young. Who knows? If I hurry,
maybe I'll have something ready before
we go to print!

Anyway, off I go...{{delay15}}
