{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hi there! It's been a while. How are you
enjoying being a blademaster?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's rare that the Yiga sees a new member
worthy of the title. I expect you to wear it
well and do Master Kohga proud!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As a blademaster, you are allowed entry
to the inner sanctum.{{pageBreak}}Feel free to take your time in there. I will
be here waiting for another blademaster
candidate to arrive.
I only hope whoever's next can live up
to your outstanding example.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You are now officially a blademaster.{{pageBreak}}Why not go visit the hideout to spread
the good news?{{pageBreak}}Remember, it's in Karusa Valley, north of
Gerudo Town.{{pageBreak}}For anyone else, I'd say that's quite a
journey, but given what you're capable
of, you'll be fine.
Besides, it's important that the Yiga Clan
knows we have a new blademaster to
look up to!
