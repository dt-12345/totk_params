{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hello, hello! I know you, traveler! We've
had a delightful development. Look!

I mean, listen! It's Eustus...{{delay8}}he and his
horn are back in our troupe!

---
label: Talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's heartbreaking to think of the poor
fellow getting stuck in a hole on the way
to Rito Village.
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Note to self—Eustus doesn't get to drive the
cart anymore.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But I'm glad he's out of his funk and fit
as a fiddle.

Eustus's horn will blow the Stable Trotters
back on course!

---
label: Talk0023

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oooh, if it isn't our biggest fan! Thanks to
you, Beetz and Pyper came back!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Please accept my humblest gratitude for
easing their worries.

Thank you, most musically!


The Stable Trotters can once again boast
Beetz's precise rhythm and Pyper's
airy melodies.

With Pyper up high and Eustus down low,
the Stable Trotters' signature sound is
back in range.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, oh! My warmest greetings! These

As though nature absorbs all sound...

---
label: Talk2301
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Do you feel it? The beat that energizes
you when you're moving around, pushing
your body to the limit?
Or has all that travel got you down?{{delay15}}
The first bar of music will blow that
exhaustion away!

---
label: Talk2304
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But we're not in our normal groove.
Our tempo is out of whack when we
{{color id="0"}}don't have the full group{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 0002
---
Where are the others?

---
label: Talk2201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I've got an idea about little {{color id="0"}}Pyper{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}He went {{color id="0"}}southeast to Faron{{color id="-1"}}, saying
something about music in the subtropics.

I get the feeling he might have been
kind of confused.

---
label: Talk2202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Huh. I can't remember, but {{color id="0"}}Pyper {{color id="-1"}}might
know something.

---
label: 0003
---
Hang in there.

---
label: Talk2200
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We'll get by. {{delay15}}We might not have the full
crew, but my beats will keep us going
when we're feeling down!

---
label: Talk2303
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}When Mastro gets going, he can conduct
people right out of their seats and get
'em dancing.
I want my flute music to make everyone
smile and dance too!

---
label: Talk2305
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I wish we could get the {{color id="0"}}whole group back
together{{color id="-1"}}. Then we could put on a really
fun show.

---
label: Talk2300
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Eustus said something about heading off
to {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Bridge Stable{{color id="-1"}} and then to
nearby Hebra in the northwest.
But I don't know if he's anywhere in
that whole area now.

---
label: Talk2306
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ugh, I can't remember.{{delay15}} {{color id="0"}}Eustus {{color id="-1"}}might
know something though.

---
label: Talk2302
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm still gonna give it my all, even if we
don't have everyone! Well, I might take
a nap first. But then I'll give it my all!

---
label: Talk2404
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}You've truly been there for us when we've
needed you, traveler. That's an idea that
I'd like to bring into my playing more.
My horn can also truly be there for the
rest of the troupe—and through our
music, for travelers who come to hear us.

---
label: Talk2405
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I fear that dream will not be
realized until our troupe can {{color id="0"}}perform
as a complete ensemble{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk2400
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Beetz said he was heading to {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}} in
the {{color id="0"}}southeast {{color id="-1"}}to look for something.

He appreciates anything new, so
maybe he went to see the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
in Kakariko Village.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I hope Beetz found whatever he was
looking for.

---
label: Talk2401
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I wish I knew something that could help
you.{{delay15}} Have you tried asking {{color id="0"}}Beetz{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm happy to keep working on my own
music so we can build toward the
