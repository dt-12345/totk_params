{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You ever tried busting open one of those
{{color id="0"}}splash fruits{{color id="-1"}}?

If you hit 'em or smash them against
something, water comes splashing out!

You can use them to put out fires or cool
yourself down on a hot day. If you ask me,
they're essential for travel.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Say... That pitch wasn't half bad! Perhaps
I have a future in fruit vending.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="0"}}Splash fruits {{color id="-1"}}are super useful. You should
always pick them up when you find them.{{pageBreak}}Then you'll have water whenever and
wherever you need it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm on this journey to find a partner, but
the real joy has been meeting all these
different people along the way!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Though I've met a lot fewer since more
monsters started showing up.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}But hey, did you hear about those strange
{{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}?

I bet they're drawing a huge crowd, and
you know what crowds are full of?

Potential suitors, kid. And maybe my voe!

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}With those strange {{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}}, there are likely to be lots of
people there now.
I wonder how many of them are
unattached...

label: RainPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey, kid! Wanted to shelter from the rain?
That makes two of us.

We might as well have a chat while we
wring ourselves dry, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The sound of rain reminds me of a voe
I once met.

He was coming out of a cave, and he
looked drenched. When I asked why,
he said, "It was pouring in there!"
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}It turns out some {{color id="0"}}caves have rain
falling inside{{color id="-1"}}! You believe that?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Here I thought caves were where you
went to get dry on rainy days, not to get
wet on clear ones.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}A long time ago I saw a voe coming out of
a cave, completely drenched.

I was amazed. {{delay8}}How had he gotten so
thoroughly soaked?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Come to think of it, I have heard rumors
of a {{color id="0"}}cave that had rain falling inside it{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh, hey, kid.{{delay8}} Keep your eyes peeled
around these parts, OK?

The {{color id="0"}}Lanayru Wetlands {{color id="-1"}}have been the
{{color id="0"}}monsters' turf {{color id="-1"}}for a long time, so there
are lots of creeps hanging around.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I heard some of them even set up camp
in the {{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}nearby.{{delay8}}

If you're going that way, you'd better be
ready for things to get ugly!

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Rumor has it that there are monsters
camped out in the {{color id="0"}}ruins {{color id="-1"}}nearby.{{delay8}}

Tread carefully around here, OK, kid?
You're in the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru Wetlands{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}This is
monster territory.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}We're just {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}} of {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}} right
now.{{delay8}} You, uh, have heard of it, right, kid?
The watery city where the {{color id="0"}}Zora{{color id="-1"}} live?
I've heard it's a gorgeous place. Beautiful,
sparkling stonework everywhere you look.
Definitely on my list of places to see.
I ran into a Hylian once who was on his
way there to see a Zora vai...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It just warmed my heart!{{delay15}} Isn't it wonderful
that people from such different cultural
backgrounds can become friends?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I hope he made it to her safely. {{delay8}}Sounds
like the road to {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}} has
crumbled and no one can get across.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You can reach {{color id="0"}}Zora's Domain{{color id="-1"}} by going
{{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} of here.

I hear the road's run-down though,
so if you do head that way, be ready
for a difficult journey.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't quote me on this, but I heard there
are strange ruins in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

And by "strange," I mean "{{color id="0"}}ring-shaped{{color id="-1"}}."
Who ever heard of such a thing?

I know that since the Upheaval, there's
been no shortage of strange sightings
and wacky discoveries.
But {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}}? Can you get more
bizarre than that?

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Rumor has it some strange {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped
ruins {{color id="-1"}}were excavated in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

Don't believe me? See for yourself!
The village is {{color id="0"}}southeast {{color id="-1"}}of here.

label: BackRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Whew... They told me this was monster
territory, but I didn't listen. Guess this is
what you call "learning the hard way."
Unless I want a date with death, I'd better
not go any farther.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You know, {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}isn't too far.
Maybe I'll head there instead.

That'll give me a chance to check out the
ring-shaped ruins everyone talks about.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}With all the monsters around, I really
shouldn't continue any farther.

I think instead I'll go to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
to see those {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins {{color id="-1"}}I've been
hearing so much about.
