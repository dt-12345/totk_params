{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hm?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Apologies for not noticing you. {{delay8}}I was
focused on processing {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Excuse me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}} is already slated for
processing.{{pageBreak}}It would pose difficulties for me if you
took it for yourself.

---
label: talk_sky0018

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are examples of processed
materials available on the nearby shelf.{{pageBreak}}I encourage you to examine them to see
if there are any you want.

Zonaite?

label: talk_sky0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Oh? {{delay8}}Are you unfamiliar with it?

label: talk_sky0015

This is the {{color id="0"}}zonaite{{color id="-1"}} I mentioned. {{delay8}}It is
a unique mineral that can be mined far
beneath the land below.

---
label: talk_sky0016

There are trace deposits of it on this
island as well. {{delay8}}But they are limited to
this cave.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Our society flourished by {{color id="0"}}processing {{color id="-1"}}this

Processing?

---
label: talk_sky0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Zonaite {{color id="-1"}}is {{color id="0"}}processed{{color id="-1"}} by smelting it in
a furnace. {{delay8}}It is thereby converted into
materials with useful properties.{{pageBreak}}A few such materials will be ready for
your review shortly. {{delay8}}Wait one moment.

---
label: talk_sky0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Thank you for your patience. {{delay8}}I will now
explain what sorts of materials the ore
can be processed into.

Zonai technology is typically powered by
{{color id="0"}}Zonai charges{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_sky0013
---
These occasionally solidify into a form
known as {{color id="0"}}crystallized charges{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_sky0014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Converting {{color id="0"}}zonaite {{color id="-1"}}into other useful
materials in this way is called {{color id="0"}}processing{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you.{{pageBreak}}I will process this zonaite into
