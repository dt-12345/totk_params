{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But you picked a bad time to visit.
Monsters have taken the village.
Almost everyone is evacuated.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The inn, the restaurant, and the

Basically, if a serene vacation is what
you're after, go somewhere else.{{pageBreak}}My friend is the only reason I'm still here.
He sprinted off to get a change of clothes
and hasn't come back.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Why he did that, I don't know. I told him
it wouldn't end well...
