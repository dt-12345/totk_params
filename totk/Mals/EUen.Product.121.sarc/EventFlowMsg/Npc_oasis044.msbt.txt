{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hey! You recently arrived, right?
Does that mean the sand shroud has
finally died down?

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh, hang on...{{delay8}} Now that I really look, I can
see all the sand covering your clothes...

What was I thinking? If the sand shroud
really was gone, I doubt everyone would
still be hanging around...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ugh, sorry. I asked you a question, and
then immediately went on my own little
journey there.
Ever since the sand shroud started,
I haven't been able to see my husband.
It's left me a little frazzled.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm surprised you were able to travel at
all in that storm. You must be exhausted.

You know, in times like these, it's really
important to keep your strength up.
And you can do that by eating right!
My husband gathers all our products, so
the flavor and quality are guaranteed!

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry my selection is what it is...


Because of this sand shroud, I can't get
word to my husband to let him know what
we need to restock...

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder if he has anything left...{{delay15}}


I want to let my husband know what
the store needs, but as long as this
sand shroud continues...

label: 0001

Buy from me!

---
label: 0002

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I know my stock is pretty limited, but...


Here's a tip! You can make an excellent
meal just by adding a mushroom to some
Hylian rice and rock salt!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're looking to do some cooking, you

Vasaaq!

label: talk0001

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}With the sand shroud finally dying down,

Now the store is fully stocked, so buy as

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}With the sand shroud finally dying down,

I thought I would be fully stocked for a
while, but it looks like I underestimated
your appetite for my wares, huh?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's fine! {{delay8}}It's an excuse to see my
husband again! Sarq!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When that sand shroud was at its worst,
I thought it might be the end—that I might
never see my husband again.
It reminded me that every day is
priceless, and I need to live them to
the fullest...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}That's {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them? I'll pay you
