{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh, Link. You came.


Look at the mural on this wall.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It is thought to have been painted by
ancestors of the Gerudo.

It appears that when they created it, they
were also using this shelter to hide.

Perhaps the Gerudo of the distant past
were also beset by some great disaster.

Anyway, the writing on the mural says...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}"Standing back-to-back with the throne,
witness red pillars across a vast sea.

"Unite the pillars in light to reveal the
lightning stone and open the way.

"You who can hear my voice, come to me.
I await you."

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}That mysterious voice that spoke to us...


Its words reminded me of this mural.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}This image must represent a location of
some kind, and the engraved words are a
riddle to discovering its location.
It's the only explanation that
makes sense.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Wait... You already solved the riddle and
have figured out where to go?

Well done, Link. In that case, let's head
over there right away!
