{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}You're that voe that was under the cherry
blossoms before, aren't you?

I can't believe we'd run into each other
again after our first meeting was in such
a romantic place...
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Could it be...{{delay15}} Are you the voe of my
dreams after all?!

...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}No, I can see it in your face.


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I don't hold that special place in
your heart.

---
label: Greeting_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? Wait... You're that voe that was
under the cherry blossoms before!

I don't know if you remember me...


But I could never forget a voe that I saw
in such a romantic place!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Is it possible that you're the voe I am
meant to be with?

...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Hm.{{delay15}} No, I can see it in your face. You
aren't interested in me at all, are you?

---
label: Greeting_01
---
That's OK. {{delay8}}I am too busy to be interested
in anyone who doesn't share the feeling.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm on a mission to visit all {{color id="0"}}eight{{color id="-1"}} of the
{{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom trees{{color id="-1"}} that exist in
the world.
That way, when I meet the voe of
my dreams...

We'll meet in a really nice place! It's
important to start things off on the right
foot, after all.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}And... I might just meet a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}} too, if
I'm really lucky.

---
label: Greeting_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Oh, it's you again. Well, nice to see you
and all that, but I'm only interested in
the voe of my dreams, OK?
Just making that clear. {{delay8}}Anyway, do you
need something?

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm trying to decide whether I should take
the road {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} and head toward
{{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}...
Or if I should make my way to {{color id="0"}}Tabantha
Bridge Stable{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Have you visited stables much? A lot of
travelers pass through them, so you're
bound to hear the latest news if you visit.
I know I can learn about {{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom
trees{{color id="-1"}} if I travel to stables. {{delay15}}I might even
meet the voe of my dreams, if I'm lucky!
But first...I have to decide which stable
to visit.

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Should I take the road north and head
for {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}...

Or should I make my way to {{color id="0"}}Tabantha
Bridge Stable{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know that stables are hubs for news
and information, right?

I'm going to visit one and find out all I can
about {{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom trees{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}I might even
meet the voe of my dreams, if I'm lucky!
But first...I have to decide which stable
to visit.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm thinking about how I'll meet the voe
of my dreams under the blooms of a
{{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}}...
Which means I don't have time for voe
who are not of my dreams, OK?

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm... Maybe I'll give an offering of fruit like that
voe did.

If the voe of my dreams came right as I was doing it,
he'd be impressed for sure!

Oh. What if a Satori came instead? I guess that
wouldn't be such a bad thing since I want to meet a
Satori too...
But if I had to choose, I'd pick the voe. No question.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That reminds me... Before, when you
{{color id="0"}}offered fruit{{color id="-1"}} at the {{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}}...

There was this strange feeling in the air.
Like the whole atmosphere of the place
changed, somehow.
For a moment, I thought a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}} had
actually come.

I do hope to one day meet a Satori, you
know. But more than that, I want to meet
the voe of my dreams...

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It never rains in the Gerudo region, where
I'm from, so the rain here is always a
strange experience.
Everything looks completely different
during a downpour, don't you think?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}That reminds me... Before, when you
{{color id="0"}}offered fruit{{color id="-1"}} at that {{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}}...

there was this strange feeling in the air.
Like the whole atmosphere of the place
changed, somehow.
Such an unusual sensation...

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Whenever it starts to rain, I'm reminded
of the time you {{color id="0"}}offered fruit{{color id="-1"}} at that
{{color id="0"}}cherry-blossom tree{{color id="-1"}}...
There was this strange feeling in the air.
Like the whole atmosphere of the place
changed, somehow.
Such an unusual sensation...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We Gerudo never see the rain where
we're from, so it always feels special
when it happens on the road.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Can't you see that I'm in a hurry? I need
to get to {{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}} as soon
as possible.
That's where a {{color id="0"}}map of the cherry-blossom
trees {{color id="-1"}}is located. I have to get there and
study it!
It is my destiny to meet the voe of my
dreams beneath a cherry-blossom tree,
after all.
But I can't make that happen unless I
know where the cherry-blossom trees are.
Does it all make sense now?
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh... No matter how many times I look at that map,
I just can't commit all the locations to memory.
I really should take notes...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

label: BackRange_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Thanks to the map at {{color id="0"}}Outskirt
Stable{{color id="-1"}}, I know {{color id="0"}}where to find the
cherry-blossom trees{{color id="-1"}}.
I think it's time I started searching for the
voe of my dreams in earnest!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Just imagining a destined meeting
between a voe and a vai, framed in
falling cherry blossoms...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Heheh, I get butterflies in my stomach
just thinking about it!

I'd better hurry while the locations of the
trees are still fresh in my mind.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I've heard rumors that a mysterious
creature called a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}} has been living
on a mountain near here for a long time.
I doubt it will show up if I'm storming
around and making a racket, so I'd better
move quietly...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It apparently has an affinity for {{color id="0"}}cherry
blossoms{{color id="-1"}}. I bet it would show up if I
offered fruit beneath the tree.
I'd really like to meet such a creature.


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And while I'd much rather meet the voe
of my dreams, seeing a Satori would be
amazing too.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There are rumors that suggest a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}}
might live on a mountain near here.

Since I've come all this way anyway,
I hope I'm able to catch a glimpse of it...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm keeping my expectations low though.
If it were easy to find, there wouldn't just
be rumors, after all.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It apparently has an affinity for {{color id="0"}}cherry

Brrr... {{delay15}}I'm still so cold.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh! You are quite the handsome voe,
aren't you?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}To meet in such a romantic place... {{delay8}}Could
you be the voe I was destined to fall in
love with?
No, no, I can tell just from the look on
your face.

You did not come here in search for your
one true love. {{delay15}}That's too bad.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Still, in a place as magical as this, I really
do believe I will finally meet the handsome
voe of my dreams.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But until then, let me tell you a rumor I
heard about cherry-blossom trees.

Apparently there is a strange creature
called a Satori that is sometimes seen
near such trees.
I've never seen it myself, but I really
want to...

I also heard that a Satori likes fruit.{{delay8}}
I guess I should have brought some
kind of fruit with me, huh?

---
label: Talk_13

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, you're that traveler from the other
day.{{delay15}} Did you come to see a cherry-
blossom tree?

label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh my, have you come to see the
cherry-blossom trees again?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Is there anything more relaxing than
watching cherry-blossom trees? It really
puts me at ease.
I haven't seen a Satori anywhere, but
these beautiful trees have made the trip
worth it all the same.

Satori?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've heard that a strange, fruit-loving
creature called a {{color id="0"}}Satori{{color id="-1"}} can be found near
cherry-blossom trees.
Apparently it is very rare to catch sight of
the creature though. {{delay15}}I wonder if I could
do anything to coax it out of hiding?

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That reminds me though.{{delay8}} I thought I
heard some kind of animal cry earlier.

Maybe it was just my imagination? I'm not
sure now...

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It feels really good to relax like this once
in a while though. That's for sure!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It might be a little bit chilly, but it still
feels really good to relax like this once
in a while.
