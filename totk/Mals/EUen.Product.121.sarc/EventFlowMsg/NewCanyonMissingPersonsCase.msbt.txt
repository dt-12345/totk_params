{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Nenea and I lost sight of three of our

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}They're experienced travelers. I'm sure
they'll be fine.

They probably stopped to rest in a cave or
under some shade along the road, since
the canyon gets so hot during the day.
Not to say they'll travel faster at night.
It gets so cold, they might have to start
a fire to keep from freezing...{{pageBreak}}But they'll be back in due time. We just
have to be patient.
