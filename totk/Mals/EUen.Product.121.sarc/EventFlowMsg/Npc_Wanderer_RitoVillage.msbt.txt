A geoglyph here too...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh, Link. We meet again.


Cado and I came here to see a geoglyph.
Sadly, we were thwarted by the blizzard
and grounded nearby.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}After it finally calmed down, we made our
way to this village.

We plan to get on with finding that
geoglyph shortly.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The ancient literature indicates the
{{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple {{color id="-1"}}is here in Hebra—at
the bottom of the canyon.
We believe the temple holds the key to
unlocking the mystery of the geoglyphs.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}But even if we find the temple, our work
will not be done. There may be geoglyphs
located all over the world.
We must brace for a long, arduous search.
