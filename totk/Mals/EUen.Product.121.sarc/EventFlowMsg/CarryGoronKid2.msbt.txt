What should I do...

---
label: Talk12

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ugh... I'll never get to {{color id="0"}}Gorondia {{color id="-1"}}like this...{{size value="100"}}

Did you find Gorondia?

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, hey, it's you!{{delay8}} Uh...{{delay8}} {{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}?
Gorondia who?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Never heard of 'em! Never heard that
{{color id="0"}}Gorondia {{color id="-1"}}is actually a place where Gorons
used to live.
Definitely never heard that, and not
looking for it either!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}No way would I be looking for a place that
has weird vehicles and exciting treasures.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}And I most certainly didn't find {{color id="0"}}mine-
cart tracks {{color id="-1"}}that probably lead to this
legendary place I know nothing about.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}And the tracks definitely don't have
something wrong with them that's keeping
me from looking for the place. Nope!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}... The legendary place where Gorons of
old once lived...

Everyone says it's only a legend, but I know it's
gotta be real!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I mean, the place supposedly has weird vehicles and
technology better than ours.

Somewhere that exciting probably has treasure too.
{{delay8}}I'm gonna find it and then not tell anyone.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But the tracks are all blocked up, and I'm sure they
lead to {{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}} Huh?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Agh! You again?{{delay8}} Why would you just
stand there all quiet like that!

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Please don't sneak up on me.{{delay8}} For a
second, I thought my big secret was out.

I'm gonna check out the {{color id="0"}}mine-cart tracks{{color id="-1"}}.


Don't follow me!

---
label: Talk32

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Gorondia {{color id="-1"}}has gotta be down these tracks.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk23
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But with all these big {{color id="0"}}rocks having fallen {{color id="-1"}}on the
tracks, I don't know what to do...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk41
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And the cart won't move.{{delay8}} Ugh.{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk26

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}All {{color id="0"}}those rocks {{color id="-1"}}on the tracks are really...{{delay8}} Hang on...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Where'd they go?{{delay15}} They're gone!


{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Did they move on their own somehow?{{delay8}}
Whatever! I can use the tracks now!

Just gotta get this {{color id="0"}}mine cart {{color id="-1"}}moving!{{delay15}}{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But...how do I make the cart move?

---
label: 0003
---
The cart is ready.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} When did that happen?{{pageBreak}}How did you know I wanted to use it?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wait a sec. This happened last time I saw
you too.{{delay8}} You've got superpowers, don't
you? That's the only way!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well, whatever. It's fixed now, so I can
keep going!{{delay8}} Bye!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?{{delay8}} Something wrong?{{delay8}} Guess I'll get
out, then...

---
label: Talk08
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'll never make it to {{color id="0"}}Gorondia {{color id="-1"}}at this rate...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The cart's ready?{{delay8}} Then so am I!

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I want to go to {{color id="0"}}that side {{color id="-1"}}of the mine-
cart tracks.

{{size value="80"}}Gorondia has gotta be over there. I can feel it.{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk28

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry"}}Hey, guy.


Everyone knows that a cart won't move
unless it's on some tracks.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Can you please put it on the tracks before
I get on board?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}My cart is the one with the {{color id="0"}}cushion {{color id="-1"}}on it.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I don't want any bruises on my tush, so
make sure you've got the right one.

reward, huh?

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I wanted to give ya something, but your
pouch is full, so I can't.

I wanna give you a large Zonai charge, so
you should make space for it, and then
come back here.

label: Talk16

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Guy.


If you want this large Zonai charge, make
some room in your pouch, and come back.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You finally made space, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}A super-awesome place just for me!
Loaded with treasure! And I'm the only

before making it to Gorondia.
