{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}I'm picturing these three target dummies
as a swarm of Gibdos.

If we want to hit all three of them with one
strike, you should aim for the space
between them—like where that rock is!
I could also quickly hit each one
individually. That would work too.

Regardless, the farther my target is from
me, the longer it takes to build up the
energy to strike them. {{delay8}}Keep that in mind.
