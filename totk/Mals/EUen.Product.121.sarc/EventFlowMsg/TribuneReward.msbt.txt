{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, that's right.{{delay8}} This was your first job,
wasn't it?

Partner, you did quite well to get such
results your first time out! {{delay8}}Why, I'm
feeling a little proud myself!
Here's the start to the old nest egg!

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_01"}}As you take on more stories, your base
pay will obviously increase. {{delay8}}And there are
bonuses, of course!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Keep up the good work.

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}We've worked together to chase {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="ClearCount_Tribune" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}of the
stories relating to Princess Zelda.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}I didn't think making progress would go
so smoothly, you know... {{delay8}}I guess it helps
to have a dedicated partner.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You know, I don't think anyone would
take you for a rookie with how hard you're
working these investigations.
I'm sure Traysi appreciates your efforts!

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You know, we've now chased {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="ClearCount_Tribune" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of the
leads that might have had something to
do with Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Your investigations are the talk of the
office at the Lucky Clover Gazette.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You've really shown some promise!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}And it turns out the paper is doing
really well thanks to the articles we
keep putting together.
Which is why...Traysi told me we're both
getting raises!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Just as expected, partner!{{delay8}} Traysi made
the right call bringing you on.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_01"}}There's never time for a break, you know?{{delay8}}
I'd better make sure Traysi hears the
details of what happened here.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You've really gotten the hang of things.{{delay8}}
You could probably get a full-time job at
the paper if you wanted to.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Getting to the bottom of a mystery will no
doubt improve your reputation. Traysi will
be happy to hear about your efforts.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Go on and add this to your nest
egg, partner.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Oh, there's also this... It's from Traysi.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}So {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village's dye shop {{color id="-1"}}in Necluda
has started up a new service.{{delay8}} It has
something to do with fabrics.
I know, I know. {{delay8}}I'm basically giving you
an extra job by handing over this fabric,
but still...
The point is that, by accepting and making
use of it, you can show that you're
officially part of the Lucky Clover Gazette!
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It would be nice if Traysi handled things a bit more
simply though...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Anyway, that's all done. It's always great
working with you, partner!

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And just one other thing.{{delay8}} Traysi sent
along a {{color id="0"}}bonus{{color id="-1"}} for all our hard work!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's pretty rare gear that'll make it easier
to {{color id="0"}}keep your grip on walls{{color id="-1"}}, even on
rainy days!
It's not a pair of wings, but I'm sure it'll
still help you reach new heights, partner.

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}One other thing.{{delay8}} We got our {{color id="0"}}bonus{{color id="-1"}}
from Traysi!

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Any good reporter dresses for the story
they're reporting on, you know!

This gear lets you cling to walls without
slipping, even on rainy days.

It'd be pretty cool to wear this while
conducting an interview in the rain,
don't you think?

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hm, it looks like your pouch is pretty full
right now. {{delay8}}I've been holding this {{color id="0"}}armor{{color id="-1"}} for
you too...
Unfortunately, I can't wait here for you to
make room...{{delay15}} What can we do?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah! {{delay8}}OK. {{delay15}}If you can make room in your
pouch, you can go and collect the armor
from {{color id="0"}}Traysi{{color id="-1"}} at the newspaper office!

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, whoops! I almost forgot, partner!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Traysi has been really impressed with you,
and asked me to give you a bonus!

Here ya go!

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oh, that's right. {{delay8}}Traysi has had nothing
but nice things to say about you, partner!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Seems like there's a little extra something
in your compensation this time around.{{delay8}}
No surprise there!

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The newspaper has been doing really well
lately, and Traysi has sent us a little
bonus as a result!
It's nice to see that she values our hard
work so much. {{delay8}}Go on, take it!

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Traysi gave us another bonus—it sounds
like that article on Princess Zelda was
a hit!
Traysi was really excited about it.


Anyway, here's the bonus.{{delay15}} The job itself is
rewarding, of course, but these are nice
too. Don't you agree, partner?

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can't hear the chirps and warbles of my
little birds anymore.{{delay15}} It seems like this
was the final rumor about Princess Zelda.
I'm gonna report this to Traysi.{{delay8}} That
means that this is probably the last
addition to your nest egg, partner.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I don't think there's a reporter anywhere
else in Hyrule who makes the kind of
money we're making...
It really goes to show you how much
Traysi... I mean, how much the newspaper
values you.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If I'm being honest, though, {{delay8}}I have a
feeling our days of swooping in on scoops
are at an end.
{{size value="80"}}*sniff* {{delay15}}Ah...some water must have gotten caught
under my goggles...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It really was a blast, partner!

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}All that's left is to head back to the
Lucky Clover Gazette and let Traysi
know that the job's finished.
