{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You know, you're giving off kind of a
swordsman vibe...

Oh, because you are one. {{delay8}}I see.

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}WHOA!{{delay8}} A real live swordsman!{{size value="100"}}{{delay8}}


Urk!


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Sorry!{{delay8}} I said that too loud!{{size value="100"}}


Oh, I mean, uh... {{delay8}}I'm sorry. I got a little
too excited there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Um, {{delay8}}my name is Kenyo!


I want to be a swordsman someday,
so I'm doing all this work to bulk up!
Nice to meet ya!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I'm gonna be so buff someday that I won't
even need a {{color id="0"}}towing harness{{color id="-1"}} to carry
lumber and stuff!

Wait, towing harness?

---
label: Talk07_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You didn't know about towing harnesses?{{delay15}}
You're gonna love 'em!{{delay8}} I'll tell you all you
need to know.

---
label: Talk07
---
So, one of the exclusive perks for
{{color id="0"}}stable members{{color id="-1"}} is a towing harness
for their horses!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I guess you're a {{color id="0"}}stable member {{color id="-1"}}already,
so you've probably heard this all before.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But if you keep using stables and building
up your {{color id="0"}}Pony Points{{color id="-1"}}, you'll have that
harness before you know it!

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}If you sign up to be a {{color id="0"}}stable member {{color id="-1"}}at
the counter, I bet you'll be towing stuff
around in no time!

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Wait a sec,{{delay8}} your horse already has a
towing harness on it!

---
label: Talk26_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh? Wait a minute...{{delay15}} You already have a
towing harness!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Towing harnesses are great. Once you've
got one, you can have your horse tow a
wagon or even building materials!

---
label: Talk27_01
---
If there's {{color id="0"}}something you want to move{{color id="-1"}},
you should try to earn one quick!

---
label: Talk27_02
---
If there's {{color id="0"}}something you want to move{{color id="-1"}},
you should put the towing harness on
your horse.
Go to the counter and ask to {{color id="0"}}change your
horse's gear{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}My dad will get the harness
onto your horse for ya!

---
label: Talk27_03
---
You've got your towing harness on your
horse already.{{pageBreak}}If there's {{color id="0"}}something you wanna move{{color id="-1"}},
just attach it to the harness!

---
label: 0003
---
See ya!

---
label: Talk30
---
If you ever need to build something, you
can take anything you want from a
building-material storage area.
You'll find 'em along the road, but just
about every stable has one too!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I wanna be a swordsman like you, and
now's the perfect time to train!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Everybody knows that kids who sleep
well grow up strong.{{pageBreak}}If you wanna get buff enough to carry
lumber without a {{color id="0"}}towing harness{{color id="-1"}}, you
should get plenty of sleep too!

---
label: Talk32

{{anim type="Sleep_01"}}Horse god Malanya... {{delay15}}Is that...{{delay15}}true?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Sleep_00"}}Hehe...{{delay15}} I heard somethin' good...{{delay15}} Zzz...
