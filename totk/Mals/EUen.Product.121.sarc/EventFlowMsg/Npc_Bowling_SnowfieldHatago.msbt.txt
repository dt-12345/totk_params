{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm talking about the {{color id="0"}}blizzard {{color id="-1"}}outside.{{pageBreak}}This vicious storm began when so many
other terrible things started, and it hasn't
stopped yet.
It's impossible to walk around in this
kind of {{color id="0"}}blizzard{{color id="-1"}}, so I've been forced to
stay here at the stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But the {{color id="0"}}village where the Rito live{{color id="-1"}}—off
to the west of here—is in an even
worse situation.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}In this extreme cold and in this
blizzard, they can't get enough
food to feed themselves.
The villagers there are desperate to
figure out what's gone wrong with the
weather and how to feed everyone.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The vicious {{color id="0"}}blizzard{{color id="-1"}} outside started when
so many other awful things began going
wrong. Maybe it will never stop.
But the {{color id="0"}}village where the Rito live{{color id="-1"}}—to the
west of here—is in a dire situation.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}They can't get enough food in this
extreme cold. There's less and less
for them to eat.
