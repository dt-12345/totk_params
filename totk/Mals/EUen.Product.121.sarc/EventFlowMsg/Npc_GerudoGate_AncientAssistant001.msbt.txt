Now where is it?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, good morning!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, how are you?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ah, good evening.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Welcome, welcome. Thanks for stopping
by in this weather.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm investigating these ruins again today.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's hard to believe something this big was
up in the sky in the first place...

Then again, I heard that some huge ruins
fell into Kakariko Village as well, so there
is probably a lot more to this story...
A bunch of researchers have been sent
to those ruins, so I imagine they've made
some kind of discovery by now!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're interested in the ruins, you
should head to Kakariko Village.

---
label: Shiny_Day_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It would be a tragedy if ruins of this size
were left uninvestigated!

We've got to really put in some effort.
We can't have the researchers in Kakariko
Village outdoing us.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I won't let the temperatures in Gerudo
Canyon get in the way of my work!

---
label: Rain_Day_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We don't investigate the ruins when it's
raining, so I fill my time on days like this
double-checking all the supplies.
I like to know what I've got on hand,
just in case I get into a bad situation.
It pays to be prepared!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're planning to head through Gerudo
Canyon, make sure you've prepared
yourself and have everything you'll need.

---
label: Rain_Day_01_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}While I was double-checking the supplies,
I realized that I've got a bit more than I
need of something.
Here, I'll share this with you.

label: Rain_Day_01_01

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's exciting to run investigations and
make discoveries, whether we're talking
mysterious ruins or just our supplies!

---
label: Rain_Day_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Ahhh... The sound of the rain falling is
just so soothing, don't you think?

Gerudo Canyon stays nice and cool when
it rains...

---
label: Rain_Day_02_Thunder
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Every single lightning strike startles me!
I completely lose track of what I'm doing
until I recover.
Apparently there's no lightning in
Gerudo Canyon though...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Maybe I should go there.

---
label: Shiny_Evening_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Since I've finished up my work for the
day, I'm taking a bit of a breather
right now.
{{anim type="Ease_01"}}There's always more to investigate,
so it's important to grab some rest
when you can!
Let's do our best tomorrow!

---
label: Shiny_Evening_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That reminds me... I wonder what Quince
and the others are up to right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}Zzz... Zzz...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Today is gonna be a good day, I can feel
it! You can walk with me to the work site,
if you want.

---
label: Moving_Evening
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Today was a really productive day. You're
welcome to walk with me if you like.

label: Moving_Rain

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm, looks like it's starting to rain.
We should probably find some cover.
