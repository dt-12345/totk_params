What a bother...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sorry.{{delay15}} Everything around here is a bit of
a mess.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?!{{delay15}} We met at another Skyview Tower,
didn't we?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I dashed here as fast as I could,{{delay8}} and it
looks like you're pretty fast too!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Did you come to see the Skyview Tower?
{{delay15}}I hate to say it, {{delay8}}but things are a bit of a
mess right now.

A mess?

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Bye!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}A {{color id="0"}}big chunk of old ruins fell from the sky{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}}
and hit the Skyview Tower!

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}It knocked off the lid that covers the
hole at the top of the tower.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}That means the {{color id="0"}}hole at the top is open{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
And that's not all! {{delay8}}After the impact, the
door got stuck too.

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Let's see...{{delay15}} Maybe if you used the
terminal inside,{{delay8}} that would force the
door back open.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But without a way to get inside, we're
kind of stuck.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}The door is broken{{delay8}} and won't open...

---
label: Talk_22

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}{{size value="125"}}Huh?!{{size value="100"}}{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}How did you get in there?{{delay8}} I was pretty
sure you couldn't get that door open
without using the terminal...

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oooh!{{delay15}} I was right!{{delay8}} Using the terminal
did open the door.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Thank you! That was a big help.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now then...{{delay15}}I think I'll take a little break
before heading to my next job.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Thank you!{{delay8}} That really helped me out.{{delay15}}
Now, I think I'll squeeze in a break, just
for a while.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Phew! I finally can take a breather!{{delay15}}
The construction company's short on
staff, which is a pain.

That must be rough.

---
label: 0006
---
I'm in a hurry, so...

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Well, OK...

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That's right.{{delay8}} It's definitely rough.{{delay15}} Can I
tell you about it?

If it's not a long story.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I recently took a job as a carpenter for a
company called Hudson Construction.{{delay8}}

At first, things were great. Everyone was
really nice, {{delay8}}and my boss taught me the
basics and everything.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But the day Hyrule Castle floated up,{{delay8}} all
sorts of things changed.

Work started rolling in. It was endless!{{delay8}}
We've been busy ever since.{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}They sent us new carpenters to check
the Skyview Towers in each region. But
there are only THREE of us doing that.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}This work is going to keep us out
in the field—away from our company—for
a LONG time...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}{{size value="80"}}I mean, {{delay8}}good to keep the towers running.{{delay15}} That's
something at least.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Ugh.{{delay8}} Look at me. Got away from
myself there.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That's not like me at all.{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}Hey, mister. {{delay8}}I guess it was a whole,
long thing in the end.{{delay8}} Sorry.{{delay8}} Thanks
for hearing me out.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I hope I can get back to the construction
company soon.{{delay15}} I miss everyone.

label: Talk_29

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}A lot of ruins have fallen around this area.{{delay8}}
Really dangerous.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Always a good idea to keep your eye on
the sky here, just in case {{color id="0"}}ruins plop {{color id="-1"}}right
down around you.
