Lizard Lakes...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Have you talked to Yunobo recently?{{delay8}}


I was surprised to hear "{{color id="0"}}Lizard Lakes{{color id="-1"}}"
comin' outta his craw. Don't much hear
about them lakes these days.
I still recall an old nursery rhyme
about 'em.

"One brother hunts what the other
brother hides—two lizards fighting
over what's inside."
Not everyone knows this, but the {{color id="0"}}Lizard
Lakes {{color id="-1"}}are also called the {{color id="0"}}Lizard Brothers{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I searched high and low for them back in
my younger years. Always thought
{{color id="0"}}treasure {{color id="-1"}}must be{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}there somewhere.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Then on my hunt, Death Mountain blew
its top. It was covered in lava before you
could say boom.
Boy, I'd forgotten all about my search for
the lakes...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That's it. Talkin' about this has me all
worked up. It's been a real long time,
but I'm ready to start the hunt again!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Best place to start lookin' is {{color id="0"}}halfway up
Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}. My hunch way back
when led me to the {{color id="0"}}north side{{color id="-1"}}.
There's a YunoboCo dig site there
too, so we can hop in a mine cart and
get crackin'.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You tellin' me you're gonna go lookin'? If
you're serious, you'll want to head about
{{color id="0"}}halfway up Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I'm pretty sure it was the {{color id="0"}}north side{{color id="-1"}}...

Is that what you're decked out in?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}What a red-hot piece of treasure!

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Since the lava cooled, I always wondered
if someone might find 'em.

Not only did you do it, you found treasure
to boot!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}You're Yunobo's partner, all right!


Wish I could go back in time and tell my
spry younger self that the Lizard Brothers
really do exist!
I feel a real sense of fulfillment hearing
this. {{delay8}}Thanks for sharing the good news.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}The Lizard Lakes don't seem like a
dangerous place.

Maybe I misunderstood when I was told
not to go near them.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Even if I can't do much, I'll search this
area some more to get us answers about
Princess Zelda.
