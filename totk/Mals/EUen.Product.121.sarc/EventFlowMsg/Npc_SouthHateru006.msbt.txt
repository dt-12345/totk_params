{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Things have changed around here lately,
haven't they? Even the towns
are different.
There's been a lot of changes around
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}
in particular.

---
label: Talk_1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Do we protect the old or embrace
the new?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} seem
like they're at a major turning point.

Kakariko Village?

---
label: Talk_1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you're that interested, then you should
take a look!

---
label: Talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Kakariko Village is a Sheikah village
to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}.

It used to be a quiet town. That all
changed when {{color id="0"}}strange, ring-shaped
Zonai ruins{{color id="-1"}} fell from the sky.
Now it's crowded with both researchers
and tourists.

---
label: Talk_1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And that's not the half of it! Apparently
that ruin crumbled, and there was some
sort of big discovery.

---

---
Hateno Village?

---
label: Talk_1050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hateno Village is at the edge of Hyrule,
far to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.

It used to be known primarily for its {{color id="0"}}milk{{color id="-1"}}
and its {{color id="0"}}local produce{{color id="-1"}}.

Then, out of nowhere, a woman from the
clothes shop became a famous designer.

Now the town has become a {{color id="0"}}center
for fashion{{color id="-1"}}, of all things.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}If you're looking to do something special,
I recommend visiting Dueling Peaks'
stone statues.
There's no road up to the summit, so it's
no easy trek...

But the view of Hyrule at the top is a
true wonder.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}If you're up for a hard climb, I recommend
visiting Dueling Peaks' stone statues.

The view of Hyrule from up there is
something special!

label: Talk_1062

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That said, I would wait until it stops
raining. The mountain will be too slippery
to climb safely.
Please feel free to relax at our inn until
the weather calms down.
