{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Guess_00"}}I never imagined this was all deep
beneath Hyrule Castle...

---
label: talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When I was a child, I asked my father if
there was anything below the castle.

He told me there was, though seeing
it for ourselves or even discussing the
matter was forbidden.
No one in our family knew anything more
than that.

---
label: talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Description_03"}}I can recall what my father said, even
now. "No one must ever venture beneath
the castle—not even one of us."
He said this warning had been passed
down through my family for as long as
anyone could remember.

---
label: talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}We need to continue to explore this
underground area, forbidden or not.

The source of the gloom is down
here somewhere.

---
label: talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_00"}}I am determined to discover the
connection between this place and
the emergence of the gloom.

---
label: talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let's keep on going. We're sure to find
some clues to all of this ahead.

---
label: talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Guess_00"}}The ruins we're seeing down here...


I'm certain this all must be from the
Zonai civilization.

---
label: talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_02"}}I would have never dreamed we'd find
traces of the Zonai down here in this
forgotten place.

---
label: talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Description_03"}}Zonai... The very word has an air
of mystery.

The Zonai civilization comes up again and
again in history books, but none really
tells us much about who they were.

---
label: talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Beware_02"}}One thing historians have been sure
about is that the Zonai existed during a
time of great significance...
When Hyrule itself was founded.

---
label: talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_00"}}Given that Zonai ruins are right here,
under the castle... Hm...

It's strong evidence that the books are
correct—the Zonai and Hyrule shared
some sort of history together.

---
label: talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Guess"}}I wonder what more we'll discover as we
go farther.

---
label: talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Surprise_03"}}I can't tell you how excited I am.


The murals down here—their images
support so much of what historians
have written about.

---
label: talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_01"}}I find myself wondering...how did this
area come to be so forgotten? Why was
our history left hidden here?
Did the royal family in those ancient
times want this place and these murals
to remain secret and out of sight?

---
label: talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Guess_00"}}I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing
something here.

Why would anyone want to keep this
whole area a secret? It can't be because
of what's shown in those murals...

---
label: talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_00"}}I can only hope we'll find more answers
farther below.

---
label: talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Description_02"}}The gloom is growing heavier as we go.
It's more and more unnerving...

---
label: talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Description_03"}}I...{{delay8}}don't like the look of this. But we
must find our answers, Link.

---
label: talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Surprise_03"}}That green light in the distance...


I'm having the strangest sensation.
This is all so ominous...

---
label: talk_07
---
{{anim type="Observation_00"}}These are ruins from an ancient
civilization.

Wait...{{delay8}} Something is written here.


Might these ruins be...{{delay8}}from the Zonai?

---
label: talk_09
---
{{anim type="Observation_01"}}These carvings...


I'm sure they're Zonai in origin. I've seen
designs like this in my studies.

The Zonai are said to have lived long ago,
in the time of earliest legend.

They possessed godlike powers and had
a prosperous civilization in the sky.

{{anim type="Description_03"}}Many history books tell us about the
Zonai, but none gives us the full picture.
Much is still unknown about them.

---
label: talk_11
---
{{anim type="Observation_00"}}Is this what the Zonai looked like?
They seem so different than us, and
such large ears...
How did the ruins from a civilization in the
sky end up here beneath the castle?

It looks like the path ahead goes even
deeper. Let's continue, Link.

---
label: talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_01"}}Link! Look here!

---
label: talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Surprise_03"}}Oh! Look at this...

---
label: talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Observation_01"}}Those statues there!

---
label: talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Surprise_00"}}Monsters?! Down here?

---
label: near_01

{{anim type="Tension_00"}}Ah!
