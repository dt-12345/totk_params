{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there, friend. You on your way to
Goron City?

Ever since Death Mountain's eruptions
stopped, getting there is so easy, any
Hylian can make the trek.
Still, walking up that steep mountain road
can really take it out of you if you're not
adequately prepared.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Buuut, {{delay8}}if you drink an {{color id="0"}}elixir made with
restless crickets{{color id="-1"}}, you can {{color id="0"}}recover from
exhaustion right away{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And what a handy coincidence {{delay8}}that I sell
restless crickets! So, what do you say?

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}No matter how exhausted you get, one
drink of a {{color id="0"}}restless-cricket-filled elixir{{color id="-1"}} will
{{color id="0"}}perk you right up{{color id="-1"}}.
I never travel without it! {{delay15}}Now, can I
interest you in some crickets?{{delay8}}

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Heya, friend! {{delay8}}You here to soak in the
hot springs? Excellent choice.{{pageBreak}}Speaking of excellent choices...{{delay15}} Do you
like {{color id="0"}}hard-boiled eggs{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}Just toss a {{color id="0"}}bird egg{{color id="-1"}} in a hot spring,
wait a little while, and poof! A perfect
hard-boiled egg every time.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Those delicious gooey yolks are to die for.{{delay15}}
Give it a try! The other patrons won't mind
a few eggs in the water.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Wondering where to get bird eggs?{{delay15}} Well,
wonder no more! Because I sell 'em.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Next time you hit the hot springs, try a
{{color id="0"}}hard-boiled egg{{color id="-1"}}. Just put a {{color id="0"}}bird egg {{color id="-1"}}in
the spring, and it'll cook while you soak.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And wow, it just so happens{{delay8}} that I sell
bird eggs! You looking to stock up?

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The rain always gets me down...{{pageBreak}}The worst part is the slick surfaces.{{delay15}}
A few drops of rain and I start slipping
and sliding off of walls.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}But there's a solution!{{delay15}} {{color id="0"}}Boil some sticky
frogs into an elixir{{color id="-1"}}, take a swig, and just
like that, you'll start {{color id="0"}}slipping less{{color id="-1"}}.
Wherever will you find sticky frogs?{{delay8}} Why,
right here, in my pack! So, how many can
I put you down for?

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you drink an {{color id="0"}}elixir of boiled sticky frogs{{color id="-1"}},
you'll hardly ever slip—even in the
pouring rain!
They're a real must in this weather.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It'd sure be handy if you knew someone
who sold sticky frogs...{{delay15}} Oh, wait, that's
me! So how 'bout it?

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello, hello, friend! Making your way to
Lanayru?{{delay8}} Then tread carefully.{{pageBreak}}Word is, these blackish clumps of {{color id="0"}}sludge{{color id="-1"}}
have been falling all over the region.{{pageBreak}}It's really sticky and gross if the sludge
lands on you, but thankfully you can
{{color id="0"}}wash it off with water{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}In other words...{{delay15}}everything will turn out
fine as long as you have a healthy supply
of {{color id="0"}}splash fruit{{color id="-1"}} on hand!
And if you don't have a healthy supply...{{delay8}}
I sell splash fruit! Need to restock?

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're heading to Lanayru, you'd be
wise to bring {{color id="0"}}splash fruit{{color id="-1"}} as a {{color id="0"}}sludge
countermeasure{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And of course, if you're low on splash
fruit, I know a guy... {{delay8}}The guy is me.
Buy my splash fruit.

---
label: GoRange_02_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hm? {{delay15}}Friend, something tells me that you
may be Lanayru-bound.

Lanayru's home to a lot of caves, and
most of their walls are wet and slippery.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you want to make sure your climbing
{{color id="0"}}grip rarely slips{{color id="-1"}}, simply knock back an
{{color id="0"}}elixir made of boiled sticky frogs{{color id="-1"}}.
And as luck would have it...{{delay8}}I sell sticky
frogs for all your elixiring needs! Care to
buy a few?

---
label: GoRange_02_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you drink an {{color id="0"}}elixir made by boiling
sticky frogs{{color id="-1"}}, you'll {{color id="0"}}slip less{{color id="-1"}} on walls,
even when they're wet!
It's a travel essential if ever there
was one!{{pageBreak}}Fresh out of sticky frogs to elixirize? {{delay8}}
Never fear, my pack is here!
