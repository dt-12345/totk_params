{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hm?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh?

Come...

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_009_b
---
to me...

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_35
---
Whose voice was that? Was it coming
from somewhere up there?

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Whoooa... Do you see that thing inside
the cloud?{{pageBreak}}Is that another boat? {{delay8}}But it's huge!

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There's tons of those little flying boats
too. You know what it reminds me of?

label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_38

{{anim type="Think_00"}}♪A line of ships soaring, built as a
passage skyward.♪

♪The god ascended to heaven, leaving
behind an ark.♪

{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}This whole thing is just like the
{{color id="0"}}Song of the Stormwind Ark{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Was that children's song true after all?!

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You heard that strange voice too, right,
Link? I'm sure I heard it say, "come
to me"!

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It's like it was calling us up there.

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_46
---
I don't see anything around here that
would lead us to Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}Maybe she went over to that ship?

---
label: Dm_RT_0010_Text_051_b_43
