{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Wow! {{delay8}}What are the odds we'd run into
each other again? Wonders never cease.

Next you're going to tell me you're also
chasing after {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey there.{{delay8}}


You wouldn't happen to also be after
{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}, would you?

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}There's treasure stashed in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere here in the {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Frontier{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And this isn't any old treasure like money
or jewels. Oh no.{{pageBreak}}This is something from Misko's personal
{{color id="0"}}clothes collection{{color id="-1"}}!

label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's no smoke without fire!{{pageBreak}}Rumor has it that part of the bandit
{{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}collection of clothes is hidden
in a cave in the Tabantha Frontier.

---
label: StartPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}That was the most exciting thing I learned
from the {{color id="0"}}treasure-hunting brothers {{color id="-1"}}at
{{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It was worth the trip to {{color id="0"}}Eldin {{color id="-1"}}in the
{{color id="0"}}northeast of Hyrule {{color id="-1"}}to visit them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're heading for the {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Frontier{{color id="-1"}},
right? {{delay15}}It's right beyond this valley.{{pageBreak}}I heard that {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure {{color id="-1"}}is supposed
to be in a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}somewhere in this area,
so I've gotten to know the region well.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Haven't found it yet though.

label: GoalPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I already know that Misko's treasure is{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
hidden in a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}in the {{color id="0"}}Tabantha Frontier{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
The rest should be a cinch.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}So why haven't I found it yet?

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I went all the way to {{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable{{color id="-1"}} in
{{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}, in the northeast of Hyrule, just to
talk to the {{color id="0"}}treasure-hunting brothers{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Then I had to walk all the way back here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been looking all this time, and still
haven't found it...{{pageBreak}}But it's raining now. This is the time to
rest up, pull yourself together, and give
your clothes time to dry.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The bandit Misko probably felt the same
way, given that {{color id="0"}}an outfit from their
collection{{color id="-1"}} is stashed away in a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} here.{{pageBreak}}They clearly had strong feelings about the
proper care and preservation of fabrics.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Just like me!
