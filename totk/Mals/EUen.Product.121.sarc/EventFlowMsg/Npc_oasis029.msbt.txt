{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}It's not enough that the intense desert

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're interested in {{color id="0"}}sand seals{{color id="-1"}}, then
you're in the right place!

Sand seals are animals that can cruise
easily through the desert, and this {{color id="0"}}shop{{color id="-1"}}
is where we rent them to travelers!
Many travelers embark on journeys into
the desert only to discover how quickly
their feet sink into the dunes.
So if you're thinking of crossing the
desert, you should make it easy on
yourself and go {{color id="0"}}sand-seal surfing{{color id="-1"}} instead!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Renting a sand seal costs {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.
Or, if you're interested in a sleigh seal—
a sand seal with a carrier—it's {{color id="0"}}50 rupees{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hey now! You aren't thinking of going and
catching a wild sand seal after I explain
things, are you?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I mean, if you did, you'd have to contend
with their {{color id="0"}}exceptional senses{{color id="-1"}}. They easily
startle at slight {{color id="0"}}sounds and tremors{{color id="-1"}}...
Unless you're really, really sneaky, they'll
run away the moment they notice you.{{delay15}}
And even then...
untether from one you've caught, and
it'll be gone faster than you can say
"I should have rented from Kohm!"

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's the difference you get if you rent
a trained sand seal! Ours have a great
temperament and are easy to control.
Renting one would be a deal at twice
the price!

Shields are key to sand-seal surfing,
