Nice ring garland!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And now, since this is your first time
with us at {{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now! You used {{color id="0"}}Lakeside Stable {{color id="-1"}}for the
first time and also {{color id="0"}}registered a horse{{color id="-1"}},
which means...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Is this your first time in the area, sir?{{pageBreak}}It's a little-known fact that our stable
receives orders from {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}
herself.
At her direction, we opened a sanctuary
for a {{color id="0"}}new animal species{{color id="-1"}}. It's {{color id="0"}}right across
the ravine{{color id="-1"}} from here.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ordinary visitors can't easily reach it,
but with a telescope or the like, you
might be able to snatch a glimpse.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Anyway, once again...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The rain is almost constant here, but once
in a while, it does let up. Like now.

When it's raining, the well behind the
stable is too full for me to go inside.

But when the skies are calm like this,
the water in the well disappears and
I can give it a good scrub.
Come to think of it, I should probably go
and do that now...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Take care not to slip!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you're that interested in ring garlands,
why not go and get one yourself?

They sell them at a place called
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, up in Necluda!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I spent a while mulling over what painting
could be worthy of such a nice frame.
Here's my thought.
When it's clear out—{{delay8}}which, granted, isn't
often around these parts—{{delay8}}you can get a
beautiful view of Floria Falls.
The best place to see it is {{color id="0"}}Floria Bridge{{color id="-1"}}
outside the stable. {{delay8}}Wouldn't the view from
there make a nice painting?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Problem is, I can't leave the stable
unattended, and even if I could, it's rare
that the weather is clear enough.
But maybe there's some other way to
get {{color id="0"}}a panoramic view of Floria Falls on a
clear day{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If someone brought me a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}}, for
instance, then I'd be able to paint a
copy and hang that up in the frame.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? Do you have {{color id="0"}}a picture of Floria Falls
on a clear day{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ah, how I'd love to put {{color id="0"}}a panoramic
picture of Floria Falls in that frame{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}A view from the bridge outside, with the
towering waterfalls of Floria Falls all
around you...
That's the kind of stunning vista that can
only be found in Faron.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes. If I'm to hang something here,
a picture of {{color id="0"}}Floria Falls{{color id="-1"}} on {{color id="0"}}a clear day{{color id="-1"}}
would be best.
It would really draw in customers, don't
you think?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But between the rainfall and all my work
here, I don't know when I'll be able to
paint something like that.

label: Com_Photo_09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}A picture of Floria Falls on a clear day...{{color id="-1"}}
If such a piece of art existed, it would be
perfect for my stable.

Like...this one?

Goodbye.

---
label: 9003

I'm not showing you.

---
label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? Did you bring me {{color id="0"}}a picture of
Floria Falls on a clear day{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}It's bad form to have a picture frame
hanging there, all sad and empty.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If only I had {{color id="0"}}a picture of Floria Falls on a
clear day{{color id="-1"}}, I'd copy it as fast as I could and
put it up there.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Do you happen to have {{color id="0"}}a picture of
Floria Falls on a clear day{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Stunning, isn't it?


That said, if you ever want me to hang
a different {{color id="0"}}picture of Floria Falls on a
clear day{{color id="-1"}}, I'll be happy to oblige.
Just show me the new picture. I'll paint
up a copy and display it instead!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Ah, the falls really pack a punch.
No matter how many times I see them,
I'm always moved beyond words.
That picture will make travelers glad they
made the long, slippery trip to Faron!

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks to you, Link, a ray of light shines
in my storm-battered stable.

Visitors to Faron may not find clear skies
outside, but in here, the mood will always
be bright and sunny!

label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway!{{delay8}} Did you want to do something
with my beloved {{color id="0"}}picture of Floria Falls on
a clear day{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Whenever I look at that picture, I get
excited all over again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's a protective charm of sorts that
has become rather popular lately.

I hear it's based on the Ring Ruins that
fell in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

You been to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}? It's up
north in Necluda.

Nice place. Definitely worth a visit.

---
label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Excuse me, but that flower decoration
is for display only.

If you want one, you'll have to make
your way to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}in Necluda
up north.
And while you're there, you can take a
gander at the Ring Ruins. I hear they're a
sight to behold!
