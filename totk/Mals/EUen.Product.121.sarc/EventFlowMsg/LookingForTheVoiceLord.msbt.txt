{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Hey, look who it is! I'd recognize that
face anywhere.

And any face I know is the face of
a friend!

Please, Link. Help yourself to anything in
this shelter. It's all yours to {{color id="0"}}use as you
see fit{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But you should probably avoid this area
in particular...

Sometimes I hear a {{color id="0"}}creepy voice {{color id="-1"}}coming
from this hole—it almost sounds like
a {{color id="0"}}demon {{color id="-1"}}growling or something.
No one else claims to hear it, but I
certainly do.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Between you and me, I kind of worry
I awakened some demon when I busted
up this wall.
And my even bigger worry is that the
demon has it out for me now...

{{size value="80"}}Robbie, Granté... My beloved family...
Goodbye forever...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Oh hey, it's you again. So you know, I've
taken the time to say all my goodbyes.

The thing is, it's always really dusty
around here, so I work overtime to clean
it all up.
Well, I was working SO hard, in fact, that
the force of my broom accidentally took
out part of this wall.
Ever since, I've been hearing this {{color id="0"}}creepy
voice {{color id="-1"}}coming from the hole I made—it
almost sounds like a {{color id="0"}}demon {{color id="-1"}}growling...
No one else claims to hear it, but I
certainly do.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}At this point, I'm pretty sure I unsettled
that demon when I busted up the wall...

So it stands to reason that if it wants
revenge, I'll be the one who's targeted!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I mean, it's always so dusty around here,
and I was working extra hard to clear it
all out.
You'd think a measly broom banging into
a wall wouldn't be enough to collapse it,
but here we are...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ever since, I sometimes hear a {{color id="0"}}creepy
voice {{color id="-1"}}coming from this hole. Ugh, it's
probably something awful, like a demon...
And that demon is definitely angry
with me.

{{size value="80"}}Robbie, Granté... Goodbye forever...{{size value="100"}}

Goodbye forever...

label: Talk03_01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I broke the wall and angered the demon.
And I'll be paying for it with my life.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}You what? You went INSIDE the hole?
Did you find the demon?!

Is...{{delay15}} Is this goodbye for me?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Wait. A demon...{{delay15}}STATUE was in there,
you say?{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I know a bit about those.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Want to know what I know?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}"A dealer in life and power, touched by
the wrath of the Goddess, fallen to ruin."

Then that must mean the horned statue
is an entity who deals in life and power!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Which would make the dais the place
where it was enshrined, back when
it was still a god.

label: Talk03_04

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}So the voice I heard was the forlorn
horned statue...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As there is the Goddess of light, then it
follows that she would have an opposite—
the horned god.
Like light and dark, one cannot exist
without the other—their power manifests
through the other's existence.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Knocking a hole in the wall? That was
fate, no doubt about it.

I can't go in there, but I'll keep this area
spick-and-span.

And I'll be sure to greet the horned statue
from here too.

Oh, and thanks, you know? Take this.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}It's Robbie's spending allowance
for next month, but now it's your
spending allowance.
Thanks for clearing this whole thing up
for me.

Right. Time to settle the ol' nerves and
get back to work!
