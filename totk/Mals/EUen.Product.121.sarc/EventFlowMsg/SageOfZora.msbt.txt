{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It is a wonderfully scenic park that
was only recently unveiled {{delay8}}atop
Ploymus Mountain.
It was once the dwelling place of fierce
monsters, and no one dared set foot
up there.
I am told that after those monsters were
defeated, the Zora of the domain
determined a park should be built there.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It is a beautiful spot, partly because it is
the source of all of the clean water that
flows into the domain.

---
label: MeetParkShido_Yona_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Oh, we are making it through somehow.{{delay8}}
I suppose.

Thankfully, clean water washes away the
sludge, so we can preserve our living
spaces with careful, continuous cleaning.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Still, there are many who have lost their
health due to that vile substance, and the
labor shortage has become dire.
That is why our investigation into the
cause of the sludge is not progressing
nearly as much as we would have liked.

---
label: MeetParkShido_Yona_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I hear the king has left the domain to
investigate the sludge.

His reasoning was that we do not have
enough Zora to get the job done without
him. Hee-hee... He is so like his son.
Everyone is looking forward to his
return. He is such a beloved and
dependable king.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The children have even gathered in the

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Prince Sidon may not be too pleased to

It is all thanks to the role we were tasked

Oh. I dearly hope it is not imprudent of

{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Link.{{delay8}} Your bond with Sidon is the stuff of
legends. Together, there is no wave so
rough that you cannot overcome it.
I hear that Yona, too, has been working
diligently in the domain. It fills my heart.
I leave all the rest up to you young ones.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}What a triumphant time it is! Wah ha ha!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ah! {{delay8}}I see you have been reunited with
your Zora armor!{{delay8}} A fitting garment for
a hero of your caliber.
Yet I doubt that you came here simply to
show me your armor. Tell me, have you
made any progress in your quest?

It is immaculate. I had no idea she could

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It appears I have no cause for concern.
The domain is in good hands. Thanks to
your help, I can focus on my recuperation.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I am sorry, Link.{{delay15}} I dearly wish that I could
believe what you have told me.

However, for now, I am sadly unable to
discern the truth of the matter.

At present there is no way to confirm or
disprove if Princess Zelda truly set that
monster upon King Dorephan.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}What is this?! {{delay15}}The sludge monster
appeared, {{delay8}}only to be vanquished by
you and Prince Sidon?
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Link...{{delay15}} I...{{delay15}} Hm.


That monster posed a grave threat to us,{{delay8}}
and you took on our burden as your own.
From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That settles it, then. I believe you. No
proof will be necessary. After all that you
have done, I lack the ability to doubt you.
Of course, there is still much
mystery surrounding the incident
with Princess Zelda.
It could be that the one who set that
monster upon King Dorephan was simply
a lookalike of Princess Zelda...
