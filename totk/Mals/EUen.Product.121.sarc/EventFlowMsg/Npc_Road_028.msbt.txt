{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This might sound strange comin' from a
Goron, but you really oughta stay away
from {{color id="0"}}Goron City {{color id="-1"}}right now.
Cooke, who's normally a nice fella, has
been turning Hylians away from his {{color id="0"}}bistro{{color id="-1"}}.

And all the workers over at {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo{{color id="-1"}}
have been slackin' off and eating these
{{color id="0"}}weird rocks{{color id="-1"}}...
I heard things had gotten bad at home,
so I rushed back.

Turns out everything I'd been hearing
was true...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I s'pose I'm partial, but the Eldin region is
a great place, if you hadn't noticed.

The place used to be nothin' more than a
big empty slab of volcanic rock.

Now you've got Cooke's {{color id="0"}}bistro {{color id="-1"}}making
food for folks from all over Hyrule.

And since YunoboCo has so many expert
miners workin for 'em, they sell {{color id="0"}}precious
stones {{color id="-1"}}at {{color id="0"}}rock-bottom prices{{color id="-1"}}.
There's also {{color id="0"}}Mine-Cart Land{{color id="-1"}}, the new
amusement park that just opened up.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You don't have to go far round here to
have a great time!
