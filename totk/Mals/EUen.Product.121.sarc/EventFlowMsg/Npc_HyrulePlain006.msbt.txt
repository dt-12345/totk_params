If I had a balloon like the one on the other

bit. Fat chance of that though.

Red hot?

label: Talk_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What's that?{{delay8}} Did the fiery passion of my
monologue catch your ear?

Well, red hot is as red hot does,
my friend.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}So a while back, Death Mountain was
super active—we're talking full-force,
non-stop, red-hot lava.
But now the lava's all cooled down and
hardened. It's even—ugh, I hate to say
it—made a {{color id="0"}}new road{{color id="-1"}} that's easy to walk!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And ease, my friend, is the opposite of
the "red hot" lifestyle.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now the route going up Death Mountain
from {{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable {{color id="-1"}}to the east, on the
other hand...
That's an old, dangerous road absolutely
crawling with monsters.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's what I call RED HOT!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But, uh...{{delay8}}my muscles aren't exactly ready
to take the heat right now, so that makes
my decision more complicated.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And there's nothing red hot about

I'll leave you to it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I could take the sedate Woodland Stable

route for a fiery adventure...

label: Talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}But the real question right now is who
does that snazzy {{color id="0"}}balloon {{color id="-1"}}belong to?

label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The lava around here has completely
cooled, so the Woodland Stable route
lacks the fiery passion I crave.
Maybe I should take the monster-laden
Foothill Stable route to the east, just to
give my journey a little more spice...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I'm, uh...{{delay15}}just not sure my muscles are
quite ready to feel the burn. This is a
tough call to make!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Wha?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi_01"}}I was finally nodding off, what is it?{{delay15}}
You wanna know what it means to be
red hot?

We need to get somewhere dry! Come on!

label: Talk_19

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}By the way, it's {{color id="0"}}harder to climb cliffs {{color id="-1"}}while
it's raining, so I'm taking a little break
until this passes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Also, if you thought cliffs being {{color id="0"}}harder to
climb {{color id="-1"}}was the worst thing about a storm,
you've clearly never been zapped.
If lightning strikes my {{color id="0"}}metal weapon{{color id="-1"}}, I'll
get {{color id="0"}}burnt to a crisp{{color id="-1"}}! That's not the kind of
