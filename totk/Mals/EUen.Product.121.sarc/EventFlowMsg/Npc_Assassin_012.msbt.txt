Y-y-{{delay15}}you surprised me...{{delay8}} Don't do that!


I thought you might've been from the Yiga
Clan for a second. {{delay15}}Hurry up and get your
research clothes on!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Huh?{{delay8}} You don't have research clothes?


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait, are you in the Yiga Clan?!{{size value="100"}}

Sure am.

---
label: 0011
---
I am not.

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You dare claim to be a part of our
clan?! {{delay8}}Absurd!

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}D-don't lie! I know the Yiga are all
masters of disguise!

Prove you don't have a Yiga uniform on
under there!{{delay8}} Take off everything you're
wearing! Oh, and ditch the weapons too! 
Try anything funny...{{delay8}}and you'll face these
furious researcher fists!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}D-{{delay8}}don't lie!{{delay15}}


If you want me to believe you...{{delay8}}take off
everything you're wearing! You could have
a Yiga uniform on under there!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, wait.{{delay8}} No, you couldn't. You're already
pretty clothes-less as it is.

{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Phew, what a relief!{{delay15}} But seriously, please
don't scare me like that!

---
label: talk_1014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful"}}Tch...{{delay8}} Then it looks like I have no choice
but to raise the alarm.

---
label: talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Wow, you really did it!


Well now.{{delay8}} I can finally relax...

---
label: talk_1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}H-{{delay8}}how many times to do I have to say it?!


If you want me to believe you,{{delay8}} come back
without any clothes or weapons! How else
can I know you're not in the Yiga Clan?
{{anim type="Angry_01"}}If you talk to me again as you are...{{delay8}}there's
gonna be trouble!

---
label: talk_1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I gave you all those warnings, and you're
still geared up for a fight!{{delay8}} You, you...{{delay8}}

So what are you up to?

---
label: 0021

Well, you take care now.

---
label: talk_1015

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You see all these {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} here,
yes?{{delay8}} Is this a supply point, perhaps?

{{color id="0"}}You find these occasionally{{color id="-1"}} in the Depths,
though I have no idea who leaves them
in these places...

---
label: talk_1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}But I'm grateful. When my vehicle's
damaged, I like to do a little...borrowing.

Speaking of, could I perhaps borrow{{delay8}} your
life?{{delay8}} Well, Link?

{{anim type="Think"}}What sort of fool removes all his gear
because a stranger asks him to?!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Wait...


Why would I let you get away{{delay8}} when you've
left yourself wide open?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Gyah! {{delay8}}Who?!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Phew, just a fellow Yiga.{{delay8}} Need to stock up
on {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}?
