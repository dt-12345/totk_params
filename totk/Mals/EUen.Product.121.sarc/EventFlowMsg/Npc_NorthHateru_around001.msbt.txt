Say, are you aware of the mystery of the
{{color id="0"}}geoglyphs {{color id="-1"}}that have sprung up all over
the world after the Upheaval?{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm an adventurer looking into those
geoglyphs. {{delay8}}Even if I haven't made much

have seen {{color id="0"}}a geoglyph in the area{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}But I've walked up and down these hills

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm still chasing down the biggest mystery
in Hyrule—the {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I rushed over as soon as I heard the
rumors that a geoglyph was spotted
around here.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I take it that if you're here, you're after
the same thing. {{delay15}}Well? {{delay8}}I nailed it, didn't I?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}The problem is, I've walked all around this
area but haven't found the {{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}that
brought me here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}But complaining about it won't get any
results. I'll rest for a bit and pick up the

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I came because I heard that one of the
{{color id="0"}}geoglyphs {{color id="-1"}}that started showing up all
over after the Upheaval is around here.{{pageBreak}}But I've been up and down these hills,
and haven't found it yet. {{delay15}}Maybe I need
to change my approach.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I could try climbing up to a {{color id="0"}}high place{{color id="-1"}}
and looking down, or even just standing

those {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} that appeared after
the Upheaval.{{pageBreak}}I've seen the geoglyph here, {{delay8}}but now I
have to decide whether to look for others
or to delve into the {{color id="0"}}dragon {{color id="-1"}}mystery.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You heard about this? {{delay15}}Some folks say
there are these legendary creatures called
dragons, right here in Hyrule.{{pageBreak}}Lots of people claim to have seen one.{{delay8}}
And I know they exist, because when I
was a girl, I saw one too!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Though my memory of it is pretty
hazy.{{delay15}} I must've been too awestruck
by its majesty.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}One thing most rumors have in common is
that dragons are seen {{color id="0"}}flying through the
sky{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}So I should search from high ground.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Any of that catch your interest? {{delay15}}Then you
should keep an eye on the sky too!{{pageBreak}}Well, that's all from me today. {{delay15}}See you

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I found the geoglyph near here, {{delay8}}but I can't

called dragons live right here in Hyrule.{{pageBreak}}Most rumors agree that dragons are seen

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The latest I've heard is that some people
have seen dragons dancing in the sky
before {{color id="0"}}disappearing into the earth{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}And on the flipside, others say they've

both {{color id="0"}}disappearing into the earth{{color id="-1"}} and

they're not always on the surface. {{delay8}}Seems
there's some real depth to this mystery.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Dragons really do embody the spirit of

extent of it? {{delay15}}A rare few claim that there's
a fourth type as well. {{delay8}}Or so they think.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Somewhere in all that confusion, the truth

There are people who claim to have

a trail of light falling from a dragon that
was dancing through the sky.{{pageBreak}}The stories of what they found vary. I've

sure what body part that'd come from.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Dragons are supposed to be immense in
