How strange...

---
label: talk0000

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Nothing like going to stretch your legs
and ending up in the strangest place...

Everything looks the same down here.
It would be so easy to get turned around.

I wonder if the people who originally made
this place got lost in it all the time too.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hey, what do you want? Were you lurking
in the shadows there, eavesdropping on
what I was saying?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh... You're that voe that everyone has
been talking about, right?

If I were younger, I might have been
surprised to see you here, but at my
age... {{delay8}}Well, very little surprises me.
Disappointed that I wasn't shocked and
aghast at the very sight of you? Heh.

Anyway, I'm going to go. I'm feeling
a little parched, so maybe something
to drink at the {{color id="0"}}canteen{{color id="-1"}}...

Hmm?

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you Yiga really have so little to do that
you can loiter around here?

Whatever. {{delay8}}We won't have any trouble as
long as you stop bothering me. Right now.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I thought the {{color id="0"}}canteen {{color id="-1"}}was around here
somewhere...{{delay15}} Huh?

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I swear the {{color id="0"}}fruit shop{{color id="-1"}} was right around
here... {{delay15}}Huh?

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh. You're that voe that folks have been
talking about. Have you already figured
out how to get around the shelter?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I heard this place was built a long, long
time ago. I wonder if the people that
made it got lost in it too...

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Now then... I think it's about time I put in
an appearance at the {{color id="0"}}canteen{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Now then...{{delay8}} I think I'll go track down
some {{color id="0"}}fruit {{color id="-1"}}or something.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The shelter may be cramped, and I don't
think I'll ever actually like it... But at least
the canteen is all right.
After all, the back of this room is right
{{color id="0"}}under the jail{{color id="-1"}}, you know.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Hearing the sound of a voe's voice every
so often, even muffled through a wall,
makes all the drinks taste just a bit better.

label: talk0008

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh, no bananas at all... And here I was wanting to
make {{color id="0"}}fried bananas{{color id="-1"}} for the first time in a while.

Coat a banana in {{color id="0"}}Tabantha wheat{{color id="-1"}}, fry it, then mix in
a bit of {{color id="0"}}cane sugar{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Crispy on the outside, melted and gooey on the
inside... Great, I've made myself even more hungry
just thinking about it.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What?{{delay8}} If you're here about the {{color id="0"}}cooking
class{{color id="-1"}}, it isn't being held at the moment.

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What?{{delay8}} I told you already—the {{color id="0"}}cooking
class{{color id="-1"}} isn't being held right now.

Cooking class?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Before the sand shroud settled in, Ashai
was teaching a cooking class here.

You see, you can get really far in life—and
in love—if you have a solid grasp of the
essentials of cooking.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But she has so many students now that
her other class, "Voe and You," takes up
all her time.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}So she's opened this place up for
everyone's use.

The {{color id="0"}}cookbooks{{color id="-1"}} here are really useful too.
If you're planning to do any cooking at all,
you should definitely give them a read.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}{{size value="100"}}I thought there were supposed to be two
cookbooks here... Where could the other
one have gone?

It cannot be read from here.
