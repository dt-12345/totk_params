{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}} is investigating

who works with the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}}.
They're studying ruins all over though.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}} has an {{color id="0"}}expert on

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}With the Gerudo here, I should really

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Ever since I saw someone fall from one

practically nothing else.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Gah! The Gerudo came all this way to
help us keep watch, and I'm getting
distracted. {{delay15}}Sorry. I'll shut up about it...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}in a second...but first, did you know
there's a {{color id="0"}}sky-island expert {{color id="-1"}}on the {{color id="0"}}Zonai
