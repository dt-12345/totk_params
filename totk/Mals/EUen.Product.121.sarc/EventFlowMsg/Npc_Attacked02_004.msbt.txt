{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK, let's start with the basics.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I'm sure you know that Hyrule has warm
regions and cold regions, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Well, just like most folks, our different
buggy friends prefer different climates
depending on their needs.
So warm regions like Eldin are often
home to {{color id="0"}}summerwing butterflies{{color id="-1"}} and
{{color id="0"}}warm darners{{color id="-1"}}.
Meanwhile, {{color id="0"}}cold darners{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}winterwing
butterflies{{color id="-1"}} prefer cold regions like Hebra.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}So you see, if you know what kind of bugs
live where you're heading, it makes the
journey that much more fun!

Throw either of them in a pot with some
monster parts, and you can make yourself
elixirs that give electricity resistance.
{{anim type="LaughS"}}Of course, I can't bring myself to do that,
no matter how stormy it might get. I just
love my bug buddies too much!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Speaking of storms, {{color id="0"}}daytime rain showers{{color id="-1"}}
are the perfect time to find thunderwing
butterflies and electric darners.
{{anim type="Happy"}}You don't need compound eyes to pay
close attention to the weather and the

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I prefer to watch {{color id="0"}}winterwing butterflies{{color id="-1"}}
glide through the snowy air. They're such

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you look around, you'll definitely be

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I've been looking to get my hands on one,

I've found that even a wooden stick with a

There are a number of different kinds in

fascinating uses!
There are {{color id="0"}}bladed rhino beetles{{color id="-1"}}, which can
be made into muscle-stimulating elixirs...

On the other hand, {{color id="0"}}rugged rhino beetles{{color id="-1"}}
can really toughen up someone's body if
they're used in elixirs instead!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But both are dull compared to the
{{color id="0"}}energetic rhino beetles{{color id="-1"}}. I mean that

If that excites you, make a note that
energetic rhino beetles are found in
the Akkala and eastern Faron regions.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh! One more thing... Rhino beetles don't
come out during the day. {{color id="0"}}Nighttime {{color id="-1"}}is
