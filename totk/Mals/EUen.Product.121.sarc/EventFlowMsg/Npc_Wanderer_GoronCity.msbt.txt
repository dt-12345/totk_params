{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If it isn't Link! Have you come here
looking for {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} too?

We're in the area after hearing there may
be some out here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Link! I have some new information I'd like
to share regarding the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}
we'd spoken about.
I spent some more time with literature
about the temple.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}And it seems probable that within the
temple lies a clue even more thrilling
than the geoglyphs themselves!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I felt more excited than a schoolboy who
caught a fireproof lizard! I'm determined
to unravel that clue as soon as possible.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hm... We don't have enough information
at this point, so we need to research each
lead with scrutiny.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The geoglyphs that appeared with the
Upheaval and the phenomena happening
across Hyrule...
There must be a connection...but what
is it?

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}The {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}} and the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}},
hmmm...

I feel certain that if we investigate them
both, we will uncover a clue that explains
the Upheaval.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}There are reports that a geoglyph has
been sighted around here too. I hope
they don't portend ill things ahead...
