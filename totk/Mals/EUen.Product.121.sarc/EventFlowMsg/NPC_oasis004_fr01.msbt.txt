I hope they're all OK...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I hope Captain Flaxel and the squad are
all right...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, hey. {{delay8}}Things are pretty dicey ahead.
{{color id="0"}}Captain Flaxel's monster-control-crew
squad{{color id="-1"}} is executing an operation there.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's a pirate ship moored on the {{color id="0"}}shore
of Menoat River to the west{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But never fear! The monster-control crew
is on their way to take them out.

label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Why am I not out there with them?{{delay15}}
Because I'm here to keep them fed!
I'm a cook!
In fact, I just threw together a new recipe
while I was holding down the fort.{{delay8}} Here,
give it a try!{{delay15}}

label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh, scratch that. {{delay15}}You've already got so
many dishes in your pouch, you can't
carry even one more.{{delay8}} Darn.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}If you're confident in your ability to
swing a sword, you should go {{color id="0"}}help
Captain Flaxel and the others{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Captain Flaxel's squad of the monster-
control crew {{color id="-1"}}is executing an operation up
ahead! {{delay8}}Please take care as you approach.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}She's up against pirates... {{delay15}}I just hope the
whole squad makes it back safely.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I made a bunch of food while keeping an
eye on things here. Here, have a little!

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That was left behind because maintenance
wasn't completed on it by the time the
strike began.
The captain left me with clear orders—{{delay8}}
"Just give it to whoever wants it!"{{delay8}} So if
you'd like it, it's yours.

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I really hope Captain Flaxel and the squad
make it through all right...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You're back? At this hour?{{delay15}} Good morning,
early riser!

---
label: Talk_1001_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh!{{delay15}} You're back, I see.

---
label: Talk_1001_01_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Good to see you again!{{delay15}} I'm kind of
surprised you're not asleep right now.

---
label: Talk_1001_01_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, hello.{{delay15}} Not exactly the most relaxing
weather today, is it?

---
label: Talk_1001_01_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, hi there!{{delay15}} It sure is chilly around here,
isn't it?

---
label: Talk_1001_01_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Brrr... {{delay15}}I'd offer you a better greeting, but
I think I'd freeze if I stepped away from
the fire.

---
label: Talk_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This area is dangerous. {{color id="0"}}Captain Flaxel's
squad of the monster-control crew {{color id="-1"}}is
executing a strike nearby.

---
label: Talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Some monsters built a {{color id="0"}}fort {{color id="-1"}}near here and
have been terrorizing the area ever since.{{pageBreak}}But Captain Flaxel and squad three are on
the case!

---
label: Talk_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Oh, me? I'm the cook assigned to Captain
Flaxel's squad. I'm watching over this
camp while they're away!
I've also been trying out some new
recipes in the meantime. {{delay8}}I'd love it
if you gave my latest a try!{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It's a big fort, so the squad's probably in
for a rough fight. I wish they had a {{color id="0"}}really
confident fighter to help them{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Captain Flaxel's monster-control-crew
squad {{color id="-1"}}is executing a strike just nearby!
{{delay8}}Careful not to get caught up in it.

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}They're up against monsters that built a
huge fort... {{delay15}}I just hope the captain and
crew don't get hurt during the strike.

---
label: Talk_1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Captain Flaxel recaptured that weapon.
You should have seen the way the
monster was swinging it around.
"As long as it's out of monster hands,{{delay8}}
I don't care who takes it!"{{delay8}} Those were
her orders, so it's yours if you want it!
