{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey, I know you!{{delay8}} You're the fella who
showed the All-Clucking Cucco for what
it was. {{delay8}}A sham. A Yiga Clan trap.
I would have stayed fooled, if not for you.
So...thanks!

Still, I couldn't help wondering if there
might've something to that prophecy.{{delay15}}
Now here I am, in Akkala.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you ever heard of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}}
It's a {{color id="0"}}collection of rare clothes{{color id="-1"}} gathered
up and hidden away by the bandit Misko!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm fairly sure a piece of that treasure is
tucked away in a cave here in Akkala!

You helped me out of a jam, so I'll tell you
everything I know. If you're interested,
just ask!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, fella! {{delay15}}Want me to bend your ear
about {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Wellll, truth be told, I don't have any
information to share.{{pageBreak}}Wish I could say different. I heard tell that
this pair of treasure-hunting brothers
might have a lead...{{pageBreak}}But I went way out west to {{color id="0"}}the cave near
Foothill Stable {{color id="-1"}}to talk to them, and
they still wouldn't tell me anything.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I'm sorry to say that I don't have any
info on {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure {{color id="-1"}}right now...{{pageBreak}}I went out west to a {{color id="0"}}cave near Foothill
Stable{{color id="-1"}} to ask those treasure-hunting
brothers to share what they'd heard...
But they wouldn't tell me anything. So
much for respecting your elders...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}At first I thought I might ask the horse
god {{color id="0"}}Malanya{{color id="-1"}} to grant my wish.{{pageBreak}}But I'm too scared to get any closer, so
I'll just do my wishing from here...

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That's why I plan on going to {{color id="0"}}East Akkala
Stable{{color id="-1"}} and making a wish to the horse
god Malanya. Maybe he can guide me!{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
East Akkala Stable is an establishment on
the {{color id="0"}}eastern edge {{color id="-1"}}of Hyrule.{{pageBreak}}Sure, I might have been tricked into
going, but I've always wanted to see
what the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}} had to offer.
There's joy in any journey, so long as
you look.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Rumor has it there are rare clothes
stashed somewhere on Lomei Labyrinth
Island {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}} of here.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}But it's waaay out in the ocean. {{delay8}}If I tried
swimming there, I'd end up very drowned.

Makes you wish there was an {{color id="0"}}undersea
tunnel {{color id="-1"}}between here and there, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Rumor has it there are rare clothes
stashed somewhere on Lomei Labyrinth
Island {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}} of here.
But it's so far off coast, there's no way to
swim there. You'd need an {{color id="0"}}undersea
tunnel{{color id="-1"}} or something to reach it.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Now, this has nothing to do with any of
Misko's outfits, but...

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You ever wear {{color id="0"}}froggy clothes{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}They're
said to keep you nice and comfortable
when it's raining. Like now.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}There are some on display at the Lucky
Clover Gazette, I hear, but that's so far
to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}. All the way in Hebra!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Once I spruce up my wardrobe with a few
Misko pieces, maybe I'll go west to {{color id="0"}}Lucky
Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}They've got a set of {{color id="0"}}froggy clothes{{color id="-1"}} there.
Wouldn't it be nice to travel through the
rain in comfort?

label: Talk_01_3

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Y'know, those clothes really do look
froggy. A perfect design for a rainy day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}That's a great outfit, fella! You're making
an old man jealous.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I went to {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}} to make a
wish to the horse god {{color id="0"}}Malanya{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I asked him to help me find the treasure!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wishes are tricky things. If it doesn't
come true right away, I can always go
back and make the wish again!
Besides, this gives me a chance to finally
explore the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}There's joy in the
journey, treasure or no treasure.
