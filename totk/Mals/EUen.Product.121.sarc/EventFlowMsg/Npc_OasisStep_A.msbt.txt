{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is the jail.


Even though you have special permission
to be in Gerudo Town, I still won't let you
past this point.
Really, the only way into jail is to {{color id="0"}}break
our rules{{color id="-1"}}.

Voe are normally not allowed inside our
town—the one in jail broke that rule, so
he's locked up.
And, even though you have permission
to be here, if you break the rules...

you'll join him in jail.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I already told you that's the jail cell.
The only way to end up in there is by
{{color id="0"}}breaking the rules{{color id="-1"}} of Gerudo Town!
Voe are normally not allowed inside
Gerudo Town—the one in jail broke that
rule, so he's locked up.
And, even though you have permission

Gerudo Town...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Everyone has gone back into town, but
I'm stuck here on guard duty, keeping
watch on this voe.
Ugh, stupid voe...

for visitors!

Only {{color id="0"}}prisoners{{color id="-1"}} are supposed to be in
there—like that voe who tried to get
into town!
But you... You're the chief's guest,
aren't you?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}The fact that you got in there, on purpose
or by accident, without me knowing would
be embarrassing, so...
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_00"}}Get out of there before anyone sees you!{{delay8}}
Come on!

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Wh— Again?!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}How do you keep getting in there?
Some kind of secret tunnel? No, it
isn't possible.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_00"}}Get out of there before anyone sees you!{{delay8}}
Come on!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I hope you've realized that it's better to
behave yourself... And in any case, the
captain sent word to let you out.
But I'd better not see your rule-breaking
face here again!

---
label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Had enough time to think about what you
did to end up here?{{delay8}} I hope so, since the
captain sent word to let you out.
But I'd better not see your rule-breaking
face here again! Nobody likes a voe
who can't take a hint!

word to let you out, anyway.

Just don't do anything to get thrown back
in there!

Wait...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Now that I look closely... You're the
voe from before!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Do you realize you're dressed like a
member of a group that intends us harm?

You'd put fear into many people here if
you went around dressed like that, even
though we know you aren't one of them.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}So if you want out of there, you'll need to
change your clothes first!

Put more clothes on!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I will admit you are now wearing more
clothing, but... Do you realize that is the
outfit of a group that intends us harm?
Even though we know you aren't one of
them, you'd scare many people here if
you went around dressed like that.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}So if you want out of there, you'll need to
change into something else first!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You just don't learn, do you?


I don't show mercy to anyone who breaks

Take some time to think about how rules
exist for a reason.

At any rate, could you put some clothes

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Listen, I know you're a special voe, but
