{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}As I recall, you and I first met at
Woodland Stable, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}We didn't know each other, and yet you
went out of your way to help us. I think
about that often.{{pageBreak}}The next time we need to travel a long
distance, you'd be my first choice for
our driver.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I hope that all of us in the Stable
Trotters—I mean, the Stable Heroes—
can count on you for years to come.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now that the troupe is back together,
we've been performing nonstop. Our
conductor is elated!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And truth to tell, he's not the only one.{{delay15}}
I'd forgotten how it felt for us all to play
together as a band.{{pageBreak}}It's so much fun!{{pageBreak}}Playing my chosen instrument in my
favorite place with my dearest friends...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I owe a lot to you for the chance to do
what I love most again.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look how happy our conductor is.{{pageBreak}}His enthusiasm is infectious. It inspires
me to play my best.{{pageBreak}}He really loves the arts, and he's a
staunch supporter of our troupe.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Though as you can see, his melodic sense is, well...{{delay15}}
None of us pay much attention to his conducting.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}It was our conductor who established the
troupe to brighten up the lives of people
who came to the stables.{{pageBreak}}He traveled the whole world searching
for musicians. We wouldn't be here
without him.{{pageBreak}}For that, and for being a joy in so many
people's lives, we'll stick with him all
the way.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I know what you're thinking.{{pageBreak}}How can a man who flails his baton
around at random be a conductor?{{size value="80"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And I'll grant you that he has absolutely no
melodic sense.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It was our conductor's grandfather who
built this stable to begin with, you see.{{pageBreak}}He was raised from a young age with
the importance of being a light in
people's lives.{{pageBreak}}When he realized that people and animals
alike can enjoy music, he decided to form
a musical troupe.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I know he looks a little outlandish, but he
comes through when it counts.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well...{{delay15}}there aren't any rules against this
kind of behavior, I suppose, but...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Aren't you embarrassed to be strutting
around in virtually nothing?
