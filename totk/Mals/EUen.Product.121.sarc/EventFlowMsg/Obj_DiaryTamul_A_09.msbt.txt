On that day, the land shook, and huge
chasms that seemed bottomless opened
in the ground.{{pageBreak}}The clouds billowed and rolled as floating
islands appeared in the skies, raining
chunks of ruins down on us.{{pageBreak}}And strangest of all, Hyrule Castle began
to float in the air. It's hard to believe this
is our world now.{{pageBreak}}Whoever started calling it {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}
had the right idea.

An evil-looking haze surged up from the
chasms that opened on the surface.{{pageBreak}}The haze weakens everything it touches.
People fall ill when exposed to it, and it
has another curious property as well.{{pageBreak}}As if guided, the miasma coiled about our
weapons. There isn't a single weapon we
know of that hasn't decayed as a result.{{pageBreak}}We're calling the stuff {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.

We decided to call the islands hanging in
the sky "{{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}." Simple and to the
point is best, it seemed.{{pageBreak}}I suspect, based on the design motifs on
them, that the ruins falling from the sky
are Zonai in origin.{{pageBreak}}We still understand so little about the
Zonai civilization. All we know is that it
flourished in the sky.{{pageBreak}}While it's true that the Upheaval has
posed major problems in every aspect
of life in Hyrule...{{pageBreak}}I can't deny that it's also presented us
with an opportunity to answer questions
we've long had about our history. Hmmm.

We've started investigating the fallen
ruins and the sky islands.{{pageBreak}}Our best lead is a report from the chief of
Kakariko Village that some unusual ruins
and engraved slabs have fallen there.{{pageBreak}}I decided to have the Zonai Survey Team
work out of Kakariko Village in Necluda,
southeast of Lookout Landing.{{pageBreak}}The ruins that fell on Kakariko Village are
massive. You can see them from all the
way here at Lookout Landing.

The crater left by the castle's rise is still
spewing gloom. It's kept us from making
any progress with our investigation.{{pageBreak}}We still don't know anything about where
the princess and Link have gone.{{pageBreak}}The Upheaval occurred very soon after
Princess Zelda and Link left to explore
beneath Hyrule Castle.{{pageBreak}}I fear the two events are related...
