handing these out to the schoolkids!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, now you want to help?! {{delay8}}Then start
picking them up and loading them on
the cart.{{pageBreak}}I'll make you a deal. If you get all {{color id="0"}}{{delay8}}{{number14 ref="CollectObject_MiniGame_MaxGoodsNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}of
them for me, I'll pay you.{{pageBreak}}But if you're serious about helping, I want
to see them all in that cart at the end.

---
label: Talk06_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, and you gotta be careful loading the
toys.{{delay8}} They tend to fall out if they're not all
the way in.

---
label: Talk06_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I want to get moving, so make this quick,
OK? I'll be keeping track of time.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Uh, hold on a sec.{{pageBreak}}You're not thinking of pocketing any of
my seals, I hope. {{delay8}}These are handmade.{{delay8}}
For children.

---
label: Talk07_1
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I said I'd pay you if you bring 'em back,
but this is kinda your fault, so...

---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm thinking I'll have you do it again.{{pageBreak}}I mean, you didn't seem to have any
trouble picking them up last time. {{delay8}}So you
can do it {{color id="0"}}even quicker than before{{color id="-1"}}, right?!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course I'll pay you for loading them all
for me.

---
label: Talk061_6

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}After an emotional-damages fee of {{color id="0"}}20

label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey, {{delay8}}there are still stuffed toys scattered
all over. {{delay8}}I thought we agreed you'd gather
all {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="CollectObject_MiniGame_MaxGoodsNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} of them?{{pageBreak}}You're not really going to leave them here
after we made a deal, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Nice work! {{delay8}}I didn't think you'd manage
to load them all up in so short a time.

---
label: Talk11_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}In fact, you did it even quicker than last
time. {{delay8}}You're pretty good at this! {{delay8}}I mean
that—you've been a huge help.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So yeah, here's your pay. Your deposit is

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Wait, this isn't all of the plushes!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Though loading even {{number14 ref="CollectObject_MiniGame_CurrentScore_SunaDoll" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} for me helped.{{delay15}}
You tried, I suppose. {{delay8}}I'll at least return
your deposit.

---
label: Talk11_2

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Wait, {{number14 ref="CollectObject_MiniGame_CurrentScore_SunaDoll" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them? What was I paying
you for?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Great question, me! If I've got to do all
