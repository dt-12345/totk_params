Link! {{delay8}}I'm impressed you were able to
make it to the domain!
The roads are muddied up with the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You really are amazing, Linn...{{delay15}} Uh, Link.{{delay15}}
You...{{delay15}} Um...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, whatever! I'm just going to go ahead

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You're more than just "Link" to me.{{delay15}}
I hope you'll forgive me for using my

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}A merchant boy who was staying here
used it regularly, until the recent

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Us Zora {{delay8}}sleep in the comforting embrace
of fresh water rather than beds.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}That is why we prepared a special water

{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}There's no sludge on it, of course, so you
