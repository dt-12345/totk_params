{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}C'mon, don't say that! You've got to let
me cast my line into the Depths too.

I'm capable of deciphering some {{color id="0"}}Zonai

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I mean, your skills would be super helpful
to me... You're the one in charge of the
Zonai Survey Team, after all.
But aren't you heading up the {{color id="0"}}Ring
Ruins{{color id="-1"}} investigation in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}},
anyway, Tauro?
That's where your focus should be. Those
fallen ruins are huge and exciting! Big
enough to {{color id="0"}}see from{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}!
So, please, finish your work there before
asking to join in new research.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Tauro {{color id="-1"}}is an amazing person. And he's a
first-rate archaeologist too!

But he loves Zonai research so much
that he'll bolt from a project to chase
any new discoveries.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Aw, c'mon! At least let me tell you some

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you!


I'm sure everyone will feel better knowing
you're on the case.

Y'know... I'm curious about what I heard
about Hyrule Castle too. Doc is chasing
that, so I think it'll be OK.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Besides, my discovery might hold a clue
about finding Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Well, I'll explain everything to you.
This way!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you been to all {{color id="0"}}four {{color id="-1"}}of the {{color id="0"}}Ring
Ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell around the village yet?{{pageBreak}}Most of them broke apart when they
landed. We found a {{color id="0"}}stone slab with
some writing {{color id="-1"}}inside each of the sites.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I deciphered the inscriptions and found
out they'd been written by those the
ancients knew as {{color id="0"}}sages{{color id="-1"}}.
My guess is that the floating Ring Ruin
also has a stone slab with even more
details about these {{color id="0"}}sages{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But Princess Zelda has put her foot down
and forbidden anyone from going inside,
so there's no way to know.

---
label: talk0117
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Princess Zelda ordered everyone to stay
out of the floating Ring Ruins. It's a hard
thing to ask of us, but she's the princess.
Nothing to do in the meantime but keep
investigating the other ruins.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Have you been to them yet? There's {{color id="0"}}four{{color id="-1"}}
other {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} around the village.

Most of them broke apart on impact.
Inside each site, we found an intriguing
stone slab.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you ask me, these slabs will be the
key unlocking the mysteries of the
Zonai civilization!

---
label: talk0123
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What's up?


I can't stop thinking about that floating
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: talk0112
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I don't plan on disobeying Princess
Zelda's orders, but it's not easy to abide
by them, and I'll tell you why.
Each of the other {{color id="0"}}four Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}we're
allowed to enter has a stone slab with
Zonai writing on it.
They're precious artifacts, with records
from an ancient people about purported
sages.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's got to be a fifth slab in that
floating Ring Ruin with even more
information on the sage.
I'm beside myself imagining all the details
we might be missing out on!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hm? {{delay8}}What are you doing out at this hour?

---
label: talk0114

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're not going to find much of interest
in the research documents here unless
you're into that kind of thing.
However, if you're interested in anything
Zonai related, poke around some of the
other researchers' tents.
Some are knowledgeable about the
{{color id="0"}}sky islands {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}. That might
appeal to you more.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I think the only one who likes visiting
this kind of place is the village chief.

She's just as passionate about her
research as we are.

And she's taken to deciphering Zonai
script like a fish to water!

She's so good, in fact, it feels like a waste
to stick her on chief duties.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I'm getting off track. You're interested
in Zonai stuff, yeah?

The documents here might be too high-
level for you, but the other researchers
love to chat about their work. Just ask!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Link, have you been feeling the urge to

I'd encourage you to explore the Ring

like hands-on study!
A {{color id="0"}}translation of the text{{color id="-1"}} has been placed

If you're curious, it's all there to be read.

I'm from a little {{color id="0"}}fishing village {{color id="-1"}}in the

label: talk0118

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I knew there'd be something big tucked
away in that floating Ring Ruin, but this
was bigger than I imagined.
The moment Paya set eyes on those
ruins, she called the Zonai Survey Team
right away.
It was the right call, but that's no
surprise. Every time I look at these
ruins, I'm in awe of her effectiveness.
The chief sure is something, isn't she?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thanks to your contributions, Link,
we've learned new things about the
age of legends.{{pageBreak}}Wortsworth told me all about how much
you've helped him. He's been worked up
with excitement for a while now.{{pageBreak}}And thanks to you, I got a look at some

go around!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even though we've deciphered the stone
slabs, we have to continue investigating
the Ring Ruins.{{pageBreak}}The most minute detail could actually
be meaningful.{{pageBreak}}Or something in the debris could have a
medicinal purpose. There's always
the potential for new discoveries.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}This is why it's crucial for us to continue
our research.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}That whole story about Princess Zelda

myself properly.{{pageBreak}}Sorry about that. Once again, my name

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Trust me, I understand. If I could run
around in nothing but my unmentionables,
I just might.
But there's a certain amount of decorum
required in my field. Especially when Paya
is around.
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother so much with
clothing. Better to feel the breeze on my
skin while I work!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It warms my heart to see I've found a
kindred spirit in you, Link.

resurrected!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That is quite the getup. I'd love to try
it on, myself.
