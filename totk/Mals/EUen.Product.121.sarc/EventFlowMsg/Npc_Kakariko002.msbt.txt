{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Master Link... Good morning.

---
label: talk0124

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Master Link... Hello.

---
label: talk0125
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Master Link... Good evening.

---
label: talk0132
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Master Link... Thank you for stopping by,
even with all the rain.

---
label: talk0133
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}M-M...{{delay8}}Master Link! That is to say... Um...{{delay15}}


I'm terribly grateful that you've come to
speak with me. Truly. However...

You're, um...{{delay8}}just a bit...{{delay15}}a bit too...{{delay8}}um...{{delay8}}
just a bit underdressed, don't you think? 

---
label: talk0140
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}M-M...{{delay8}}Master Link... Ahem, I...{{delay15}} Um...


I have certainly come a long way when it
comes to my shyness, especially around
you.{{delay15}} Oh! Around heroes LIKE you, I mean!
Still, it would help a great deal if...{{delay15}} That is
to say, if it's not too much trouble...{{delay15}}
Could you maybe put a shirt on?

---
label: talk0152
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Master Link...{{delay15}} I am always happy to see
you, of course. It's just...{{delay15}}well...{{delay15}}

While I have somehow gotten used to
Mr. Tauro's state of dress, when it comes
to you... I, um...
I was wondering if maybe you wouldn't
mind...{{delay15}}wearing a little more clothing.{{delay15}}
Um, just for modesty's sake. {{delay15}}If that's OK.{{delay15}}

---
label: talk0153
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Master Link...{{delay15}} As you are well aware, we Sheikah
have a deeply twisted history with that mask
you're wearing.
Some even feel a rush of fear just looking at it.{{delay15}}
Out of respect for that, would you mind terribly
taking it off while in our village? Please?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0154
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}To us Sheikah, that garb is a symbol of something
truly loathsome.

As chief, I cannot allow myself to be seen speaking
to someone dressed like that.{{delay8}} To that end, please
excuse me, Master Link.{{size value="100"}}

As chief, it is up to me...

I must not rest...not yet...

---
label: talk0115
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Master Link...{{delay8}} Is there anything you need
from me?

I haven't discerned anything about
Princess Zelda's whereabouts, so I'm
not sure I can be of any help to you.
However, my plan is to investigate the
Ring Ruins as thoroughly as possible.

Dorian, my aide, does not seem too happy
about it, but I believe this falls under my
duty as chief, and so it must be done.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}That's all I have for you at the moment...{{delay15}}
Please stay as long as you please.

---
label: talk0116
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It seems my knowledge was useful
to Tauro and his colleague for their
investigation. I'm glad.
I believe that deepening our examination
of the Ring Ruins falls under my duty as
chief. Even still...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}In retrospect, I can see that I perhaps
got a bit carried away with this task...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}From now on, I intend to turn my focus
firmly toward the villagers. As their chief,
it is up to me to watch over the village.
Duty aside... Know that I am always
praying for your safety, Master Link.
Always.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Please... Take care of yourself as surely
as you take care of the rest of Hyrule.

---
label: talk0117
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Even though I've seen them many times
by now...

Whenever I approach the Ring Ruins,
my feet inexplicably stop in their tracks.

I wonder...for what purpose were they
built? And by whom?

---
label: talk0118
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's gotten quite late. Please rest
yourself, Master Link.

Upon exiting the structure, there's an inn
to the right. I hope...you find peaceful
sleep there.

---
label: talk0114
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I must follow your example and spend as
much time as I can out there ensuring
that the villagers are doing well.
I know that everyone has their own
worries weighing on them...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I think of their worries as pages in the
diary of our village. One day, I hope they
will have faded into a distant memory.

---
label: talk0126
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I must attend to my duties, so sadly I
cannot show you around. However, I...

I hope that you will stay as long as you
please. You are never a stranger here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}This is a {{color id="0"}}map of our village{{color id="-1"}}. It marks the
locations of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

Members of the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team {{color id="-1"}}can
be found at each location.

I encourage you to try speaking with
them. I hope that you will.

The team includes those who know a fair
bit about the sky islands. There's even a
gloom specialist.
They can speak knowledgeably on a
variety of topics.

---
label: talk0130
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I must do something to make up for
becoming so immersed in figuring
out the Ring Ruins.
I truly value my time with the villagers.
From now on, I will go out of my way to
make that much more apparent.
Please speak to the villagers as well,
Master Link. Your presence has a way of
bringing comfort to those around you.

---
label: talk0131
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}During my investigation of the Ring Ruins,
I learned the importance of observing
anything and everything in your vicinity.
I will use this newfound wisdom to closely
observe the villagers and see what I can
see with my own two eyes.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If I do that, I will hopefully be able to
figure out how to improve their lives
and make this village better and better!
As for you, Master Link... I hope that you
will come and visit us anytime you please.

---
label: talk0139
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}We must further our investigation of the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

They have become a symbol of sorts for
our village. As chief...I feel that they are
my responsibility.
That's why I've been borrowing books and
learning all I can from Tauro about {{color id="0"}}how to
decipher Zonai writing{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It is difficult, and truth be told, I hardly
understand a thing. Still, I must try.

---
label: talk0136
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I'm on my way to the lab, so sadly I don't
have time to show you around. I do hope
you'll stay as long as you like though.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Yes? Do you need...{{delay15}}


...


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}M-M-M...{{delay8}}MASTER LINK?!


I...I apologize... I was just so...surprised?
Yes. That. I was quite surprised.

To think that the subject of my prayers
would suddenly appear...

---
label: talk0142
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I was just this moment praying for your
safety during your perilous journeys,
Master Link.
Seeing your face when you found out that
the words "{{color id="0"}}Demon King{{color id="-1"}}" were written on
the stone slab... Oh, Master Link.
I knew at once that you must be carrying
the burden of a difficult quest upon your
broad...um, upon your shoulders.
All I can do is pray with all of my heart.
Please do take care of yourself.

label: talk0143

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Master Link... Could it be that you're
going somewhere?

---
label: talk0148
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There is the matter of the monsters that
appear when darkness falls. At night,
please try to stay close to the village.

---
label: talk0150
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oh, this won't do... I can't believe I
allowed myself to nod off like that.

I must keep studying if I have any hope of
becoming a great chief like Grandmother.

Master Link... Thank you for waking me.

---
label: talk0151
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Master Link, the hour is quite late. Please
don't worry about me. You should get
some rest.
I plan to head off to bed myself, after
studying for just a while longer...

---
label: talk0146
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Master Link? {{delay15}}Where are you off to?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It's nearly daybreak. Please take your
rest soon, Master Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}The Upheaval brought with it big changes
for our village.

Afterward, we learned that the Ring Ruins
were true rarities, with certain features
that are not present anywhere else.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Because of that, we now have tourists
coming to the village to view them.
Can you believe it?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_01"}}From now on, the Ring Ruins will be the
cornerstone of ensuring the vitality of
our village...
As the Kakariko Village chief, that is how I
think of them. A blessing born of tragedy.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I haven't yet learned anything about
Princess Zelda's whereabouts, so I'm not
sure I'll be of any help to you. Still...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination"}}Know that I will always support you. If you
ever need anything of this village, or if
anything transpires, we are here for you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The Zonai Ruins that Tauro and Calip
went to...

I must admit that I'm not too
knowledgeable about that place.
However, this is what I know...
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}There's an investigation site set up at the
{{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower in the Popla Foothills{{color id="-1"}},
{{color id="0"}}southwest {{color id="-1"}}of our village.
That's what they said, in any case.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination"}}I'm sure those two will be all right.
They are quite savvy.

I firmly believe...{{delay8}}that they will make a
huge discovery about the Demon King
and the {{color id="0"}}sage {{color id="-1"}}called{{color id="0"}} Mineru{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk0152
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} I neglected to tell you this
earlier, Master Link...

I have taken over the title of chief from
my grandmother.

Naturally, I still have a long way to go
before I truly earn that title, but I intend
to follow that path from first step to last.
