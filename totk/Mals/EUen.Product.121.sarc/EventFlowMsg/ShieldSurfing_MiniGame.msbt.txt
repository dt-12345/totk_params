{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's a simple sport. {{delay15}}We compete to see
how fast you can surf to the finish line.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}We don't race each other so much as we
race against the clock.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And just to check, you know how to shield
surf already, yeah?{{pageBreak}}There's nothing to it. {{delay15}}Make sure you have
your shield out, then jump onto it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}After that, it's cool if you get off the
shield sometimes, and it's totally legal
to accelerate and catch some air.{{pageBreak}}The way you reach the finish line doesn't
matter much, as long as you get there.
It's a pretty flexible sport that way.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's it. You've surpassed me. There's

That's not far off from my own best time.{{pageBreak}}Which is pretty incredible! {{delay15}}That's a run
you can be proud of.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You hit another skill plateau, I see. {{delay8}}You're

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}How about that? {{delay8}}You sure schooled us!{{delay8}}
We better step up our game, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The only ones who've recorded a time
this good so far are you, me, and a few

give us trouble, so personally, I put them
in their own separate category.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But that's neither here nor there. {{delay8}}It's time

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It is important to always try to beat your

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Not great, but not bad, I guess. {{delay15}}There's

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah. {{delay8}}You know, {{delay8}}you could say that your

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It takes experience to get good, no matter

more than just shield surfing!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're right. The only thing for it is to
practice, practice, practice.{{pageBreak}}I'm still not impressed with your time, but
you did make it all the way to the goal,
so you can have this shield as a reward.

I'm sure you can do better than that on
this one.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do the work to develop your surfing style,
and better times will follow naturally!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Maybe it would be a good idea to go back

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Let's see... {{delay15}}What other advice can I
give you?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know where Russ stands during
a run? {{delay8}}That spot a little ways down the
slope from here?{{pageBreak}}If you hang a left there and go a ways off
course, then down into the ravine, you'll
come to the {{color id="0"}}cave where I ran into trouble{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}All my instincts as a veteran shield surfer
tell me that if you could somehow pass
through that {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}, then surely...

label: Talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Actually, no. Forget I said that.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}A good teacher wouldn't lead her devoted
students anywhere that she herself ended
up stuck.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That aside! {{delay15}}I have a commemorative
shield for you. {{delay8}}Use this to practice the
normal way—no risky cave shortcuts!

But I'm not sure where you can take it
from there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}To do any better, you'd need to turn the
fundamental idea of shield surfing on
its head...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You mean like surfing on something other

better than that?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hey, man, shield surfing is all about new

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Whatever these two knuckleheads say,{{delay8}}
assembling a contraption to use during a

along the way?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I thought I remembered you having space
in your pouch before the run, but now it
seems like you don't.{{pageBreak}}I wouldn't feel great about taking your
money again for another lesson until you
