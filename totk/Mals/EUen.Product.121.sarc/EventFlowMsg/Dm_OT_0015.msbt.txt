It is good to see you...

Princess Zelda of Hyrule.

And Link, keeper of the Master Sword.

Your blade has been fully restored.

label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_004_b

Go on then, Link. Draw it once more.

Great Deku Tree, thank you so much.

label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_006_b

Ha ha ha... There is no need for thanks. I merely
watched over its renewal.

It is amazing that a sword can heal itself, no matter
how badly damaged it becomes...

---
label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_008_b
---
It can do more than heal.

label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_009_b

The sword will continue to gain strength if bathed in
sacred power. The stronger that power, the more
powerful the sword becomes.

label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_010_b
---
The potential of this fabled blade may well be limitless.
Truly the work of a goddess.

label: Dm_OT_0015_Text_011_b
---
A sword...that grows ever stronger.

The Master Sword.
