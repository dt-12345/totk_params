A secret treasure...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link! Your timing is as impeccable
as ever, my friend!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I have not discovered any new hints about
your princess, I fear. However... I have
stumbled across something fascinating.
As I was diligently organizing texts
relating to the royal family, I came
across one of particular interest.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The content regarded a secret treasure,
and at once I thought of you. This seems
just your sort of thing! So? Intrigued?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah! Link!{{delay8}} Thank you for stopping by,
my friend!{{delay15}} Now, about the search for
Princess Zelda...
I have been turning the domain inside out
trying to find a clue for you.{{delay8}} Sadly, I fear
I have not yet found a thing.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If that is not what brought you here, are
you, by chance, intrigued by the text I
found regarding a {{color id="0"}}secret treasure{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So! I take it you are intrigued by the text
I stumbled across regarding a {{color id="0"}}secret
treasure{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay15}} Is that so?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link! Always a pleasure.


My apologies, but I fear I am still in the
process of hunting for clues about
the fifth sage.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}However, I do have something else to
report.{{delay8}} I found some interesting text
in books relating to the Zora royal family.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It is about nothing short of a {{color id="0"}}secret
treasure{{color id="-1"}}! How marvelous, yes? Knowing
you, I take it you are intrigued?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link!{{delay8}} Thank you for coming to see me.{{delay15}}
Now, about the fifth sage...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I fear there is not a hint to be found
in Zora's Domain thus far, {{delay8}}so the
investigation is at a standstill.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! Or perhaps you are here due to your
intolerable curiosity about the text I
mentioned regarding a {{color id="0"}}secret treasure{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link!{{delay8}} Thank you for coming to see me.{{pageBreak}}How goes your quest to locate Mineru?{{delay8}}
The fifth sage?{{delay15}} If there is any way I can be
of assistance, do not hesitate to ask!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! Or perhaps you are here due to your

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}You never disappoint, do you? Yes,
this is just what I expected of my
dearest companion!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}In that case, I shall let you in on the
mystery. There was a passage in the text
I mentioned that went as follows...
{{anim type="Think_00"}}"The great fish. The eternal guardian.{{delay8}}
A secret treasure awaits just beneath
the stony form of its statue.
"Below the long bridge that reaches for
the statue, leave your fears behind. {{delay8}}Pass
beneath two waterfalls to find your prize."
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}So! What do you make of it? It is like a
good, old-fashioned treasure hunt,
is it not?
That said, it was a very old book, so it is
questionable whether that {{color id="0"}}secret treasure{{color id="-1"}}
is still there, or ever was.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}However, if there is truth in those ancient
words, this treasure may be of use to you.{{delay15}}
If you see fit, I encourage you to seek it!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I see...{{delay8}} Well, I am sure you have your
reasons! If you ever feel so inclined,
I would be happy to share my findings.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, right!{{delay15}} This is perhaps a tad off topic,
however...{{pageBreak}}I chanced upon a fascinating passage in
some texts relating to the Zora royal
family.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It seems to hint at a secret treasure,
and adventurer that you are, I thought
you might be interested. So? Intrigued?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}About the fifth sage...{{delay8}} I am investigating
some ancient texts of the domain to see if
I can find any clues.
That said, I am quite curious about this
alleged {{color id="0"}}secret treasure{{color id="-1"}} written of in those
texts about the Zora royal family.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}About Mineru, the fifth sage...{{delay15}} I dearly
hope your investigations turn up a clue
to defeating the Demon King, my friend.
That said, I am quite curious about this
alleged {{color id="0"}}secret treasure{{color id="-1"}} written of in those

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Our final battle with the Demon King is
fast approaching.{{delay15}} We must prepare for
this confrontation with utmost vigilance.
Yet, I must admit I am still curious about
that {{color id="0"}}secret treasure {{color id="-1"}}I read of in those
texts about the Zora royal family...

I would dare to venture, {{delay8}}is to determine
what "the great fish" is referring to.
