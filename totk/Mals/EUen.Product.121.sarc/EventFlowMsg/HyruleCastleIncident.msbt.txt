{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Just like I thought, the weapons here have

swords, spears, claymores, you name
it—suddenly {{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}.
I've explored many regions in search of
weapons that might still be intact.

I found none. At this point, I'd be

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}There was some commotion up above just

Yeah, me and a few others had the

the princess.
We were hoping to help, anyway...


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But the {{color id="0"}}captain{{color id="-1"}} is way up {{color id="0"}}on top of the
gatehouse{{color id="-1"}} there. It doesn't look like he's
coming down anytime soon.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We just showed up without being asked.
So, uh, best to stay out of the way until
we can help somehow.

---
label: talk_1_66

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A few of us came to pitch in with finding
Princess Zelda. We all owe her in some

Hopefully the {{color id="0"}}captain{{color id="-1"}} comes down from
the{{color id="0"}} gatehouse{{color id="-1"}} to put us to work. Glad to
stay out of the way until then.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll do whatever I can to help out in the

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If he doesn't come down from the

to the {{color id="0"}}captain{{color id="-1"}} myself. Hmmm...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I hear he's pretty busy. I'd probably be

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Good. That {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} is crucial to our search.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The strange {{color id="0"}}phenomena {{color id="-1"}}are concentrated

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious"}}I can't say for certain, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hey, Doc... I don't know if this is helpful,

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, and before I forget, Link.


We've asked the Lucky Clover Gazette to
help us in the search for Princess Zelda.

There's nobody who knows more about
the goings-on in Hyrule than them.

You can find them {{color id="0"}}near the entrance to
Rito Village{{color id="-1"}}.

If you do go there, you should speak with
the editor. I'm sure she could help out in
some way too.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll be here, directing a variety of

And now we have news about the
princess. There's some relief in that,
at least.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}So...{{delay8}} In the ancient past, Princess Zelda
worked to restore the decayed Master
Sword and return it to your hand.
Trusting that you would defeat the
Demon King in the present day.

She did so much, all on her own...


{{delay15}}...

---
label: talk152
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious"}}The restored Master Sword is somewhere
in this era. I'm sure of it.

To start, you should probably talk to the
Deku Tree about it, as Mineru advised.

---
label: talk154
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The Deku Tree is in the center of Great
Hyrule Forest to the north of here.

Princess Zelda left us with her final wish.
It's up to us now.

---
label: talk155
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Talk to the Deku Tree—he may have a
lead. You have to find the Master Sword!

---
label: talk146
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}The{{delay15}} Master Sword was restored, you say?{{delay15}}


When were you planning on telling me?!


And it was found on the head of a white
dragon, of all places?{{delay8}} That's...hard
to believe...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}However...{{delay15}}

---
label: talk148
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_00"}}This was Princess Zelda's wish. One she
believed in so strongly that she gave her
life to see it through. For us...
Thank you for finding the sword,{{delay15}} Link.

---
label: talk149
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I have to say.

---
label: talk156
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}You really don't look quite yourself unless
you've got the Master Sword at your side.

---
label: talk90
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahGreeting_00"}}Now then, it seems you have all you need.
You're prepared to face our enemy.

---
label: talk87
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Linky! Welcome back.


And the Master Sword?{{delay15}} Any luck?{{delay15}}


From the look on your face, I can see
that's a no.

---
label: talk92
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_00"}}All that's left now is to find the
Master Sword.

---
label: talk80
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}According to the sage Mineru...


Princess Zelda{{delay8}} said to ask the Great
Deku Tree about the Master Sword.

You'll find him at the center of Great
Hyrule Forest to the north of here.

The Master Sword is the key to defeating
the Demon King. You need to do whatever
it takes to find it, Linky.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Princess Zelda entrusted us with her
final wishes.

We can't let them come to nothing.

---
label: talk88
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?{{delay15}} You found a clue about the fifth
sage at Kakariko Village!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So, the sage's name is {{color id="0"}}Mineru{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}} And there
are clues at the Zonai Ruins in Faron...{{delay15}}
I see.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Linky!{{delay8}} Fantastic work!{{delay8}} This is a
huge development.

I'm sure you'll find the {{color id="0"}}sage Mineru{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: talk102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?{{delay15}} You found the fifth sage?!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And her name is {{color id="0"}}Mineru{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}} But she only
exists as a spirit now...{{delay15}} I see.{{delay15}}

Of all the stories you've told, this one has
to be the most outlandish.{{delay15}} But I guess I've
got no choice but to believe you.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Linky.{{delay8}} Fantastic work!{{delay8}}


This is HUGE. The {{color id="0"}}sage Mineru{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} You
have to bring her with you!

---
label: talk82
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, this really is wonderful news. The
Sage of Spirit, who fought alongside the
ancestors, is now here to help.
That means you're well supported in the
fight against the Demon King.

---
label: talk91
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Linky, welcome back.


Did you find out where the
Master Sword is?

---
label: talk93
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Linky, welcome ba—{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Hang on. That looks an awful lot like...{{delay15}}


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Is that the Master Sword?!{{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}

---
label: talk83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You found the Master Sword,{{delay8}} did you?{{delay15}}


And it was found on the head of a white
dragon, of all places?{{delay8}} That's...hard
to believe...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}However...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}However...{{delay15}}

---
label: New01_01_talk001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We need to determine where the
Demon King is lurking.

It seems unlikely he'd still be in
Hyrule Castle.

I can't think of any place he'd be here on
the surface.{{delay15}} That must mean...{{delay15}}

---
label: New01_01_talk008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}That's it! The Depths!{{delay15}}

---
label: New01_01_talk009
---
Well? Wouldn't you say there's a high
probability {{delay8}}that he's in the Depths?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do what you think best, of course, but my
suggestion is to ask Josha for any info she
may have.
She's enthusiastic about investigating the
Depths, so I'm sure she'd be happy to
help out.

---
label: New01_01_talk003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Linky, welcome back. So? Any news from
the Depths?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}At this point, you've gathered the five
sages together and returned the
Master Sword to your side.
All we have to do now is locate the
Demon King.

Princess Zelda entrusted her final wishes
to us. We can't let them amount
to nothing.
We have to find him, and quickly.

---
label: New01_01_talk006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry.{{delay8}} Let me gather my thoughts here.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I can't think of anywhere on the surface
he might be, but the Depths...that
seems likely.
Although we can't be too certain...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll leave it to you to head up the search.


That said, if you're investigating the
Depths, ask Josha for help.

I'm sure she'll have useful information
for you.

---
label: New01_01_talk007

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link, the rest is up to you.

---
label: New01_02_talk001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Whoa... {{delay8}}So the Demon King is in the{{color id="0"}}
deepest reaches of the Depths{{color id="-1"}}...
Far {{color id="0"}}beneath Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}As usual, you're one step ahead
of me, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}And you look so calm and collected,
despite what you were up against.

You navigated the Depths, which are
incredibly dangerous and home to all
sorts of nasty creatures...
Not to mention all the gloom down
there. It must have been a very
challenging investigation.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And yet, you did it...{{delay30}}

---
label: New01_02_talk011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Thank you, Link.{{delay15}} So much.

---
label: New01_02_talk010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Josha turned out to be pretty
capable, eh?

That kid was working tirelessly to gather
information. She wanted to be of use
to you.
Make sure you let her know her help was
valuable, yeah?

---
label: New01_02_talk003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_01"}}With this, preparations are complete.{{delay8}} Now
our target is the {{color id="0"}}deepest reaches of
the Depths{{color id="-1"}}—beneath {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Of course, I'll let all of the sages know

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}By the way, where are your clothes?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}By the way, is that the tunic the

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}By the way,{{delay8}} it appears you've been

some insider information from you now.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}From the looks of it,{{delay8}} you've finished
helping out Traysi.

Whenever I read a story in the newspaper

part to play in solving it.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Because of you, all those falsehoods
about the princess were put to an end.
Thank you.
