{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What book should I pick today?

---
label: talk129
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}They all look pretty interesting, so it's
tough to decide.

---
label: near02
---
Hmm. They all look neat...

---
label: talk114
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Which one do I read today? {{delay8}}Hmm...{{pageBreak}}Oh, this "History of the Sheikah Tribe"
book looks good. {{delay15}}Let's see...{{delay8}} Here we go.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"The Sheikah tribe was known for their
wisdom, as expressed by their love for
learning and technology.{{pageBreak}}"That technology was instrumental in
sealing away the Calamity of 10,000
years ago.{{pageBreak}}"However, their knowledge was also seen
as a threat to the security of the kingdom,
and they were exiled.{{pageBreak}}"Eventually, the Sheikah who harbored
grudges against the kingdom gathered to
form the Yiga Clan.{{pageBreak}}"To this day, they work from the shadows
to destroy the kingdom."{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Whoa! Aren't the Sheikah tribe those
people in Kakariko Village to the
northwest of here?{{pageBreak}}They all seem like good folks. I didn't
know there was an evil version of them
too. {{delay15}}Hm?

---
label: talk134
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Which one do I read today? {{delay8}}Hmm...{{pageBreak}}{{delay15}}Oooh, there's one called "The Champions
and Their Divine Beasts." {{delay15}}Let's see...{{delay8}}
Here we go.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"Divine Beasts were mechanical
weapons built 10,000 years ago to
fight the Calamity.{{pageBreak}}"They were the size of mountains and
incredibly strong, meaning that not just
anyone was allowed to handle them.{{pageBreak}}"Only the Champions—specially chosen
representatives of each people—were
permitted to control them.{{pageBreak}}"By their efforts was the Calamity
stopped.{{pageBreak}}"When the Calamity returned as foretold
100 years ago, the Divine Beasts were
seen once again.{{pageBreak}}"A new set of Champions came forward to
use them.{{pageBreak}}"Unfortunately, the Calamity seized
control of the Divine Beasts, and the new
Champions lost their lives in the process."{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ouch...{{delay8}}that's a pretty sad story.{{pageBreak}}But when I was little, I heard the Divine
Beasts went back into action, so I bet the
Champions' souls are at peace. Hm?
