{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}This is a real pile of garbage, isn't it?{{delay15}}
Hard not to be upset at the sight.

I spotted it during my travels, and the
sight bothered me so much, I couldn't
help stopping to clean it up.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I believe that we travelers have a duty to
protect the beauty of nature and not sully
it with trash!{{delay15}}
Yep. When I leave a place, I want it to be
cleaner than when I arrived.

That's why I even travel with a broom,
as you can see.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Unfortunately, these tumbleweeds keep
rolling in. There's just no end to it.
I can't keep up!{{delay15}}
I do want to leave this place cleaner
than when I arrived, so I can't just
overlook all of this.{{delay15}}
I think I could make progress here
if only these tumbleweeds didn't
keep tumbling in...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The tumbleweeds really are a nuisance...


If I sweep them away, they come right
back. I don't have any idea what I can
do to clean it all up.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The tumbleweeds kept rolling up and
rolling up... I got tired trying to stay on
top of all of them.{{delay15}}
I could try again tomorrow.{{delay15}} But I want to
sweep away some of them, at least...

*sigh* {{delay15}}I just wish there was a way to
get rid of them all...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I could clean up all the tumbleweeds,
then I could clean up everything else,
piece by piece.{{delay15}}
I'm going to need to work at it until it's
all done, no matter what.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! The tumbleweeds are gone!

label: Report_Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! Did you clean them all up?


There were so many. Wasn't that a lot of
work? Thank you so much.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Please, take this. It's something special
I found while I was cleaning.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! You cleaned them all up?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I spotted them during my travels, and the

help stopping to sweep up.
I believe that we travelers have a duty
to leave no trash behind as we go—we
should protect the beauty of nature.{{delay15}}
For me, that means leaving a place
cleaner than when I arrived.

That's why I even travel with a broom,
as you can see.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But in all my travels, I've never had
someone do my cleaning for me!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Please, take this. It's something special
I found while I was sweeping.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh? Your pouch is full.


I want to give you a shield, but you've got
to make some space in there first!

label: Report_Talk_04

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}There you are! This is the reward I meant
to give you before.

Can you believe I found this while
I was cleaning?

label: Report_Talk_02

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Now that all of the tumbleweeds are
gone, I can handle cleaning up the rest
of this by myself. Leave it to me!
