{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, good morning.


I woke up early today so that I could get
as much cleaning done as possible.

---
label: Greeting_Noon
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hello.


I really appreciate the bright sun during
the day—it makes it easy to spot every
last little thing that needs cleaning!

---
label: Greeting_Night
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, good evening.


The sun is setting, and with it goes my
drive to clean, mainly because it's so hard
to see without the sun blazing overhead.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}Oops, sorry! I nodded off there for
a minute.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Cleaning up this mountain of garbage is
a daunting task...

But I enjoy it! I just picture how it'll
look when I'm done and that keeps
me motivated!

label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Every little bit of progress I make is
one step closer to this place finally
being clean!
I actually enjoy cleaning, so I think of this
as training and refining my skills!

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Oh, that reminds me—I found something
pretty that I'd like you to have.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If I can make this place sparkle like a
gem, that'll bring me all the joy I need.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The mountain of garbage is a formidable
foe. I'm taking a little break now, but I'll
be right back at it in the morning.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I'm gonna rest for just a little bit, then
I'll keep working.

Honestly, cleaning is something of a
passion of mine. I can't wait until morning
comes and I can get back to it!

Got to work hard...

Before it gets dark...

Just a little more...

Zzz... Zzz...
