{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Well, if it isn't Link!

---
label: Talk1043

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You came to our aid again! I'm so happy
and also incredibly grateful.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}As you can see, we're in the midst of
preparing to attack the monsters who've
dug in up ahead. They must be wiped out!
Just like last time, {{color id="0"}}we'll approach{{color id="-1"}} the
fiends' stronghold first, then {{color id="0"}}launch our
attack {{color id="-1"}}when the moment is right.
If you're so inclined, Link, perhaps we can
fight together once again and drive out
those hideous monsters!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You came to our aid again! I'm so happy
and also incredibly grateful.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You probably noticed that we're in the
middle of a mission.

As leader of this squad, it pains me that
I have to stay here and prepare a backup
plan rather than join the fight.
Link, if you could assist my squad, I'm
certain it would raise their morale.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Please, join this fight. Help us drive out
those repulsive monsters!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You came to our aid once again! I'm so
happy and also incredibly grateful.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But I hate to say it...{{delay15}}you're too late.{{pageBreak}}My squad fought bravely only to have the
monsters turn the tables on them.

I'm desperate to aid my compatriots but
can't risk being taken down myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If only {{color id="0"}}the monsters could be defeated{{color id="-1"}}
somehow...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You came to our aid once again! I'm so
happy and beyond grateful.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}But, well, it looks like the fight is
already over.

It's so strange, I was sure there was
going to be a terrible horde of monsters
here at Akkala Span.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}The rain should make it {{color id="0"}}more difficult for
the enemy to hear our footsteps{{color id="-1"}}. I just
wish I could fight beside you.

label: Talk_027

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Watch out for the {{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}}. I recommend 
you remove all {{color id="0"}}metal equipment{{color id="-1"}}. It's safer
that way.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ah, Link! {{delay8}}Good thing you were here!
Once again, I'm grateful for your help.

If you don't mind, could I have a moment
of your time?

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I can't thank you enough for doing so
much on our behalf!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Sometimes it feels like you're the real
monster-control crew. I am sorry if this
has been a burden for you.

label: Talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Once again you showed up out of
nowhere and helped us clean up a
mess of monsters.
In fact, you did most of the work, so I'm
especially grateful.

---
label: Talk1038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Here, please take this token of my
appreciation for everything you've done.

---
label: Talk1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Speaking of which, I received word
from headquarters.{{pageBreak}}It seems we're not the only squad of the
monster-control crew you've saved, Link.

I'm pleased to deliver this gift from
headquarters as a sign of our gratitude.
I hope it adds some color to your travels.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm thinking of giving the team a bit of
a break.

The {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}... I'm sure you've
noticed it.

When the sky turns crimson, the monsters
rise up from the depths of the underworld.

We should all rest when we can so
we have the energy to fight these
endless battles.
Link, if you were by our side, I'm sure
we'd be safe... But I probably shouldn't
burden you like that.

---
label: Talk1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}With that, it's time for me to go.{{delay15}}
I hope we meet on the battlefield
again someday.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It looks like the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} has
resurrected the monsters on the
Akkala Span.
We must reclaim the bridge as quickly
as possible. We owe it to the people.
They're terrified.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The monster-control crew will mount an
all-out {{color id="0"}}attack {{color id="-1"}}on the beasts once we're
able to {{color id="0"}}move in{{color id="-1"}} on this side of the bridge.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}We must bring peace back to the Akkala
region.{{delay8}} Any help you can give us will be
most welcome, Link!

label: Talk1026

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Well, well! If it isn't Link! {{delay15}}Have you come
to fight beside us again?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Because of the {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}}, the
monsters have got their claws on
the Akkala Span again.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}But if you lead the charge, Link,{{delay8}} we'll
follow without hesitation, and those
vermin will tremble at the sight of us!
Please, let's join forces again and bring
peace back to this land!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Well, well, if it isn't Link!{{delay8}} You came to
fight beside us again!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}blood moon{{color id="-1"}} resurrected the
monsters, and now they've got their
claws on the Akkala Span once again.
My division mounted a respectable
attack against them, but we were
outmaneuvered...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm desperate to rescue them, but I can't
until the {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}are wiped out.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I have to thank you again for doing so

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Sometimes it seems like you're the real

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}One day, the {{color id="0"}}blood moon {{color id="-1"}}will disappear.


But until that day comes, we must keep
fighting.{{delay8}} Peace in Hyrule depends on it.

If you were to join us, Link, I'm sure we'd
be all right. But I shouldn't burden you
with that.
