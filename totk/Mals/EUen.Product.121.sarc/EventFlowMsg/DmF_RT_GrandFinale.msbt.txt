{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You guys! You did it!

label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_002
---
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Yeah! Turns out it was easy once we
started working together!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}{{playSound id="60" otherArg="0x0000"}}Hm.

This was no small feat.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I still can't believe the Stormwind Ark
from the children's song was real.

You could've knocked me over with
a feather!

{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}For a job well done, Tulin.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Wait, what?! This bow meant so much to
you...and now you're giving it to me?

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_010

{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It was always my intention to give it to
you once you came of age as a warrior.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hey, Link? {{delay8}}That woman in the vision my
ancestor showed us...didn't she look just
like Princess Zelda to you?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Do you think that was the real princess?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I mean...it seemed like a long, long
time ago...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}There's still a bunch of unanswered
questions.

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}One thing's still bothering me, Link...

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Y'know that woman who called herself the
Sage of Time? From the vision we got
after I touched the secret stone?

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}Not only did she look real familiar, she
even said your name!

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Do you think that really was Princess
Zelda? And if it was...

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Did the princess go way, way back to the
time of my ancestors?{{pageBreak}}I'm not the only one who's seen her,
though. There've been sightings of the
princess in other regions too.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... There's still so many questions.

label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}She didn't just look a lot like Princess
Zelda—I'd recognize her anywhere, and
that was definitely her!

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}So how come some people claim they've
seen the princess? I think we need to
keep investigating.

{{anim type="TuliHowl_00"}}I know some people say they've seen
the princess doing bad stuff, but that
can't be right!

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_029

{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}I want to get to the bottom of this.

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I gotta know more about the figure we
saw on the Stormwind Ark, so I'm gonna
go look into it personally.

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_030

Next time you see me, I'll have more
information about Princess Zelda.
So check in with me sometime, OK?!

---
label: DmF_RT_GrandFinale_032

{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="TuliPositive_00"}}And remember—with my sage's power,
the two of us can keep working together
no matter what!
