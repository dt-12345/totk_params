{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh, it's you. Your arrival is sure to cause
a bit of a stir, hm?

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Sure enough, you stirred things up
around here.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oho! But you probably needed something,
didn't you?

Well, if this is your first visit, go talk to
that {{color id="0"}}soldier{{color id="-1"}} in the center of our little fort.

---
label: Talk_24

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I think you've caused quite a stir since
your arrival here...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha! People do fuss, don't they?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If this is your first visit, talk to that
{{color id="0"}}soldier{{color id="-1"}} in the center of our little fort.
Or were you hoping to {{color id="0"}}register a horse{{color id="-1"}}?
We're still getting things together on that
front, so I'm afraid you'll have to hold
your horses a while longer. Heh.

---
label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm sorry. {{delay15}}If you want to {{color id="0"}}register a horse{{color id="-1"}},
you'll have to wait a while longer.

We're still getting set up around here.

Register a horse?

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you {{color id="0"}}register{{color id="-1"}} a wild horse as your own,
you can call that horse to you at a stable
whenever you please.
At bigger roadside stables, not only can
you register horses but you can also stay
the night.
We didn't have room to build something{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
that fancy here, {{delay8}}but I did want a place
I could take care of horses properly.
Which is why Karson from Hudson
Construction is planning to build us
a {{color id="0"}}mini stable{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Once it's finished, you'll be able to
register, board, and take out horses just
like you would at any other stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I used to work at Rito Stable in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
Had a good job taking care of horses.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}But the cold there kept getting colder,
and business got slower. In time, we had
to close.
Last I heard, the place had been bought
out by the {{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Just when I was feeling adrift, {{delay8}}Purah
reached out to me about managing the
horses here at Lookout Landing...
And before I knew it, here I was.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}We wouldn't have been able to build
such a handsome {{color id="0"}}mini stable {{color id="-1"}}without

I'll work hard to make sure it was worth
the wait.

---
label: Talk_28

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Between constructing the mini stable and

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah,{{delay8}} my apologies!{{delay8}} I still have to give you

I'm familiar.

label: Talk_96

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When a member uses a service at a stable

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, you're familiar? {{delay8}}Saves me an

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well then, as a reward for using the

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm going to add {{color id="0"}}one point{{color id="-1"}} to your

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'll be adding {{color id="0"}}two points{{color id="-1"}} to your

label: Talk_101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}You'll earn points for using a stable for
the first time, registering a horse, lodging

You can earn wonderful {{color id="0"}}rewards{{color id="-1"}} based

I'd love to tell you all about them, but...
Well, we mini stables don't have any

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I'm running this mini stable alone, so I

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We only register, board, and bring out
horses here.

---
label: Talk_107

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm afraid you can't exchange points for
{{color id="0"}}rewards{{color id="-1"}} here either. You'll have to head
to a {{color id="0"}}stable {{color id="-1"}}for that.

label: Talk_77

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hoh ho, I'll happily tell you as many

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}With that, the preparations are complete.
Let's register your new horse, shall we?

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Oh, in that case...{{delay8}} I've canceled the
registration of the new horse. It's good
to cherish the horses you have.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you save up your Pony Points, you'll be
able to increase the number of horses we
can take care of for you.
So the Stable Association looks forward to
your continued patronage!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All righty, let's get this lovely little
horse registered.

Your horse is your partner through thick
and thin. Your pal-omino, as it were.{{delay8}}
What will you call your new friend here?

---
label: Talk_90
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, what name are you thinking of using
to register this little one?

Spot's the name I chose way back when...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But this is your horse now, Link. You're
welcome to pick whatever name feels
right to you.

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now, Link, please give your horse a na—


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait. {{delay8}}Now hold on just a minute here...


Th-{{delay8}}this horse... Could it be?!{{delay15}} That's the
legendary {{color id="0"}}Epona {{color id="-1"}}we're looking at!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This here is a very special horse. {{delay8}}It just
wouldn't be right to try to give her a
different name.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}With that said, shall we register her under
the name "{{color id="0"}}Epona{{color id="-1"}}"?

---
label: 0021
---
Change it.

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I understand your feelings, Link,
I really do.

But I would get an earful from the
Stable Association if I even tried to
change a legendary horse's name.
Could you register her with the
name "{{color id="0"}}Epona{{color id="-1"}}"?

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Please give this little one a fitting name.

---
label: Talk_52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Are you all right with the name
{{color id="0"}}{{selectedHorseName}}{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Name registration complete. {{delay15}}Do you plan
on taking the horse with you?

---
label: 0022
---
I'll take it with me.

---
label: 0023
---
Board it.

---
label: Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Understood. {{delay8}}We'll take good care of this
little one.

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thank you for waiting. {{delay8}}The horse is all
yours, Link.

---
label: Talk_113
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thank you for waiting.{{delay8}} Give that horse
lots of love for me, will you?

---
label: Talk_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}On that note...{{delay15}}how much do you know
about {{color id="0"}}whistling{{color id="-1"}}?

Horses will always come to their owners
when they whistle. {{delay8}}If you ever lose sight
of your horse, give {{color id="0"}}whistling{{color id="-1"}} a try!

---
label: Talk_59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That said, if you and your horse are too
far apart, it won't be able to hear you. Be
sure to keep that in mind!

label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Everyone's in a commotion here at
Lookout Landing too. Lots of talk about
the Demon King reviving and the like...
The horses must've picked up on the fuss,{{delay8}}
'cause they're all in a tizzy... 

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Have you already been to
{{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable{{color id="-1"}}?

Just follow the road from Lookout
Landing's {{color id="0"}}west gate{{color id="-1"}}. You can't miss it.

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Have you been to {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}}
I hear there's a Great Fairy Fountain
right nearby...
If you leave out of Lookout Landing's {{color id="0"}}east
gate{{color id="-1"}}, you'll find it on the way to {{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Have you visited {{color id="0"}}Wetland Stable{{color id="-1"}}, by
any chance? {{delay8}}It's on the riverside in
{{color id="0"}}Lanayru{{color id="-1"}}, off to the east.
Might be nice to float down the river
on a clear day...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ever been to the stable at the base of the
{{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}It's in Necluda, a region
that makes up most of the southeast.
Not a bad place to stop if you're on your
way to {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} or {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ah... Any chance you're familiar with
{{color id="0"}}Outskirt Stable{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}It's on the road to the
Gerudo region in the southwest.
That area is known for its harsh climate,{{delay8}}
so taking a rest at the stable might help
you beat the heat!

---
label: Talk_87
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Stop in anytime. {{delay8}}The horses and I will be
waiting for you.

Horses sure are cute...

This is a fine, little stable.

I really do miss Rito Stable.
