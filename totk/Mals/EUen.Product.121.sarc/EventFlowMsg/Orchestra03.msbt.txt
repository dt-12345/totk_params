they want all of us musicians back?
That's great!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But...{{delay15}}first I have something to do here.


I can't go back to the Stable Trotters
until I take care of it.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Come on. Let's move this down there

what happened here.

---
label: Talk_1010

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}What happened...{{delay8}}not that you probably
haven't heard already...{{delay8}}is that there was
a fire in the field.
Yeah, right on this spot.{{delay8}} This burned
patch around us. There were some
flowers here before.
It was all my fault.{{delay8}} An accident, but still
my fault.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You see, I have a friend who lives at this
stable. Her name's Haite.{{delay8}} Maybe you've
met her?{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}She's been asking people if she could see
a "glowing tree." It's just something from
a picture book.
You know...{{delay8}}it's not real. But she really,
really wishes it was. I promised her that
I'd show her one!
Not my brightest idea,{{delay8}} uh,{{delay8}} given they
don't exist. And then I was stuck.

So...I thought I'd use just a little tree...
and a little fire...and make a "glowing
tree." Really quick, that's all.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}That's how things got burned here, but I
was only thinking of my promise to Haite.

So, now I'm collecting fireflies.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I need only {{color id="0"}}10{{color id="-1"}} more {{color id="0"}}sunset fireflies{{color id="-1"}}, and
then I'll have enough to make a whole

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}They glow {{color id="0"}}after night falls{{color id="-1"}}, so
they aren't hard to spot.

I haven't seen any around the

I've definitely heard that there are a lot
around the {{color id="0"}}deep forest to the north{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}But which way is north from here?{{delay8}} Maps
aren't really my specialty.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, about those fireflies! They'll fly away
if they hear you, so sneak up to them.

Finding them isn't the hard part. I'm
bad at being quiet!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}I think it's hard to find any

for you.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I can make the glowiest of glowing trees.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Um...{{delay8}}while you're helping, can you do
me one more favor?

glowing. So I'd like you to {{color id="0"}}bring{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Haite{{color id="-1"}} to

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I've figured it out.{{delay8}} I'm going back to
the {{color id="0"}}Stable Trotters{{color id="-1"}}!

I'll get better and better at playing my
flute. More fun, more amazing! {{delay8}}Because

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The Stable Trotters troupe performs music

played flute in the troupe.

But I gave all that up...
