{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, didn't see you there. I've got {{color id="0"}}fireproof
lizards{{color id="-1"}} on the brain.

So, uh...did you need something?
I'm kinda busy.

label: talk05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah. This is a good spot, since it's close
to their {{color id="0"}}burrow{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I found it first.{{pageBreak}}If you want to catch{{color id="0"}} fireproof lizards{{color id="-1"}},
maybe do it elsewhere?

Fireproof lizards?

---
label: talk01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Fireproof lizards are a key ingredient for
{{color id="0"}}fireproof elixirs{{color id="-1"}}, you see.

Fireproof equipment is so pricey that
I can't afford it, but fireproof lizards?
They don't cost a thing.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It seems like their {{color id="0"}}burrow {{color id="-1"}}is {{color id="0"}}inside the
cave{{color id="-1"}}, and that's where I'd like to get to.

But the cave is sweltering hot. A Hylian
like you or me wouldn't last long without 
appropriate defenses.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, do me a favor, buddy. If you're after
the lizards too, please go catch them
somewhere else.
They're always on high alert, and they're
{{color id="0"}}really sensitive to footsteps{{color id="-1"}}.

label: talk10

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wish I had fireproof gear like you
do, buddy.

But it's out of my price range...


If you're wondering, I'm out here catching
fireproof lizards so I can brew a{{color id="0"}} fireproof
elixir {{color id="-1"}}or two.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've figured out that their {{color id="0"}}burrow {{color id="-1"}}is {{color id="0"}}inside
the cave{{color id="-1"}}, so I want to get in there and get
to work.
Problem is, the cave is absolutely
sweltering, and a Hylian like me
wouldn't last long in there.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Even so...if you're after fireproof
lizards, please do me a favor and go
catch elsewhere.
These lizards are always on high alert and
are {{color id="0"}}really sensitive to footsteps{{color id="-1"}}, so the
less feet there are here, the better.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Fireproof gear is way out of my
price range...

But it's basically free to catch a wild
fireproof lizard to make it into a
{{color id="0"}}fireproof elixir{{color id="-1"}}.
So I'm taking extra care and making sure
my {{color id="0"}}footsteps don't make noise {{color id="-1"}}so I go
home with a good haul today.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ideally, I'd root around their burrow {{color id="0"}}inside
of the cave{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But without any fireproof gear, it's way
too hot for Hylians like us to last long
in there.
