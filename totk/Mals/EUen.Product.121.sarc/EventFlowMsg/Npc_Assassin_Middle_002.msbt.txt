{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Who are you? Our backup?


Good. Link let the tailor who made our
outfits escape, so go catch us a new one.

You can recognize tailors by their {{color id="0"}}gaudy
outfits{{color id="-1"}}. If you see one—doesn't matter
who—you bring them back here.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}They don't have much sense, but they do
know their clothes.

They probably even know about {{color id="0"}}the Great
Bandit Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s clothing collection. I hear
it was legendary. To, uh, tailors.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}WHOA! You can't just let info that slip to
some guy we don't even know!

Listen, those tailors are always wandering
the {{color id="0"}}roads {{color id="-1"}}without a care in the world. If
we need to grab one, then I'll go do it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You want to help us out that badly?


Then go catch us a new tailor to make our
clothes. Link let ours get away.

You can recognize tailors by their {{color id="0"}}gaudy
outfits{{color id="-1"}}. It doesn't matter who you find,
just get us one.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Those guys know {{color id="0"}}clothes{{color id="-1"}} so well, they
could probably tell you every piece of the{{color id="0"}}
Great Bandit Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s legendary collection.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You—you're Link!


You got guts to show your face around
here, but you're not getting out alive!{{playSound id="90" otherArg="0x0000"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The spikes are all in place.


But do we really need all this? It's not
like anybody ever comes through here.

label: Talk_201

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}We're not on the lookout for "anybody,"
we're on the lookout for Link!

That guy's trouble, and he's got a bad
habit of showing up where you least
expect him. We can never be too careful!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We just received our regular memo
from the hideout—a {{color id="0"}}journal {{color id="-1"}}containing
{{color id="0"}}confidential information{{color id="-1"}}.
It's for Yiga eyes only. We cannot allow it
to fall into enemy hands.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You better not have skimped on the
spikes this time!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}I'm sorry, OK? Next time, I'll do it right.
I'll set the traps up so they'll explode if
anyone gets close!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A-are you dense?! If you did that, we
wouldn't be able to get out of here!{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You don't have to go that far! Just...be
roughly as intense in your vigilance!

label: Talk_209

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}We'll make that rotten Link pay for what
he did!

He may have caught us off guard last
time, but he's in for a nasty surprise if
he tries it again!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}You must be the new blademaster. If the
rumors are anything to go by, then we
branches are lucky to have you.
And you're here not a moment too soon.
Link let the tailor who made our outfits
escape. Could you catch us a new one?
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You can recognize tailors by their {{color id="0"}}gaudy

should do for a replacement.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh! I didn't mean to trouble you with
such a mundane task, blademaster.
My apologies!
Those tailors are always walking down
any old {{color id="0"}}road{{color id="-1"}}, ready for the nabbing.
I really should handle it myself!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What is it? Are you looking for more work
on top of your blademasterly duties?
Your dedication is admirable.
Then I have just the task for you. Link let
the tailor who made our outfits escape,
so could you catch us a new one?
You can recognize tailors by their {{color id="0"}}gaudy
outfits{{color id="-1"}}. If you see one, we'd appreciate it
if you kidnapped them for us.
