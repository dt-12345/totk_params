The food's still not ready?

Hoo boy. I'm stuffed.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey! It's good to see you again.

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks again for your help when I was
stuck in those ruins over in Faron.

If you hadn't come by, I'd sure be hungry
by now!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway, after that I met up with my
friends to wrap up all the Skyview Tower
maintenance requests.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}We stayed in all sorts of places, but we
kept hearing about the incredible food at
Bedrock Bistro.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The timing was perfect, so I had to come
give it a try.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But I've been waiting for ages, and the
food hasn't shown up.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I've heard the owner arguing with other
customers.{{delay8}} I'm getting kind of worried...

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And wow! I definitely recommend it.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I can't wait to tell Sawson and Billson
how good it is...

Sawson?

---
label: 0001
---
Billson?

---
label: 0003
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I would have liked to spend some time
off with Sawson and Billson.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sawson is a friend from work. We started
climbing Death Mountain together...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But he wanted to continue on to the
Goron Hot Springs, so we split up.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I told him there were plenty of hot springs
around, but he wasn't having it. {{delay8}}No, only
special springs for him!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Billson is a friend from work. He's a Rito
carpenter—if you're looking for him, keep
an eye out for his headband.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I invited him, but he's a picky eater.
Said he wasn't interested.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}He's a stubborn one. Even if he's
starving, there are some things he
won't eat.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}He flew off south, saying something about
eating fish.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}OK. {{delay8}}Later!

Trying the hot springs?
