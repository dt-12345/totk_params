{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey! What do you think you're up to?{{delay15}}
I'm using that as a backrest right now, so
maybe...leave it alone?
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's not a great backrest though. Much too rigid...{{delay8}}
Maybe one day I'll once more lounge on the sofas in
the canteen on the surface.{{delay8}} One day...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Ugh! Come on!{{delay8}} What'd I just say?
I'm resting against that, so just...leave
it alone!
Aw, and I'd just gotten comfortable too!
Now I have to find that sweet spot again.

Ugh. This thing...

---
label: talk0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So you know the voe that's been locked
up in {{color id="0"}}jail{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Oh yeah, the one that used the sand
shroud to try to sneak into town?

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What about him?

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Wait, is this about what you heard?

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}A little while ago, I went to grab
something from {{color id="0"}}that shelf {{color id="-1"}}over there...

And while I was standing there, I swear I
heard someone say "{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}."

---
label: talk0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yup. I heard it coming from{{color id="0"}} behind
that shelf{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}

I'm almost certain it was a voice
saying "{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}."

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hey, I've heard "Aaqlet" before. I think
that's the name of {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}'s vehvi...

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know, the jail is just on the other side
of that wall. The wall behind the shelf,
I mean.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've been wondering if maybe it's {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}'s
husband locked up in there...

---
label: talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}If that was the case, Perda would have
realized it by now though. {{delay15}}Wouldn't she?

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}She's working at the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Secret Club{{color id="-1"}},
so {{color id="0"}}she's not in the shelter{{color id="-1"}}. Maybe that's
why she hasn't heard?

---
label: talk0015
---
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Most everyone has been avoiding eye contact
with this voe.

Including me...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0032
---
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Most everyone has been avoiding eye contact
with this voe.

Well... They're probably all just shocked by his
terrible manners.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0033
---
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Most everyone who has been avoiding eye contact
with this voe.

Maybe he'll get down off the table sometime soon?{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That reminds me of something I heard
when Perda came back to town with little
Aaqlet in tow.
Didn't the guards mention they'd seen a
voe wandering about outside of town
around then?

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}That has to be who it is.

---
label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Are you sure you really heard a voice
say "{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}"?

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Yes, I'm sure of it! And it came from over
there {{color id="0"}}behind that shelf{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So that voe they threw in jail really must
be {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}'s husband, right?

But if that is the case...


Perda wouldn't even know! After all, she's
working at the {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Secret Club{{color id="-1"}}, so
{{color id="0"}}she's not in the shelter{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know that voe that's locked up in the
{{color id="0"}}jail down in the shelter{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Well, I thought I heard someone say
"{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}" when I was standing {{color id="0"}}by the
shelf{{color id="-1"}} in the canteen down there.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I heard someone say "{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}" when I was
standing {{color id="0"}}by the shelf{{color id="-1"}} in the canteen down
in the shelter.
It must have been the voe in the
{{color id="0"}}jail{{color id="-1"}} talking...

---
label: talk0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}It's true, I'm telling you!


I heard it{{color id="0"}} down in the canteen{{color id="-1"}} in the
shelter. The voice came from {{color id="0"}}behind
the shelf{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: near0002
---
The voe in jail...

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now that you mention it...


I do remember something from when
Perda came back to town with little
Aaqlet in tow.
Didn't the guards mention they'd seen a
voe wandering about outside of town
around then?

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Then the voe that's locked up in the
jail cell...

He must be {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}'s husband after all.

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}All this talk just makes me think I should
find a voe for myself too.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}...

---
label: near0003
---
Ugh, my back...

---
label: talk0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}My back is so sore...

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}That {{color id="0"}}stupid{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} weird orb{{color id="-1"}} was a terrible thing
to rest against.

---
label: talk0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Meanwhile, these sofas are the absolute
best. {{delay15}}If I could, I would sit here forever.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ugh...{{delay15}} I don't even want to think about
setting out in search of my true love...

---
label: talk0035
---
{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It would be a lot easier if there were voe
somewhere nearby. {{delay8}}Just...waiting for us
to discover them.

---
label: talk0036
---
{{anim type="Chat_00"}}What about that Hylian voe who helped
clear up the sand shroud?

He seemed OK...

---
label: talk0037
---
{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Yeah. I think he'd make an acceptable
partner, at least.

He is certainly strong. There's no doubt
about that.

---
label: talk0038
---
{{anim type="Think_01"}}I agree. He's definitely OK at least.


Huh.{{delay8}} Maybe he'd be worth a second look
the next time he comes to town?

---
label: talk0039
---
{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ooh, I like this idea! If one of us found our
true love without having to travel... That'd
be so easy!
