{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, a traveler!{{delay8}} It is amazing that you made
it here through all of the sludge.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}An enormous amount of that muck fell not
too long ago, but you and I have somehow
avoided getting caught in it.
Thanks to Lady Yona's guidance, we were
able to save those buried in the sludge in
the nick of time. However...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Now that gunk is woefully stuck to our
domain's precious statue...{{delay8}}

Hm...{{delay8}} How are we to rectify this?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Thanks to Lady Yona's guidance, we were
able to save everyone in the nick of time.
However...
The domain's precious statue is now
covered in sludge...{{delay15}} What are we to do?

Well then!

---
label: talk0013

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I witnessed it with my own two
eyes, Hylian!

You have removed that dreadful sludge
from our statue!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Our once-sullied statue, which was awash 
in abominable sludge, is pristine again!{{delay15}}
It is all thanks to you!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I have no doubt that Lady Yona will be
positively elated!

Ahoy, waterfall!

---
label: talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it is you! You really helped me out,
so here is a bit of advice for you.

If your gills... {{delay8}}No, wait. You are a Hylian.
What is that thing called? {{delay15}}Ah! Your nose!

In any case, if that thing gets stuffed up
with sludge, you can wash up in the water
from that waterfall.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Do not worry. That is the water that
{{color id="0"}}Prince Sidon {{color id="-1"}}cleaned at {{color id="0"}}Mipha Court{{color id="-1"}},
which is upstream.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I recall that Prince Sidon was once a tad
headstrong...{{delay8}}and now he is handling this
sludge with utmost patience and maturity.
I suppose the old wisdom holds true...
Turbulent waters produce strong fish.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}The water that{{color id="0"}} Prince Sidon {{color id="-1"}}is cleaning in
{{color id="0"}}Mipha Court{{color id="-1"}}... That is the last pure water
source for all of Zora's Domain.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}We all owe a debt of gratitude to the great
Prince Sidon, who hastily devised a plan
to keep us safe from the sludge...

Sweet, life-giving water!

label: talk0003

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I am so grateful to Prince Sidon, who is
bravely cleaning the water upstream!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Once we overcome this danger, I hope to
arrange a display of swim dancing at the
base of the waterfall as a token of thanks.
It does not sound so bad, showing our
appreciation while being showered by the
pristine waters of the waterfall!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oooh, yes! Just thinking about it, I can
almost feel those cool waters upon my
overly dry scales!

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Just gazing upon a pristine waterfall is
enough to cleanse my very soul!
And yet...

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Spirit aside, I also want to cleanse my
material form in perfectly clean waters.
I simply cannot wait!
Ah, to soak to my heart's content at the
waterfall basin... *siiigh* But to do that,
we must first overcome this sludge!

---
label: talk0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I am overflowing with gratitude to our
valiant Prince Sidon for purifying the
water upstream!
I dream of ascending waterfalls to my
heart's content once we have made it
through these dangerous times!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh?{{delay8}} Link!{{delay15}} Am I mistaken or do you, too,
dream of climbing waterfalls?

---
label: talk0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hmm...{{delay15}} Fear not, brave one. I have heard
whisperings that even a Hylian can climb
waterfalls if they wear the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk0022

Alas, that is the extent of my knowledge!{{delay8}}
I am sorry I could not be of more help on
that front.

label: talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Upon your noble torso...{{delay15}} That is the
Zora armor, is it not?!

With that armor, even a Hylian like you
can experience the joy of climbing
waterfalls!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I now feel no guilt in gushing that climbing
waterfalls is truly exhilarating! Yes, utterly
invigorating!{{delay8}} I implore you to give it a try!

---
label: talk0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Yes, indeed! {{delay15}}The Zora armor is truly
wondrous!

If you wear the Zora armor, even a Hylian
like you can experience the joy of climbing
waterfalls!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Please, I implore you to give it a try!

guard duty, {{delay15}}otherwise I would jump into a

What is that light?

label: talk0004

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Has that light captured your interest
as well?

I came to investigate, however...{{delay8}} I have no
idea what the cause of that light could be.

---
label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm...{{delay8}} I wonder if I should report this
to Prince Sidon.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}I do not want to leave this place,

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}As I was watching the pillar of light at
East Reservoir Lake, Prince Sidon came
