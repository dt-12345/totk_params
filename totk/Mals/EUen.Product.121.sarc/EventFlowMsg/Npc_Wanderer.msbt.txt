{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Well, if it isn't Link. I am always pleased
to find you in good health.

I only just came back to the village myself.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I have been thinking of those glimpses
you had of the Light Dragon's—or rather,
Princess Zelda's—memories.
It seems as though that must be an omen
of some kind.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The village is now in Paya's hands as
chief, so I intend to keep looking for a
way to restore the princess.
You ought to devote your efforts to
calming the effects of the Upheaval.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So... Link...

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Perhaps you recognize what is shown
on that screen.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It is a part of our history which must never
be forgotten—the Calamity.

---
label: 0002
---
The Calamity?

---
label: 0003
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Calamity was the Demon King of
ancient times, brought back to existence
in the form of hatred manifest.
Some of our youths believe the Calamity
to be mere legend. You and I know better,
of course.
Shown here are the royal princess with
the power to seal away evil...{{delay8}}and a warrior
chosen by a legendary sword.
This image depicts how, using four
relics called Divine Beasts built by our
ancestors, they drove off the Calamity.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That reminds me. Symin told me he is
teaching the children at {{color id="0"}}Hateno School{{color id="-1"}}
a {{color id="0"}}lesson about the Calamity{{color id="-1"}}.
The school is in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} to the
{{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}}, not far from here.

Why not drop by and take the
lesson yourself?

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. You are here early.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. You are here.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. You chose a late hour to
drop by.

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. Isn't it raining outside?
And still you came.

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wanted to see with my own eyes what
I had previously only read of in books.

That was why I ceded my position as chief
and left with Cado.

Poor Paya. She was shocked to have
the mantle of leadership thrust upon her
so suddenly.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But I knew that within her lay the seeds
of a capable chief.

All those seeds needed was a chance
to grow.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now Paya is firmly on her own path as the
leader of the village.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}To see my granddaughter learning to
{{color id="0"}}decipher the Zonai language{{color id="-1"}}... It is a
delight, if certainly not a surprise.
And it means that I can rest easy in
my retirement.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That reminds me. Purah left a
journal here.

But where did I put it?


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}She told me to hide the thing. Perhaps I
followed her instructions too well.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I managed to conceal it from myself.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You have caught glimpses of Princess
Zelda's memories...

That certainly seems as though it must be
an omen of some kind.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The village is now in Paya's hands
as chief, so I can pour over the
literature freely.
You ought to devote your efforts to
calming the effects of the Upheaval.

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Ah. I see that you are wearing the attire of
the ancient hero.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}How amusing. {{delay8}}You almost look like that
figure depicted on the screen...

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}...But first, you should at least put a
shirt on.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}And Link... We may be old friends, but I
still expect you to show respect in the
chief's hall.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Would you at least put a shirt on?

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}And Link... I will remind you this village
has a history with the Yiga Clan.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}So please, stop this tasteless prank, and
put something else on!
