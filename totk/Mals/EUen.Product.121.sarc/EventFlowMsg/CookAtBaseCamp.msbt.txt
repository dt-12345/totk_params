{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hey, are you new here? You may scoff,
but I know a fresh face when I see one.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I can say that because I'm a newcomer
too! My name's Burmano, and they put
me in charge of cooking for some reason.
I want to say something fancy like, "For
today's menu, we have a {{color id="0"}}fruit and
mushroom mix{{color id="-1"}} that'll rev you right up!"{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Yeah... I was really looking forward to
saying that, but...

label: Talk_1_2

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm plumb out of {{color id="0"}}apples{{color id="-1"}}! If I don't have my
most important ingredient, say goodbye to
rich, full flavor!

label: Talk_1_4

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I thought I was so ready to energize folks
around here with my {{color id="0"}}fruit and mushroom
mix{{color id="-1"}}...
But I've got no {{color id="0"}}apples{{color id="-1"}}! I'm missing my
most important ingredient!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Mmm... My nose is detecting an aroma, a
sweet, tangy, pleasant aroma.{{delay15}} Could it
be?{{delay15}} Do you have an {{color id="0"}}apple{{color id="-1"}}?

I don't have one.

---
label: Talk_1_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Right. Of course. As if you'd just magically
have one... My nose is rarely mistaken, 
but I understand.
Now, if you did have an {{color id="0"}}apple{{color id="-1"}}, I'd let you
in on some {{color id="0"}}fruit and mushroom mix{{color id="-1"}}
goodness. So keep that in mind.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Wow! You're really generous!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm giving you first crack at some grub.
Hold on a sec!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}It, uh, seems like your pouch is full.


If you want to sample my fabulous
cooking, you'll need to be able to hold it!

label: Talk_1_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}It'll be better for both of us if you sample
my cooking while it's piping hot!

Hurry up, and clear some space in your
pouch so I can get cooking!

---
label: Talk_1_14

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}New kid! It looks like you cleared some
space in your pouch.

I'll get on with the cooking right away!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm calling it "Burmano's special fruit and
mushroom mix"! Looks tasty, doesn't it?

---
label: Talk_1_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I like to make a big deal out of it, but...


Anyone can make it. All you need is an
apple, a mushroom, and a pot.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You should try making some!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}If I just had an {{color id="0"}}apple{{color id="-1"}}, I could whip up
some {{color id="0"}}fruit and mushroom mix{{color id="-1"}}...
