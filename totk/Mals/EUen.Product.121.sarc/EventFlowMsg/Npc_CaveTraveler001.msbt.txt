Hmmm...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}These {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrog {{color id="-1"}}creatures are supposed
to live in caves, eh?

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}WAAAH!


{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Don't scare me like that! My poor heart
can't take it!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Eh?{{delay15}} Are you by chance looking for
{{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs{{color id="-1"}} too?

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh.{{delay8}} What a shame, what a shame...

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Aha! I knew it! They must have asked
you too.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Supposedly, there are creatures called
{{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs{{color id="-1"}} that live in caves.

They're bluish and whitish and stick to
walls. Odd stuff.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And those two folks at {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}
in northeast Eldin—curious pair, very
strange, maybe a little off...
They're looking for something the
{{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs drop{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} They asked me to
do the collecting.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}So.{{delay15}} Did they ask you too?

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}They offered treasure in exchange.
Good treasure! It was a sweet deal.{{delay8}}
At least, it would have been...
But I don't know the first thing about
cave creatures.{{pageBreak}}That treasure was awful appealing
though...

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Caves are really dangerous. Is finding
{{color id="0"}}Bubbul gems{{color id="-1"}} even worth it?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Eh? Ah, you again.


Caves are dangerous, you know. Is finding
{{color id="0"}}Bubbul gems{{color id="-1"}} even worth it?

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm just going to cross my fingers and
wish real hard that I'll get the treasure
without any effort whatsoever.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's in the name. Some kind of weird thing
{{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs {{color id="-1"}}drop in caves.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All I know is that it glows a bluish white,
just like the Bubbulfrog.

Eh?{{delay8}} Wait a second...


That strange pair over at {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}
in Eldin to the northeast—the ones who
asked me to find {{color id="0"}}Bubbul gems{{color id="-1"}}...
One of them was bluish white. Odd color.


{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You don't think he got cursed by a
Bubbulfrog, do you?!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Ooh, this is really dangerous. When things
sound too good, there's always a catch...

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'm done looking for Bubbul gems.
Done. Done!

And you should be done too, or you'll
end up a funny color, just like the guy at
Woodland Stable!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That said, it's a shame about that
treasure... {{delay8}}I'd never even heard of a
{{color id="0"}}mystic robe{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}} Maybe...
No!{{delay8}} I'm definitely done!{{delay8}} Definitely...

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But that treasure... Ooh, it's hard to give
up a trade like that...

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}What?!{{delay15}} You got your hands on a
{{color id="0"}}Bubbul gem{{color id="-1"}}?!

You had the courage to not only go in a
cave but to face down a strange creature?
You're a brave one, that's for sure.

---
label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Turns out {{color id="0"}}Bubbulfrogs{{color id="-1"}} can be found
{{color id="0"}}in every cave{{color id="-1"}}. So I'm thinking I'll maybe
check out another cave.
Though, I doubt I'll be able to find one
that isn't dark and scary.

---
label: Talk_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you managed to get your hands on
a Bubbul gem...{{pageBreak}}you should try to find those two
oddballs at {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}} in
Eldin to the northeast.
Those fellas were in a real frenzy to find
those gems. I bet you'll find them in the
{{color id="0"}}cave near the stable{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I heard them talking about some rare
treasure they had. I think it was a
{{color id="0"}}mystic robe{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}or something like that.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Yeah, might not be a bad idea to go
see them.

That's right.

Nope.

I'll leave you to it.

What's a Bubbulfrog?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hi there.{{delay15}} You look like someone on
a real journey.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}If you've made your way to a stable in
this kind of downpour, you must be
quite the traveler.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Good evening.{{delay15}} You look like someone on
quite a journey.

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there.

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello there.{{delay8}} Pleasant evening
we're having.

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, I ran into you before, didn't I...{{delay15}}
at the cave.

---
label: Talk_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You're...{{delay15}}the one who was searching
for the same Bubbulfrog I was, if I'm
not mistaken.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah,{{delay8}} I ran into you recently, didn't I?

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ugh, this is some awful weather
we're having.

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So, strange story... I ran into these two
folks—curious pair, odd even—at
Woodland Stable up north in Eldin...
And they asked me to search for this
creature called a Bubbulfrog that's
supposed to be found in caves.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But the thing about caves is...{{delay8}}they're
dark, and you don't know what's hiding
in them.
Plus, the pair in question just up and
disappeared from the stable.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}After we met, curiosity got the better of
me and I decided to go looking for a
Bubbulfrog in a cave.
But that was...not a great idea. {{delay8}}Caves are
dark, and there's no way to know what's
lurking around in there.
Plus, that strange duo... They just up and
disappeared from Woodland Stable!

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}After that, I didn't really know what to do
with myself...so I did some wandering and
some thinking too, and ended up here.
And you know, I've decided that I'm a
careful man, and I'll take comfort and
safety over rewards and riches any day.

---
label: Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The thing is,{{delay8}} stables are very pleasant
places to be—comfortable, safe.

Bubbulfrog hunting in a dark cave...{{delay8}}no,
thanks. A cautious guy like me is better
suited to relaxing in a place like this. 

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Still though...{{delay15}} I do wonder where that
strange duo looking for the Bubbulfrogs
disappeared to.
With that {{color id="0"}}motley-looking cart{{color id="-1"}} they
were pulling, you'd think they'd be
easy to spot anywhere...
