{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I know what you are...{{delay15}}monster.


You've come for my {{color id="0"}}blessing of clothing
enhancement{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've heard this land is now smothered in
gloom and overrun with monsters. 

Oh! I'll never hear a musical troupe
pass by again, and the sweet notes
of its {{color id="0"}}violin {{color id="-1"}}player...
I'm staying sealed up in my flower bud
for the rest of eternity—or until I hear
a violin in the world once more!

label: Talk_1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I came here to be close to a {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}}, where
I could offer my blessings to travelers.

But now, until I hear a {{color id="0"}}violin{{color id="-1"}} played by a
musician in a troupe...{{delay8}}

I can't bear the thought of ever going
outside ever again.

---
label: Talk_1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'd hoped to offer travelers my {{color id="0"}}blessing
of clothing enhancement{{color id="-1"}}. So many need
help in these trying times.
Then I learned that the land had been
lost to gloom and monsters, and I knew
no one would endure such a world.
Perhaps if I heard a {{color id="0"}}violin{{color id="-1"}} played in a
musical troupe,{{delay8}} I could bear the thought
of being outside again.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The air out here is terrible.

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hmm. It smells a bit of gloom, I think.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It seems that the world is still in a
wretched state.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Maybe I'm imagining it, but my throat
doesn't feel quite right. Perhaps it's
because of the gloom.

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}...You came to me to have your clothing

{{anim type="Sad"}}Awww... Well, that's just a shame.

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It seems my little sisters are still
secluding themselves in their flower

If you see a giant {{color id="0"}}flower bud {{color id="-1"}}as you

lovely music for them too.

{{anim type="Think_01"}}My little sister Kaysa said she was going
to a stable near the Gerudo region
southwest from here.

If you ever have need of our power,{{delay8}} just
stop on by.

label: ComTalk_005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I wanted to make some of your other
clothes stronger,{{delay8}} but that just doesn't
seem possible.

label: ComTalk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You are lacking either the clothes or the
materials...{{delay8}} Or perhaps if I had access to
my sisters' powers...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}When you're carrying the clothes and
materials with you,{{delay8}} please come back
and visit me here!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, close your eyes...

label: ComTalk_009

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Which clothing item would you like me
to enhance?

label: ComTalk_010

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What about the others?

---
label: ComTalk_011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Let's see... What's stopping me from
enhancing these things, I wonder...

---
label: ComTalk_012
---
{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Ah. Ignoring the fact that you're going to
get an awful sunburn walking around like
that during the day...
Do you really not have any clothing?
When you get some clothing that I can
enhance, come visit and I'll do my thing!

---
label: ComTalk_013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What's this?{{delay15}} You don't have any clothes
that I can enhance? None at all?

How about we take a look, just to be
sure.{{delay15}} Let me see what you have.

---
label: ComTalk_014

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}With the power available to me...{{delay8}}
I should be able to enhance your
clothing {{color id="0"}}a little bit{{color id="-1"}}!

{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}With the power available to me...{{delay8}}

to enhance that clothing item...

label: ComTalk_023

{{anim type="Angry"}}I'm sorrrry!{{delay8}} There are some clothing
items that I cannot enhance, even at
my power level.

label: ComTalk_024

{{anim type="Sad"}}Hmmm... {{delay8}}It is impossible for me to
enhance that clothing item...

---
label: ComTalk_025

{{anim type="Sad"}}That clothing item... It's just not
possible...{{delay8}} Even I have my limits.

---
label: ComTalk_026
---
{{anim type="Sad"}}I can't enhance that item now! If my
sisters were revitalized as well,
that would be a different story...

---
label: ComTalk_027
---
{{anim type="Sad"}}I cannot enhance that with my power
alone, you know? I would need the help
of my sisters as well.

---
label: ComTalk_028
---
{{anim type="Sad"}}Ahh. {{delay8}}There's no way I can enhance that
clothing item! Not with my power alone.

---
label: ComTalk_029
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you want me to enhance that clothing
item,{{delay8}} you will need to aid my sisters.

{{anim type="Notice"}}You don't have the materials I need to
work my magic! Once you have them all,
come back to see me!

{{anim type="Think"}}Oh... {{delay8}}You don't have the materials I need.
There isn't a lot I can do if you don't have
the materials...

label: ComTalk_032

{{anim type="Notice"}}If you want me to enhance that clothing
item,{{delay8}} you're going to have to bring me
the materials...

{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You don't have the materials needed to
enhance that clothing item,{{delay8}} so I can't do
it. What a bother.

label: ComTalk_101
---
{{anim type="Notice"}}It looks you don't have enough rupees.
My power won't function without funds,
I fear.

---
label: ComTalk_102
---
{{anim type="Think"}}Oh dear! {{delay8}}You know you don't have
enough rupees, don't you? My powers
just won't manifest without rupees.

---
label: ComTalk_103
---
{{anim type="Notice"}}If you want me to enhance that clothing,{{delay8}}
then you'll need more rupees on hand!

---
label: ComTalk_104
---
{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Without the necessary rupees,{{delay8}} then I'm
afraid I can't grant you my blessing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh? No need to be shy, you know.

label: ComTalk_035

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, {{delay8}}want to try another one?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Perfection!{{delay15}} It's almost TOO beautiful,
if I do say so myself.

and sturdier it is!

{{anim type="Happy"}}All done! Amazing! Very fine work,
I must say.

A resourceful hero like you surely wants
to unlock even greater potential, yes?

Some sets—if you enhance each part of
the set twice—will give you a {{color id="0"}}special
bonus{{color id="-1"}} when you wear them.
Not every set, mind you!{{delay15}} But some...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, some sets—if you enhance
