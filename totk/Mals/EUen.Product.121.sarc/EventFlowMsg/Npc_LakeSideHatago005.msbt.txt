Is that a ring garland?

What a wild streak!

Is that a monster, or...

That's a special horse.

---
label: LargeHorse

Will that fit in the stable?

---
label: Talk_1000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}For crying out loud...


Of all the places those monsters could
go, they decide to settle down in those
caves? OUR caves?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wonder if there's some way to chase
them out for the stable's sake.

---
label: Talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}...Huh?{{delay8}} Oh! Hello, hello!


I was so deep in thought, I didn't notice
you there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You didn't happen to, ah...hear what
I was saying, did you?

---
label: 0001
---
Monsters?

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I guess you did hear.


There are {{color id="0"}}three caves {{color id="-1"}}that appeared
around here after the Upheaval.

---
label: Talk_1035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}They're all up there. One is near
{{color id="0"}}Corta Lake{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_1036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}another next to {{color id="0"}}Rodai Lake{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_1037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}and the last over by {{color id="0"}}Calora Lake{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Though it's hard to see where they are
with this unfortunate weather...

---
label: Talk_1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Though it's hard to see where they are
at this hour...

---
label: Talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Huge deposits of luminous stone can be
mined in those caves, so they're popular
spots for travelers. {{delay8}}Or, they were.
Then the {{color id="0"}}three giant monster brothers{{color id="-1"}}
showed up.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Those three used to be over in Taran Pass
to the northeast, but now they're in our
region, hogging the caves for themselves.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If we don't do something, travelers will
stop coming here, and business at the
stable will dry up!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}I can't win.{{delay8}} It's not as though
they'll up and leave.

---

Hm? What?

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}OK, funny guy! Don't pretend you
weren't listening!

Fine, then. I won't tell you about it.
You can just tell me what's going on in
your life.{{delay15}} OK?

---
label: Talk_1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}*cough*


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}Uh...


Sheesh, all right. There are {{color id="0"}}three
caves {{color id="-1"}}that appeared around here
after the Upheaval.

---
label: 0003
---
I took care of it.

---
label: Talk_1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay8}}What did you just say?


You drove away the monsters, buddy?

---
label: Talk_1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? You're kidding! You did?!

---
label: Talk_1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}...But the monsters aren't all gone yet.


I'm glad the caves are a little safer,
really I am. {{delay8}}But...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If even one of those things is still around,
we have no way of knowing which cave it
might sleep in.
Travelers won't be safe in any of them.


You have to drive all of the monsters off,
or this stable will keep losing customers.

---
label: Talk_1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hm...{{delay8}} If the monster rumors spread too
far, it's a safe bet that we'll see fewer and
fewer stable visitors.
If we don't do something, business will
go belly-up!

---
label: Talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}With {{color id="0"}}the caves {{color id="-1"}}occupied by the monsters,
fewer and fewer customers are coming
to the stable.
If only some brave someone would drive
away the {{color id="0"}}three giant monster brothers{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: 0004
---
Caves?

---
label: Talk_1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}See that big waterfall? There are three
caves around it.

---
label: Talk_1038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}In those caves, there's luminous stone.
I'm talking tons of the stuff, ripe for
the taking!
That's what made them such popular
destinations for travelers around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}And then... Well, who could have guessed
that this would happen?

---
label: 0005
---
Monsters?

---
label: Talk_1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Travelers through these parts say that
they're vicious beasts who used to live
in Taran Pass.
But recently, for some reason, all three
of them came here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Most of the time they're asleep, but so
much as get near them and they'll wake
up and go berserk.
With them around, nobody can go inside
the caves.

---
label: 0006
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Right. Don't offer to help or anything...


Those three caves are mining hot spots
made by the Upheaval.

They drew a lot of travelers here,
to Lakeside Stable.

But with the three giant monster brothers
holing up inside, nobody comes to the
caves anymore.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anything else you want to ask about?

---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Thanks to you, there aren't {{color id="0"}}three giant
monster brothers {{color id="-1"}}in the caves. But even
one is too many!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Until all three of them are gone, guests
won't start coming to the stable again...

---
label: Talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Listen up! I've got some great news!


Word has it that those three giant
monster brothers finally left the caves!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh? {{delay8}}What's that now?


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}You did it?!{{size value="100"}}


You mean...you defeated all three of the
monsters by yourself?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I've seen enough faces in this job that I
can tell from looking at one if someone's
lying to me.
{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}And you...{{delay8}}aren't!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}I don't even have to go check. You really
did do it! You defeated the monsters!

On behalf of all of us at the stable,
thank you! Please, take this small symbol
of our appreciation.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}With those pesky brothers gone at last,
the guests will start pouring back in!

I guess I'd better get back to work, huh?{{pageBreak}}And, listen, you've got your reward. But
if you ever need luminous stones, feel
free to take all you need from the caves.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}And there are plenty of areas of interest
besides those caves for you to see
around here.
Not to mention rare animals that you can
only find around this stable. Take it easy.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh... {{delay8}}Shoot! Your pouch is full.


I was going to give you a special meal

Come back when you've made some
space, and I'll give it to you. {{delay15}}No rush
at all.

label: Talk_1062

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_01"}}As a reward for defeating the three

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey there! Thanks for taking care of the
three giant monster brothers.

Have you had a chance to explore the
area around here?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In this region, there are lots of things
you won't find anywhere else.

My recommendations, you ask? Well,
let me think on that...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I know you know this, but those {{color id="0"}}three
caves {{color id="-1"}}nearby are a miner's dream. You
can get lots of luminous stone from them.
There's also {{color id="0"}}that animal {{color id="-1"}}that was
discovered recently.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Those are two special attractions you
won't find anywhere else.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, buddy. You already went to the
{{color id="0"}}three caves {{color id="-1"}}past Floria Falls, right?

Then did you come across {{color id="0"}}that animal{{color id="-1"}}
along the way? The one you can only
see near this stable.

---
label: 0007
---
Three caves?

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You're kidding... Right? Did you forget?


The three caves near Floria Falls, where
you drove out the giant monster brothers.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's lots of luminous stone for the
taking in them, so they're very popular
places for travelers!

---
label: 0008
---
Animal?

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? Don't tell me you haven't heard
about it!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It's practically all anyone can talk about
right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}From the stable, cross the river, and
you'll soon see some strange creatures.

Goodbye.

---
label: Talk1014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We get a lot of thunderstorms here.
If you're carrying anything metal,
be careful.
You'll be safer inside. When you hear
thunder, find shelter as soon as you can.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anything else?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}Mmm... *mumble*

---
label: Talk1040

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Take care where you climb. Don't want to
slip off a cliff.

---
label: Talk1050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're going out in that lightning, you
should put all your metal things away.

Lightning seems to like it here, so
be careful.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You heading out somewhere? Be careful.
Around here, rain can kick up without any
warning at all.
