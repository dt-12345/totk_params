{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah! Link. You have done it!


{{anim type="Happy_01"}}With your help, King Sidon has
realized his full potential and
become a worthy successor.
I can now leave Zora's Domain free of
concern. It is inarguably in good hands.

As it were, I have been tasked with joining
Purah as a representative of the domain.

{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I look forward to joining my efforts with
those of our brave Zora soldiers.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heh... In truth, it has been a long while
since I have left the familiar waters of
the domain.
I must admit, the challenge of the
unknown fills me with more excitement
than is befitting a Zora of my age.
