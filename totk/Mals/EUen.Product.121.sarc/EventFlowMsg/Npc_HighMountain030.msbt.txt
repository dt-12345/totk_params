I'd better get going...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What possessed a Hylian to come out
here? Don't act like you don't feel the
weather. I can see you shivering inside.{{pageBreak}}This isn't a good time to talk anyway.
I was about to join Gesane in the effort
to scavenge for food.{{pageBreak}}The longer this blizzard goes, the harder
it gets just to keep ourselves fed.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}No time for small talk. I need to go join
Gesane in the food-gathering effort.{{pageBreak}}If you really need to talk to me, find me
later and we can chat then.

---
label: Near03

This is a good haul.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Didn't think I'd be seeing anyone else in
these mountains anytime soon, what with
the blizzard and all.{{pageBreak}}I'M here because it's a good place to find
food for my people. Why are YOU here?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Looking for Tulin, huh? Fair enough.{{pageBreak}}He's farther in this cave with Gesane.
They're scavenging for food.{{pageBreak}}No, I'm not going to show you the way.
I need to keep an eye on what we've
amassed so far.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Be on your guard. There's a creature in
that cave that hops around on the walls.{{pageBreak}}It probably won't bother you if you stay
away from it. Good luck finding Tulin.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're looking for Tulin, he and Gesane
went deep into the cave to scavenge
for food.
It's a long way to where they are though,
and I can't exactly go with you.{{pageBreak}}The moment I take my eyes off our stuff,
I just know some monster's going to come
along and snatch it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're going in to find Tulin, watch out
for the creature that hops around on the
walls in there.{{pageBreak}}I don't think it'll hurt you if you stay away
from it, but you never know.

Not a bad harvest.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I just lugged the food we scavenged from
the cave back to the village.{{pageBreak}}It was a pretty good harvest, but not so
good that we can breathe easy.{{pageBreak}}Once I'm rested, it's back to the food
hunt for me.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The food we scrounged is safe and sound
in the village now, but our work isn't over.{{pageBreak}}Once I've had a rest, I'll be right back
at it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now where did I see it?

---
label: 0001
---
I found it.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? You found the cave?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Huh! {{delay15}}So the "bird" I saw was some snow
that overlapped with the perch's shadow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What a relief! {{delay8}}I feel so much better now
that I know what was going on there.{{pageBreak}}Thanks! {{delay8}}I'm going to find Bedoli so we
can check out the cave together!

---
label: Near07
---
So that's where it was.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Thanks for tracking down that cave.{{pageBreak}}Bedoli is over there organizing the
supplies, so I'll wait until she's free
to invite her to go check it out.{{pageBreak}}The more bodies we bring, the more food
we can haul back to the village.

Almost home...

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}So ends another busy day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My little sister, Bedoli, is swamped every
day with managing our supplies. We
barely ever get to see each other.{{pageBreak}}Hopefully our jobs should calm down soon
now that the blizzard has stopped.

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Shouldn't be much longer before the
food shortage is resolved. {{delay15}}I think we're
going to make it just fine.

label: Near08
---
Back to work I go!

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}The blizzard stopping has been a big load
off my mind.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}That said, we're still short on supplies,
and I still spend a lot of time every day
gathering food.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}No rest for the weary! But it's good not to
have to do it under the pressure that the
blizzard forced on us.{{pageBreak}}Anyway. Time for another day's
honest work!
