{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, you! Interested in my {{color id="0"}}compendium
database{{color id="-1"}}, I see...

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}My collection is complete! It has every
creature, monster, material, treasure,
and piece of equipment.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's basically the same thing as the
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Compendium{{color id="-1"}} you've got on your
Purah Pad—except mine's finished.
When you take a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}} of these kinds
of subjects, they'll be {{color id="0"}}registered in your
compendium{{color id="-1"}}.
I've got some mighty elusive entries in
my collection. You might find it a real
challenge to get them on your own...
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Say, I'll tell you what. I'll sell you
{{color id="0"}}pictures {{color id="-1"}}that help fill out the gaps
in your compendium.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What's with that face?{{delay8}} Do you know how
hard I worked to complete this?!

All that work is priceless, so a few rupees
is a great deal!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look, no pressure. But if you want some
{{color id="0"}}pictures{{color id="-1"}} from {{color id="0"}}my compendium{{color id="-1"}}, just let
me know.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, you! Looks like my complete
{{color id="0"}}compendium {{color id="-1"}}has taken your fancy.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}No wonder! Collecting all those pictures
was no small feat, I'll tell you. And since
I know just how tough it is...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll tell you what. If you want some
pictures from my compendium, I'll be
glad to sell them to you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}By category, here's what's missing from
the {{color id="0"}}pictures {{color id="-1"}}in your Purah Pad.

label: Talk_2007
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}You want {{number2 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of my pictures? That'll
be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_2009

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Can't add any more of that picture type,

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, you!{{delay15}}


I'm all sold out of the pictures I had
in stock!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But there's no stopping an inquisitive
mind like mine! Perhaps very soon, I'll
get some new pictures!
And then you'll just have to come back!
Of course, you will always be welcome.

Compendium?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Compendium{{color id="-1"}} records all the
creatures, monsters, materials, treasure,
and equipment out there.
Your compendium is in your {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad{{color id="-1"}}.
And that's where I keep my collection.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}If you take a picture of these subjects
with your {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}, they'll be {{color id="0"}}registered in
your compendium{{color id="-1"}}. Neat, right?

---
label: Talk_2017
---
You can also take{{color id="0"}} self-portraits{{color id="-1"}}, too, that
work with your compendium.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Imagine taking a picture with weapons!{{delay15}}
You could see your face all over your
collection. Don't forget to say, "cheese!"

label: Talk_2003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't miss a chance to use that {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}},
got it?

label: Talk_2016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hmph. Did you finish up your business?
