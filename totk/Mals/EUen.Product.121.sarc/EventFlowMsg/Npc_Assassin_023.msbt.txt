{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm... {{delay8}}How am I supposed to activate
this construct?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}How can I get this thing moving?{{delay8}} I don't
even know where to begin.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've been examining this construct
for so long,{{delay8}} but I just can't seem to
get it working...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}Well, given that you showed up
down here, it can't hurt to ask...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Do you know how to activate constructs?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I've got to get my hands on the treasure
somehow... {{delay8}}Before that guy shows up...

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You do?! {{delay8}}I thought a famous hero like
you might!{{delay15}} In fact, I was sure of it!

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Liar! {{delay8}}You just think I'm suspicious and
don't want to tell me!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm trying to investigate this construct.{{delay8}}
I get that you're curious, but...I'd prefer
you didn't interrupt me.

---
label: talk_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}{{size value="125"}}Stop!{{size value="100"}}{{delay8}}

label: talk_1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}As you can clearly see, I'm trying to
examine this construct. Emphasis on
TRYING. So don't bother me!

---
label: talk_1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ah, forgive me for raising my voice.{{delay8}} I was
just so caught up in my investigation.

label: talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}First I'll rough you up a little...{{delay8}}then I'll
find a way to make you talk.

---
label: talk_1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Well, no matter. {{delay8}}I'll have all the time
I need to examine it after I defeat you.

label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} What am I doing here?{{delay8}} Isn't it
obvious?! I'm examining this construct!{{pageBreak}}So quit bothering me!

---
label: talk_1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Don't talk to me while I'm trying to think!{{delay8}}
Once I figure out how to activate the
thing, you'll know.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now scram!

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I'm still investigating this thing!{{delay8}}
