{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The meal on this poster sure looks tasty,
doesn't it?

label: Talk_2001

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It's a simple recipe. Just stew some fresh
seafood with Hylian tomato. {{delay8}}It's not just
delicious but nutritious too!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So once Tye comes home from—{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Ah, excuse me...{{delay8}} Once my husband comes
back from his travels in the north, this is
the meal I plan on cooking for him.

I used to get the fresh seafood to make
this from {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} out east of here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But that was before it got attacked by
{{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} Ah,{{delay8}} what am I to do?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah...{{delay8}} Excuse me.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}That's the meal I want to feed my
husband, Tye, when he gets back from
his travels.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Unfortunately, {{delay15}}acquiring the ingredients
has become complicated.{{pageBreak}}Normally, if you were in the market for
seafood, {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} would have
anything you could need.
Unfortunately, I hear they've been
attacked by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} What am I to do?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}That's the meal I want to welcome Tye—
my husband—home with once he's back
from his travels.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Unfortunately, {{delay8}}ever since {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}
was attacked by pirates, fresh seafood
has been much harder to come by.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Lurelin is a lively, peaceful little fishing
village. You can get there by taking the
road east from this stable.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It makes for a wonderful vacation spot,
too, especially if you're a fan of seafood.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I don't think I'll ever forget{{delay8}} the trip I took
there with my darling Tye.

label: Talk_2008

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It's awful to imagine that wonderful place
falling victim to {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I heard that Lurelin Village just suffered
a pirate attack, but I'm afraid I don't know
the particulars.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}It does sound as though the attack sent
all the visitors scattering, however.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Ugh. {{delay8}}All those poor people.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village {{color id="-1"}}was such a cheerful place.{{delay8}}
What's become of it now?

label: Talk_2011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}My dear husband, Tye, said he was going
alone on a journey up north to find
something to protect me with.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I admit, it's lonely being away from my
dear husband, but our hearts are always
connected.{{delay8}} At least, I like to think so.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}I wanted to cook a nice meal for
my husband's return, but pirates have
attacked {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}Where am I going to get my hands on
fresh seafood now?

label: Talk_2013

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Now that {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} is free of {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}},
I was hoping to go buy some seafood.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But what if my wonderful husband, Tye,
returns from his travels while I'm away?

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}He'd surely worry if I were gone...{{delay8}} Should
I wait patiently for him to come back?

label: Talk_2014

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I want Tye, my husband, to come home
from his travels to a wonderful meal.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If my darling Tye came back while I was
out, I'm sure he'd worry.

I was hoping to buy fresh seafood from
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin {{color id="-1"}}for his welcome-back meal, but...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I'd hoped the {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}' defeat would spell
the end of my problems. {{delay8}}I suppose I'll
keep sitting here, waiting.
