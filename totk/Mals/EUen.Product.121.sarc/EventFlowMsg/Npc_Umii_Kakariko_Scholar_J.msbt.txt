{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You come all the way out here to see the

Watch your step so you don't fall into that

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you just can't help yourself gloom-wise,
look for our resident gloom specialist,

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Anyhow, the chief here is determined to
keep the ruins open for viewing.

Just steer clear of the {{color id="0"}}stone slabs {{color id="-1"}}in the
Ring Ruins. Can't replace those!
