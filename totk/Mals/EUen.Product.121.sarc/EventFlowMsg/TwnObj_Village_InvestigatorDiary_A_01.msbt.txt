Surveying Shrines.

label: Talk_0002

The mysterious ruins that appeared due
to the Upheaval—with strange, dome-like
protrusions—we're calling "shrines."
They are believed to be from the Zonai
civilization, but exact details regarding
these shrines are unknown.
When observing shrines as well as fallen
ruins, take note of their shape, the sky
above, and the {{color id="0"}}surrounding environment{{color id="-1"}}.

Surveying Chasms.

label: Talk_0004

Large holes appeared all over the world
after the Upheaval. They release {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}
and are known as chasms.
Gloom is physically harmful to people.
Direct contact should be avoided.

If the effects of gloom are making you feel
ill, {{color id="0"}}evacuate from the chasm{{color id="-1"}} immediately.

Before entering any chasm, be sure to ask
permission from Josha, the leader of the
chasm surveys.

Our Team's Purpose.

---
label: Talk_0003

We of the Zonai Survey Team were
founded and tasked by Princess Zelda to
study ruins and ancient documents.
Through the lens of archaeological
understanding, it is her hope that we will
uncover the deep history of Hyrule.
Due to the Upheaval, many ruins from
the Zonai civilization came crashing down
from the sky.
We have known very little of the Zonai,
but we may now have evidence that their
culture once flourished in the sky above.
Our chief executive is Tauro, the first
individual in the world to find a clue to
deciphering Zonai scripts.
Our current surveys are wholly focused on
learning more about the Zonai civilization.

Research results are shared out to
specialists at the base in Kakariko Village.
