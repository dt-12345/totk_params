remember to prepare your soft,

Hey, you!{{pageBreak}}It's REALLY dark down here. Not one bit

As one of the few sources of light, the

Dear Calip,
The influence of the Upheaval has spread
to the Zonai Ruins.
Did you see the pillar-shaped ruin in front
of this tent? There shouldn't be artifacts
of that kind around here. An anomaly.
And there's more. The rubble at the base
of the pillar opened, revealing a way
inside. A new discovery!
Naturally, I will be going inside to
investigate shortly.

Join me as soon as you can.

So as our resident {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} expert, I

Is the desert a harsh environment with
extreme temperature differences? Sure.
But a place of death? No!
The desert's the place where life truly
comes alive! A sandy sea of energy where
you can draw out all of your power.

where I first dined on a dish made with
fire fruit.
I felt my {{color id="0"}}strength light up{{color id="-1"}} like a flambé.
Monsters I struggled against before fell
before me like flies!
I'd never felt such joy, such strength!
Then the desert heat overwhelmed me,
and I collapsed in a heap.

your strength, it {{color id="0"}}doesn't offer any

light than I did after my brightcap dish.

"The dragon ring slumbers in the

The Zonai glyphs carved into the stone
slab read:

"The dragon ring slumbers in the
labyrinth's depths. Wake it, and ye
shall receive due compensation."
Tauro deciphered them for us but has
since run off to another newly discovered
ruin for further study.
Writing frankly, I see his absence as an
opportunity. Any discoveries that may lie
within will all be credited to me!
My name will be forever tied to solving
the mysteries of the Zonai civilization!

an endless supply of bitter cold.

a note into that slab, couldn't they have
etched a few hints in there too?

entrance to the site, anyway?

In the hours since my discovery, I've tried
touching, hitting, and yelling at the relic,
but it remains unresponsive.
I'm starting to fear that I may not unravel

It took us two days to reach this isolated
island. Though the ruins stood before us,
we were too exhausted to explore.
Though weary, Tauro was able to decipher
the Zonai writing on the stone slab:

"The dragon ring slumbers in the
labyrinth's depths. Wake it, and ye
shall receive due compensation."
While his translation provided me with
renewed vigor, Tauro shortly thereafter
fell ill with fatigue.
After seeing him off on his way home,
I swore to tackle the ruins myself.

The {{color id="0"}}acorns{{color id="-1"}} and {{color id="0"}}nuts{{color id="-1"}} I have prepared to
