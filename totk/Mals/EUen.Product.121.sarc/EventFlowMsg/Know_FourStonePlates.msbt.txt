They're all so high up...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Heh. {{delay8}}They're only the most amazing
sight to see in Hyrule.{{pageBreak}}Of all the ruins that fell everywhere,
these ring-shaped wonders are only in
this village. Five of them!
They've found a {{color id="0"}}stone slab with Zonai
writing{{color id="-1"}} in four of the ruins.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Those ancient messages are the main
reason I came to this village!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Heh. {{delay8}}They're only the most amazing

these ring-shaped wonders are only in

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The problem is...{{delay8}}I have an extreme fear
of heights. My legs start shaking if I'm
even on the second floor of a house.
And every Ring Ruin fell somewhere
high up...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}One of the ruins is floating above part
of the village, so at least I can see it
from below. 
The other four though? Forget about it.
I can't even get close.{{pageBreak}}I wish I could find out {{color id="0"}}what's on the stone
slabs {{color id="-1"}}in each of those ruins...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The problem is...{{delay8}}I have an extreme fear
of heights. My legs start shaking if I'm
even on the second floor of a house.
And every Ring Ruin fell somewhere
high up...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}A survey-team member told me what was
on the stone slab in the ruin that used to
be off-limits.
But what's on each of the {{color id="0"}}slabs in the
other four Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}? My curiosity's
killing me!

---
label: Talk_00_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll be checking out the shops around
here. If you see me again, say hello!

---
label: 0002
---
I read what's on a slab.

---
label: Talk_01_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So did you visit the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}} I would
if I wasn't scared of heights.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}No one is allowed to visit the one ruin
that's floating above the village.{{pageBreak}}But if you've read one of the {{color id="0"}}slabs{{color id="-1"}} in any
of the{{color id="0"}} other four Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, tell me what
it says!

label: Talk_01_28

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Did you visit the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}} I would if I
wasn't scared of heights.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}A member of the survey team told me
what was written on the slab in the
Ring Ruin that floats above the village.{{pageBreak}}But if you've read one of the slabs in any
of the other four Ring Ruins, tell me
what it says!

---
label: Talk_01_02

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}With all those Ring Ruins falling out of the
sky, you'd hope just one more would have
the decency to float near the ground.
But no. {{color id="0"}}All four of the other ruins{{color id="-1"}} landed
way up high. I take one step up towards
them and break out in a cold sweat.
It's not fair! I want to know what {{color id="0"}}those
stone slabs say{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_01_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's great that you can see the {{color id="0"}}floating
Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}from relatively close, even if
it is sealed off.
But why do {{color id="0"}}the other four{{color id="-1"}} have to be
so distressingly high up?

I just want to know {{color id="0"}}what's written on
their stone slabs{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_01_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You'd think some of the{{color id="0"}} Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}would
have landed close to the ground...{{pageBreak}}But, no, every single one had to fall way
up high. Ugh, heights are the worst.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The researchers told me what the {{color id="0"}}slab{{color id="-1"}}
in the floating Ring Ruin said, but {{color id="0"}}I wish
I knew the contents of the other four{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_01_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can get a good look at the floating ruins,
and they told me what the slab inside
it said...
But I'm still frustrated that the other
{{color id="0"}}four Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} are up so high.

---
label: Talk_01_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What?!{{delay8}} You went to see them for me?{{pageBreak}}So...{{delay8}}what did they say?

---
label: Talk_01_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}You had a chance to see more?{{delay8}}
Wh-what was written on them?

---
label: Talk_01_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So, {{delay8}}uh... {{delay8}}Whenever you're ready...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh.{{delay8}} So you don't have a slab to tell me
about, huh?{{pageBreak}}If you tell me what's on each one of
those, I'll give you a reward.{{pageBreak}}Maybe...{{delay8}}something special I take with
me whenever I travel.

---
label: Talk_01_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Well, {{delay8}}I...{{delay8}} How do I say this...{{delay8}} You told me
that already.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I'm happy you tried.{{delay8}} Thank you!{{pageBreak}}Just let me know if you find out what's on
the slabs in the remaining ruins.

---
label: Talk_01_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Back in ancient Hyrule, people called
"sages" protected the kingdom... I see...{{delay8}}
How fascinating.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I bet those sages were nearly as strong
and wise as Princess Zelda herself.

---
label: Talk_01_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There were once people blessed by wind,
fire, water, and lightning...{{delay8}}as well as time
and light.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}And these people used "secret stones" to
amplify their powers... Wow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They must have had some pretty amazing
rocks way back when, huh?

---
label: Talk_01_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So in this ancient battle, the king and
all the sages fought the Demon King, but
they couldn't defeat him.
Still, they tried to leave a glimmer of hope
behind for the people of the future—
for us.
That's really something.{{delay8}} Huh.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}H-hey, you don't think the Upheaval is
some kind of sign of the Demon King's
resurrection, do you?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Ha...ha... {{delay8}}It c-{{delay8}}can't be, right? I must be
overthinking things.

---
label: Talk_01_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So it's not enough to be exceptional—
you need a secret stone to be a sage...{{delay15}}
Or so it seems, at least.{{pageBreak}}But what is a secret stone?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If it's that special, I'm sure its beauty
would put a diamond to shame.

---
label: Talk_01_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you for telling me about that slab!{{delay8}}
Truly fascinating stuff.{{pageBreak}}Just {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="NumOfNotToldPlates" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} left. I can only imagine what
discoveries lie in store.

---
label: Talk_01_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks so much for that!{{pageBreak}}Only {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="NumOfNotToldPlates" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}left. What secrets do you think
we'll learn?

---
label: Talk_01_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}I feel bad about asking you to find all this
out for me, since you're sightseeing too...{{pageBreak}}But we're so close now. I need to know
what each one of the slabs say!

---
label: Talk_01_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Y'know, {{delay8}}you're a good kid to take the
time to tell me about all this.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I'd never be able to take a look at it all
myself with my fear of heights.

---
label: Talk_01_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So that was the fourth one?{{delay8}} I see...

---
label: Talk_01_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Wait a second.{{pageBreak}}If you look at all of these slab messages
together...don't they sort of read like
{{color id="0"}}one single message{{color id="-1"}}?
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}You don't think...{{delay8}} Could the {{color id="0"}}rest{{color id="-1"}} of the
message be on a slab in the floating
Ring Ruin?!
But why?{{delay15}} Hmm...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh, this is impossible. {{delay8}}Trying to figure this
stuff out is making my head hurt.

---
label: Talk_01_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Wait a second.


If you put all that together with what the
survey-team member told me about the
slate in the floating Ring Ruin...
it all forms a {{color id="0"}}single message{{color id="-1"}}! {{delay8}}So this
sage Mineru...is offering us some sort
of clue to...{{delay15}} Hmm...{{pageBreak}}Ngh...{{delay15}} {{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Oh, I give up. I can't do this.{{pageBreak}}All this puzzle-solving stuff makes my
head hurt.

---
label: Talk_01_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, well. At the end of the day, I learned
a little something about our history.{{pageBreak}}Thank you for everything!{{pageBreak}}From one sightseer to another, I'd like
to reward you with one of my personal
favorite travel necessities.

---
label: Talk_01_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those are {{color id="0"}}thunderwing butterflies{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I caught these unusual insects on my
travels through the Faron region. They
only come out in the rain!
You can boil them with monster parts to
make an elixir that grants you resistance
to electricity.
Remember that! It'll come in handy on
your travels, take it from me.{{delay8}} All right,
then, I'll see you around!

---
label: Talk_01_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Your pouch is full!


Darn it. I was going to give you the {{color id="0"}}three
thunderwing butterflies {{color id="-1"}}I caught in Faron{{delay8}}.{{pageBreak}}I do want to thank you,{{delay8}} so come back
when you have the space to take 'em!

---
label: Talk_01_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You free up space in your pouch?{{pageBreak}}Then here's what I wanted to give you!

---
label: Talk_01_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Your pouch is still full, there.{{pageBreak}}I was hoping to give you the {{color id="0"}}three
thunderwing butterflies{{color id="-1"}} I caught in Faron.{{pageBreak}}Come back when you've made room!

---
label: Talk_01_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} You know what's written on the
stone slates?{{delay8}} That's amazing. I could
never climb to such a high, uh...height.
I have so much respect for you.{{pageBreak}}So, uh...{{delay8}} Wh...{{delay8}}what did they say?
