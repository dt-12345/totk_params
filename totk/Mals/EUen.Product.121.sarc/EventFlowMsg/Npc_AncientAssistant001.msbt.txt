---
label: Talk_4019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I know that one! It's {{color id="0"}}monster extract{{color id="-1"}}!


You mix Hylian rice, Goron spice, and
monster extract to make {{color id="0"}}monster curry{{color id="-1"}}!

See? I memorized that one already.

---
label: Talk_4020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, I'm sorry! That was incorrect. The
correct answer is the Sheikah!

I'm a Sheikah, and so are the people
working in the research lab up the hill,
as well as those living in Kakariko Village.
Remember that well!

---
label: Talk_4025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}That's certainly true. Though the specific
answer I was looking for is "cooking
during the blood moon."
Though when the {{color id="0"}}moon is red{{color id="-1"}}, monsters
are resurrected, so mind your
surroundings when you cook!

---
label: Talk_4026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Very well done!


The sword that seals the darkness is
also called the {{color id="0"}}Master Sword{{color id="-1"}}. Keep that
in mind!

---
label: Talk_4022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hm, that's an interesting answer. When
you bring ingredients to a cold region,
they do freeze.
They don't turn into treats, but they do
gain a {{color id="0"}}heat-resisting{{color id="-1"}} effect when frozen!

---
label: Talk_4023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}That's correct! The answer is an oracle.
Well done, Karin!

Although it took you a moment to recall
that, you should know that nowadays,
your other answers might have been valid!
Stables and newspapers are a rich source
of information, after all.

---
label: Talk_4024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Excellent! Well done, remembering that!


{{color id="0"}}Monster parts{{color id="-1"}} can only be used in making
{{color id="0"}}elixirs{{color id="-1"}}. Put them in your cooking, and it'll
spoil the food, so be careful.

---
label: Talk_4027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Close! The answer is "the Champions."


The Divine Beasts are the machines built
by the Sheikah.

You certainly know a lot! Excellent,
Sefaro!

---
label: Talk_4028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Your answers earned you full marks!
I see you've been studying, Sefaro.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}These days, it's extra important to teach

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Speaking of cooking, {{delay8}}your homemade
curry was a hit with the kids.

Where did you find such clothing?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Professor Link, you always surprise me!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The element of surprise is fundamental to
learning as well.

I must devote myself to becoming a
teacher who can surprise and delight
the children.

---
label: Talk_5016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh dear, I'm sorry. I'm going on about
my own endeavors.

Anyhow, I must say that your appearance
was delightfully astonishing.

And aside from that, I've been meaning to
express my gratitude to you.

---
label: Talk_5017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thank you for making monster curry for
the children!

I'm sure they'll remember it well, since it
was such a hands-on experience.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, a teacher's job extends beyond
the classroom.

No matter when or where, if you see
children, you have a responsibility
to them.
