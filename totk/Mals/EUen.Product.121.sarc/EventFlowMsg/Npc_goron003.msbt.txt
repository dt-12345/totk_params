{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sick of trying to get customers to
go inside...

It's not nearly hot enough for {{color id="0"}}fireproof
gear{{color id="-1"}}. Nobody's gonna buy it right now.

Fireproof gear?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Up until a couple years ago, Death
Mountain was super active and erupting.

It's the reason Goron City was so hot and
flowing with lava.

A little Hylian like you would've been
cooked to a crisp!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So we always sold {{color id="0"}}fireproof gear{{color id="-1"}} for folks
such as yourself, but now the only places
hot enough for it are the {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}.
Our sales have hit rock bottom...

so I still get mixed up.

The previous innkeep, Tray, is retiring,
and I've taken on the business.

But if I can't even remember what kinda
shop I'm runnin', I've got a long way
to go...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But I'll do a good job, eventually! I made
a promise to Tray. That's why, sir...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Sir, is this your first time hearing about
Goron massages?{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}We administer the massage on a hard
rock bed,{{delay8}} and we apply a lot of pressure
to loosen the muscles.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But it doesn't hurt one bit.{{delay8}} Just lie back
and relax.

You'll wake up refreshed, rejuvenated,
and restored! The three magic Rs!
