{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello there! {{delay15}}I...{{delay15}} Oh.{{delay15}} Oh my.

---
label: Greeting_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I don't know how to say this properly,
so I'll just come out with it—{{delay8}}you strike
me as an extraordinary fellow.
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I should know. I was once a marvel of
a man. Strong as an ox, training hours a
day to master the ways of war...
Then my life took a left turn, and I ended
up here, hawking my wares on the side of
the road.
Well, no matter how rusty my sword skills
get, I'm still a good judge of people.

Oh... {{delay8}}That was probably more backstory
than you wanted!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Sorry about that. I suppose I just got
caught up in your aura.

---
label: Greeting_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So you walk around like that all day,
just exuding strength and vigor?

Tell you what! If you ever want an
old swordsman's advice, I'm happy to
share what I know.

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}A lot of weapons decayed after the
Upheaval. Most folks don't know what
to do about it...
But I figured it out!{{pageBreak}}If you combine {{color id="0"}}monster materials{{color id="-1"}} and a
{{color id="0"}}decayed weapon{{color id="-1"}}—boom! Much improved.{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Great idea, right? Just a little tip from me
to you, free of charge.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you combine {{color id="0"}}monster materials{{color id="-1"}} and a

something you can use!

---
label: GoalPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="0"}}Shields{{color id="-1"}} aren't just for blocking an attack
or defending yourself.

You can also reflect attacks, creating
openings to attack your opponent.
Your shield can do offense AND defense!{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I've even heard some folks ride their
{{color id="0"}}shields{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}surf {{color id="-1"}}down hills. Wild!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Reflecting an attack can create an

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}The {{color id="0"}}materials{{color id="-1"}} used to make {{color id="0"}}equipment{{color id="-1"}}
like shields and weapons give them
different characteristics.
For example, anything {{color id="0"}}made of metal {{color id="-1"}}is
going to attract {{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}}. Zap!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hearing that tell-tale rumble of thunder is
a good reminder to take off any metal
{{color id="0"}}gear{{color id="-1"}} as quick as you can.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Even the best {{color id="0"}}weapons{{color id="-1"}} break if you keep
using 'em.

But did you know some {{color id="0"}}weapons{{color id="-1"}} are at
their strongest right before they break?

It's almost like they're pushing
themselves to wring out the last
scrap of power they have.

That's where you'll find the {{color id="0"}}Zora{{color id="-1"}}. They're
water folk. And if you need armor or
weapons, their blacksmiths are top-rate.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}But I bet even their weapons decayed
after the Upheaval.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Some folks say {{color id="0"}}weapons {{color id="-1"}}made out of
{{color id="0"}}wood {{color id="-1"}}are dull and fragile,{{delay15}} but it's all
about how you use 'em.
If you light one on {{color id="0"}}fire{{color id="-1"}} and chuck it at an
enemy? {{delay8}}Fwoom! {{delay8}}And if you're in the dark,
you can use it as a {{color id="0"}}torch{{color id="-1"}} in a pinch.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}You just need a bit of clever thinking.

weapon can light your way in the dark.{{delay15}}
Just gotta use your noggin!

label: BackRange_02

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}That appearance... {{delay15}}That demeanor...{{delay15}}
I can tell you're a man of great skill!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But even the {{color id="0"}}weapons {{color id="-1"}}of a master like
you won't last forever, so make sure you
always have back-ups.
Getting caught without a {{color id="0"}}weapon {{color id="-1"}}might be
the last mistake you ever make!
