{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}An {{color id="0"}}Energy Well {{color id="-1"}}can increase the {{color id="0"}}capacity{{color id="-1"}}

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Yes. {{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}Crystallized charges{{color id="-1"}} {{delay8}}are materials

It is unlikely you will find enough to
