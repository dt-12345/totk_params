{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}For you to come all this way, enduring the

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}The sand shroud settled on us some time
ago. We sent out patrols to try to
determine what was causing it, but...
A swarm of monsters—creatures called
Gibdos—suddenly appeared, attacked our
troops, and forced us to retreat.
The Gibdos have even made their way into
the town. As a result, everyone was
evacuated to this shelter for their safety.
As someone charged with protecting
Gerudo Town, I am ashamed at our
current situation.
