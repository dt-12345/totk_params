{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello again, Mr. Link! Been working

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello again, Mr. Link! There are lots of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}Look at this! I made it for fighting off
monsters. Pretty nifty, huh?{{pageBreak}}Our iron weapons {{color id="0"}}decayed{{color id="-1"}}, and there's a

a {{color id="0"}}rock{{color id="-1"}} to the end of a {{color id="0"}}long stick{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}With this weapon in my hand and the
Gerudo by my side, I'm not a bit scared

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Mr. Link, did you hear? Gerudo soldiers
came to aid us!{{pageBreak}}We've been barely scraping by with our

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I've never met any Gerudo before.
Those spears of theirs are beautifully

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Did you hear, Mr. Link?!{{delay8}}


Someone that looked like Princess Zelda

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}At least, that's what I heard. Pretty
important news, if it's true!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}It's a long way between here and

if I can spot {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} from here.{{pageBreak}}Who needs a {{color id="0"}}telescope{{color id="-1"}}? If I put enough
heart into it, my eyes will do what they've
got to!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}I don't need a telescope to help save

my eyes will be too.
I won't give up until she's safe!
