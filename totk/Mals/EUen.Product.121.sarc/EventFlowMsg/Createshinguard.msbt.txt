The lecturing...never stops.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}In summation, and to repeat myself, as an
attendant of Queen Yona, it is paramount
to demonstrate more self-awareness...
At all times and in every circumstance,
you must behave in a way that is in no
danger of reflecting poorly on her...

---
label: Createshinguard_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_00"}}Yes...{{delay8}} Yes...{{delay15}} I am ever reflecting on that...
{{delay15}}Indeed, your words ring true...

---
label: Createshinguard_1010
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hm?{{delay15}} Ah!{{delay15}} Sir Link!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Createshinguard_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh!{{delay15}} Sir Link!{{delay15}} Wherever are my manners?


I was not quick to notice you had graced
us with your presence. I am terribly sorry.

---
label: Createshinguard_1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Perhaps that is because you were so absorbed in
lecturing me...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Createshinguard_1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Honestly!{{delay8}} And the reason for that is your
lack of progress in the tasks you have
been entrusted with!
The {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}} we are to present to
Sir Link seems to be {{color id="0"}}stored in a sky fish{{color id="-1"}}...

{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Queen Yona kindly provided you with that
helpful information, yet you have done
nothing with it!

---
label: Createshinguard_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Y-yes, that is so...


I desperately searched the river for the
fish that ate the {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}but I returned
empty-handed.

---
label: Createshinguard_1035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Pure silliness. It is unlikely that the
{{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}} was placed in an actual
fish's stomach.
I suspect you should be thinking of the
{{color id="0"}}sky fish {{color id="-1"}}as a metaphor {{delay8}}leading to the
place where the helm is {{color id="0"}}hidden{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}You never listen closely to my guidance,
which often results in these ridiculous
misunderstandings.

---
label: Createshinguard_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}I... Eek!


{{size value="80"}}H-help me, Sir Link...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Createshinguard_near1001
---
My head is spinning...

---
label: Createshinguard_1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Understood, Chroma?


Queen Yona originally intended to search
for Sir Link's {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}} herself to present
to him in gratitude.
But someone insisted that she hand off
the task. "Leave it to me," that Zora said.
Who was it? Was it not...{{delay15}}you, Chroma?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Look... I understand being moved by
Queen Yona's kind spirit and the domain's
gratitude for Sir Link.
In truth, I have full faith in you and your
own kind spirit. That is why I am so hard
on you.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Ugh... She keeps repeating prior lectures.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But I was told that the {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}} is "stored in
the {{color id="0"}}sky fish{{color id="-1"}}"...

{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm...{{delay15}} {{color id="0"}}Sky fish{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} Fish...{{delay8}} F-I-S-H...{{delay15}} Oof, all of this
fish talk is making me famished.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Createshinguard_1055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}You mean to say...{{delay8}} You already found it?


To think the Zora helm was hidden in
the floating fish-shaped island...

---
label: Createshinguard_1055_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm...{{delay8}} Why do I feel {{delay8}}as though I am
overlooking something...

---
label: Createshinguard_near1002
---
The Zora helm...

---
label: Createshinguard_1060
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The Zora helm previously used in battle
was damaged beyond repair.

That means the information Queen Yona
found is the only key we have to repaying
our immense debt to Sir Link...

---
label: Createshinguard_1065
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Ah!{{delay8}} It is you! {{delay8}}Sir Link!{{delay8}} Is there something
we can help you with?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}You mean to say...{{delay8}} You already found the

---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Wait a moment...{{delay8}} Huh?!{{delay15}}


Sir Link! That thing upon your head...{{delay8}}
Is that not the {{color id="0"}}Zora helm{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Createshinguard_1070_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}To think it was hidden on a fish-shaped
island floating up in the sky...

---
label: Createshinguard_1075
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}So! The Zora helm was up in the sky!{{delay8}}
Meaning it was impossible for us to find
it from the start.
Thanks to you, Sir Link, our goal was
achieved, same as though we had
retrieved the helm for you ourselves.
Perhaps this means that Khira's lengthy
lectures will finally come to an end...

label: Createshinguard_1080

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Chroma...

---
label: Createshinguard_1081
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}This was intended to be our opportunity
to honor Sir Link for his contributions.
Instead, we caused trouble for him.
{{anim type="Angry_00"}}We have much to be sorry for! And yet...{{delay15}}
There it is. That inexplicable smirk upon
your face!
It seems it again falls on me to instruct
you in proper conduct for an attendant.
Listen carefully...

---
label: Createshinguard_1085
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}No...{{delay15}} It cannot be! I was so sure the
lectures would finally end!

---
label: Createshinguard_1090

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Enough tomfoolery!{{delay15}} I will not allow it!

---
label: Createshinguard_1095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}This cannot be happening...

---
label: Createshinguard_1100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You witnessed something unseemly.{{delay15}}
Worry not, I intend to give Chroma a
stern warning.
Sir Link...{{delay15}} If you so please, will you speak
with {{color id="0"}}Queen{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Yona{{color id="-1"}}?

Helm aside, {{color id="0"}}Queen Yona{{color id="-1"}} is earnestly
trying to repair your {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}As you are aware, the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}} should
prove quite useful on your journey.
