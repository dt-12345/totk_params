{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Urgh...{{delay8}} Are...{{delay8}} Are you here to help?{{pageBreak}}Please...{{delay8}} This is misery.{{delay8}} I'm covered in
{{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}{{delay15}}and I need a {{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}It's over for me.{{delay8}} All this {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}} *hack*
{{color id="0"}}Sundelion{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} If I only had a sundelion.

I've got one here.

Sorry, can't help.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ah!{{delay8}} I'm saved...{{delay8}} Thank you!

label: talk_1012

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Thank you, you're a real lifesaver!


{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}This area is riddled with gloom, {{delay8}}and
I stepped right into it.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}One touch of {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} will eat away at your
vitality.{{delay8}} Be careful to keep a safe distance.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If the gloom does get you, {{delay8}}you should
either {{color id="0"}}go up to the surface{{color id="-1"}} or use a
{{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}} as soon as you can.
I've heard rumors that the light of those
giant trees can help too...

label: talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Though I suppose that's neither here
nor there...

Because the gloom won't even have the
chance to do you in!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You'd walk away...{{delay8}}from someone in need?

label: talk_1031
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}But you...{{delay8}}don't have any {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}...

label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Some "hero" you are.{{delay8}} So heartless...
I feel my rage giving me strength!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey, be careful walking around down
here.{{delay15}} Everything's covered in {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
so try to watch your step.
If you do get any gloom on you, use a
{{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} The base should've told you
to always keep a few on hand.
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you don't have any, some time on the
surface should fix you up.{{delay8}} I hear those
glowing trees can help too, but I dunno...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Anyway, I hope Link comes through here
soon. {{delay8}}Pretending to be sick really takes it
out of you.

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Watch your step around here.{{delay8}} The place
is covered in {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}If you touch any,{{delay8}} you'll need a {{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}}
or some time on the surface.

I've heard that those big trees can help
with gloom too, but I haven't been able
to confirm that yet.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Anyway, I hope Link comes through here
before too long.{{delay8}} I really wanna get back
to the surface.
