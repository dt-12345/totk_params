{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Well, we meet again, friend!{{delay8}} You
really pulled me out of the fire back at
that Goron restaurant.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Since then, my hunt for this {{color id="0"}}mysterious{{color id="-1"}},
{{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}} has led me down here to
the Faron tropics.
I've been keepin' my ear to the ground in
{{color id="0"}}stables all across Hyrule{{color id="-1"}}, and the stories
all point in this direction.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And when I find that creature, hm...{{pageBreak}}Do I wanna make a steak out of it or chop
it up for a stew?{{delay15}} Decisions, decisions...

---
label: Greeting
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What is it? Ya hungry? Sorry, I don't have
any food on me right now.{{pageBreak}}I swore to myself that I wouldn't eat a
thing until I dined on that {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}
all the stables are talkin' about!

---
label: Greeting_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Huh? That's weird...

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}I just saw a {{color id="0"}}blue animal{{color id="-1"}} over there. You
think it's the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}} everyone's
goin' on about?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Nah, can't be.{{delay8}} It's too different from all
the stories.{{pageBreak}}Still, can't say I've ever seen a creature
quite like it.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'd love to get a taste of—{{delay15}} Er, a better
look at it...

---
label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I could've sworn I caught a glimpse of
that {{color id="0"}}little blue creature{{color id="-1"}} around here.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Hm... Hmmm...{{pageBreak}}Mmm... {{delay15}}Wonder how it tastes.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Still...{{delay8}}I don't see any trace of the
{{color id="0"}}rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}on the beach.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Go to any {{color id="0"}}stable{{color id="-1"}} and you'll hear rumors
about a {{color id="0"}}mysterious beast{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If I look at the common threads between
all {{color id="0"}}stable chatter{{color id="-1"}} I've heard...{{pageBreak}}it's clear that the beast's somewhere in
the {{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}} region.

---
label: RestPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If I take the road {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}, I'll come up on
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}No quicker way to get a bite to eat than
finding a settlement, after all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But that's a fishing town, and me? {{delay8}}I'm a
meat man!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}On top of that, I heard they got attacked
by {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}Yeah, think I'll steer clear.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If I take the road {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}, I'll come up on
{{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}No quicker way to get a good meal than
finding a settlement, after all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But that's a fishing town, and me? {{delay8}}I'm a
meat man!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I heard that the pirates are gone now,
so that's a plus, but...{{delay8}} Maybe there's a
hunting town I can visit instead.

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're hungry, it's best to look for a
settlement.{{delay15}} There's {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} down
the road to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}...
But it's been taken over by pirates. Worse
yet, it's a fishing town!{{pageBreak}}Full of pirates, no meat...{{delay15}} Yeah, I don't
think {{color id="0"}}Lurelin{{color id="-1"}}'s for me.

---
label: RestPoint_01_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're hungry, finding a settlement's a
quick way to get some good food.{{delay15}} Closest
option's {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}.
I'm not much of a seafood eater though.
I like my meat meaty.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Y'know...{{delay15}}whenever the rain puts a damper
on my adventures, my mind always
wanders to what I wanna eat.
You ever get a chance to see the
footprints of the {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}} in those
{{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}}? The pictures of 'em, I mean.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Anything that leaves tracks like that has
gotta be HUGE.{{pageBreak}}That's why I'm trying to keep my stomach
nice and empty for it!

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Based solely on the size of the {{color id="0"}}footprints{{color id="-1"}}
hanging at the {{color id="0"}}stables{{color id="-1"}}...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}this {{color id="0"}}rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}has gotta be massive!{{pageBreak}}Tell ya what—if I find it, I'll split it with
ya. Just make sure you've got room in
your stomach!

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've heard every rumor the stables have
to offer, and I'm sure of it—the beast is
here in {{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}}.
No need to go way out east to {{color id="0"}}Lurelin {{color id="-1"}}for
a bite.{{delay8}} That critter's close, and I plan on
cooking it up.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}How do I know? Call it intuition.{{delay8}} Or maybe
just my nose for meat!{{delay15}} Either way, I've
got its scent now.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I smell it...{{delay15}} *sniff* Yeah, I smell it!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}rumored beast {{color id="-1"}}is close by.{{delay8}} My nose
is never wrong!

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You might've already picked up on this,
but I love meat.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Used to go around selling it, but every
time I handed it over to a customer,
my stomach growled something fierce.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's when I realized I'd rather eat it
than give it away.

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Steaks, skewers... I want 'em all! {{delay8}}Fish and
veggies may be enough for some, but only
meaty meat satisfies my tummy!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Some meats you can't buy in a store.
You have to find them for yourself out in
the wild.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm like a treasure hunter, but instead of
precious jewels, I find precious flavors.{{delay8}}
Mezer, the meat hunter!

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Find meat, eat meat. {{delay8}}That's my
carnivorous credo!

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}There's somethin' kinda romantic about
hunting the unknown.{{delay8}} But just what sort
of creature is this {{color id="0"}}rumored beast{{color id="-1"}}?
There's so much we don't know. {{delay8}}What
does it look like? {{delay8}}How does it live?{{pageBreak}}Does it taste better as a skewer, stew,
or roast?{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}No, no, you don't gotta tell me. I know it's
terrible that's where my brain goes.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you're going to take life, you need to
be willing to nurture it too.{{pageBreak}}If this beast's one of the last of its kind,
I'm not about to eat it, no matter how
much I love meat.
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I'd wanna help build an environment that
would allow it to thrive and reproduce.
Maybe then I'd sample one.

label: BackRange_02_2

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}A {{color id="0"}}mysterious beast{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay8}}Mm! I wanna taste
the mystery meat!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But anyone who dares to take life must
be willing to nurture it too.{{pageBreak}}If this beast is one of the last of its kind,
then I'm not about to eat it.{{pageBreak}}We've got to create an environment that
would allow their population to grow
before we even think about that.

up a monster meal!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}That was horrifying.{{delay8}} I thought I was
dead meat!
