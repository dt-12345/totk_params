{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Cece set up her own Cece-brand line.
It proves what a fantastically avant-garde,

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}That's right. The quickest way to prove
you're a man of culture and taste is to
outfit yourself in {{color id="0"}}Cece-brand{{color id="-1"}} clothing.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You could also try {{color id="0"}}dyeing{{color id="-1"}} your outfit at

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Say, have you heard the rumors about

they've been happening in that silo!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? Why there? There's nothing

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That's as much as I could get out of

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Oh my! {{delay8}}Why would some vagabond have a

Simply outrageous, I tell you!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Then again... Cece hands those out at her

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}It's too bad Cece decided to withdraw

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That's the one. {{delay8}}What I heard is that a
