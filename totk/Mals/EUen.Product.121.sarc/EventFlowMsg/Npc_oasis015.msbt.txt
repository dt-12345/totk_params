It's a must-have for any fashionable voe

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq"}}Vasaaq!{{delay8}} Ah, that caught your eye, huh?
I knew it!

The sand shroud may be gone, but
the heat isn't going anywhere. Such is
desert life!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I sell one of the latest fashion crazes
straight from Gerudo Town!

If you're after the {{color id="0"}}desert voe headband{{color id="-1"}},
you've come to the right place. It used to
be hard for voe to get their hands on it!

---
label: talk1417
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That was a close one earlier...{{delay8}} You didn't
mess up your clothes, did you?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Hey, changing up your look is a good way
to refresh your mood! Think about it!

---
label: talk1408
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The sand shroud has completely cleared
up!{{delay8}} Seems like as good a time as any to
add to your wardrobe, don't you think?

---
label: talk1407
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Not only is what I sell a fashionable
choice, it's also great at staving off the
desert heat!

---
label: talk1409
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And even if you've already got one, why
settle for just that one when you could
get another in a {{color id="0"}}different color{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: talk1425
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We're all sold out right now, but we'll
probably restock soon.

Come back and visit us again, OK? There
is no such thing as too many {{color id="0"}}different
color{{color id="-1"}} varieties!

---
label: talk1421
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A {{color id="0"}}desert voe headband{{color id="-1"}} really is a must!
Not only is it stylish but wearing it takes
some of the bite out of the desert heat!

A different color?

label: talk1411

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Using dye to change the color of clothes
is a big thing with young vai traveling
around Hyrule.
If you're interested, there's a store in
{{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} in the eastern edge of
Hyrule—the {{color id="0"}}Kochi Dye Shop{{color id="-1"}}.
Hateno Village used to be a quiet,
peaceful little town, you know...

But now it's a tourist hotspot. Some
folks consider it the center for all
things fashionable!

that secret!
{{size value="80"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The headband you just bought is only one part of
the desert voe series. There's also a spaulder

But you have to go to a special place to get them.
Have you heard of the store Fashion Passion in
Gerudo Town?
Well, the secret shop is located behind that store!{{size value="100"}}
