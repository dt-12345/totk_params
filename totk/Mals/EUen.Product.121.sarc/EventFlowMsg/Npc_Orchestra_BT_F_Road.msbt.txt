{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I'm gonna go back to the Stable Trotters
and practice even harder!

Imagine making Haite and everyone else
smile with just a few notes of music...{{delay8}}
That's the kind of flute player I wanna be.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But where have Mastro and the others
gone? How am I supposed to find them?

I heard a rumor that the Stable Trotters
disbanded, but there's no way our
conductor would give up on his music.
Maybe he's at a {{color id="0"}}stable somewhere{{color id="-1"}},
waiting for me to come back.

all over the world.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm glad I decided to go back to the
Stable Trotters, but...

I have no idea where our conductor,
Mastro, led everyone.
