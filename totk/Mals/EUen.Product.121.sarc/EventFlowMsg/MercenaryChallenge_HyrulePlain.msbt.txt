Taking out monsters {{color id="0"}}south of here by

We're close. Be careful.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The last time we met was at Hyrule Castle,
if I remember right.

---
label: Talk1069
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I'm Hoz, captain of squad one of the
monster-control crew.

After our search for Princess Zelda at
Hyrule Castle, I returned to my monster-
fighting duties.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}At the moment, we're closing in on a
monster stronghold up ahead.

Once we {{color id="0"}}approach{{color id="-1"}} their base, we'll wait
for the right opportunity and then {{color id="0"}}launch
our attack{{color id="-1"}}.
{{anim type="Understand_01"}}I apologize if I'm being presumptuous,
but running into you here feels like fate...

I must say, nothing would be more
encouraging than to have you, Hyrule's
best swordsman, assist us.
{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}If we work together, I'm sure we could
bring peace back to this land.

label: Talk1005

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}My monster-control crew is in the middle
of taking out monsters that have dug in
around here.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}I don't feel good about hanging back like
this while they wade into battle...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But if they're defeated, someone has
to be able to help the survivors.

So I'm giving orders from here.


{{anim type="Understand_01"}}But, Link, if you could join them and add
your considerable strength to theirs...
I'd feel far better.

But...I can't seem to find them.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Link, how do I even begin to thank you?


Because of you, we can head to our next
