Now what are they up to?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm? Another Hylian, huh?


I commend you and those merchants
for making it here under these
abnormal conditions...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But the area south of {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}} is
covered by the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} right now, so
visibility is extremely low.
Then there are the eyewitness reports of
{{color id="0"}}strange monsters{{color id="-1"}}. I won't think any less
of you if you call off your trip here.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Besides, this oasis is under the protection
of us Gerudo soldiers, so you know it's
a safe place to rest and relax!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}The area south of this oasis is cloaked in
a {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, and there's no end to the
reports of {{color id="0"}}strange monsters {{color id="-1"}}nearby.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But you're safe here in {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That's because our protection is flawless!{{delay8}}
So you can relax and unwind from your
travels without a care in the world!

Hyah!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful"}}Urgh... These monsters are relentless...{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}Where{{color id="-1"}} are these swarms coming from?!

It's important to stay alert.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Let me thank you again for helping us
clear those monsters out of here!

Some of my fellow guards were slacking
off before, but ever since the battle,
everyone's regained their focus!
We won't be letting any more monsters
into this oasis!

{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}So, go relax and let the stresses of battle
melt away. We have things covered
around here.

label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}The battle against the Gibdos has
renewed our focus. We won't be letting
any more monsters into this place.
So, go relax and let the stresses of battle
melt away.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Some of the guards were slacking off
before, but they've all regained their
focus since the battle!
And now with the sand shroud gone, we
can see threats coming from farther away!

We won't be letting any more monsters
into this oasis, that's for sure.

{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So, you have nothing to worry about. Go
relax, and let the strain of battle melt off
of you.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I've got nothing to say to the likes of you.
Get out of my sight.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A member of the Yiga Clan? What are you
doing here?

It would not be appropriate for me to cut
you down without a warning, so consider
this the warning.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Leave at once.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}How dare you show yourself here.


If it were up to me, I would attack you
without a second thought.

But people come here to rest, and I do
not want to disrupt that peace if I don't
have to.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}So leave.{{delay15}} Immediately.

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You are not welcome here.


Get lost before I misplace my spear.{{delay15}}
In you.

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}It's pretty foolish for you to show up
here, Yiga.

If it weren't for the innocents around who
might flinch at the sight of blood, I would
cut you down right now.
Leave before I change my mind.

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I don't know what you think you're doing,
but you are not welcome.

Leave at once, or I will make you regret
your decision to come here.
