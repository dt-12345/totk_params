{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Arrogant_00"}}I'll dig all day every day if {{color id="0"}}marbled rock
roast{{color id="-1"}}'s the reward.

But no matter how much I dig, I keep
finding stuff I don't understand. And
none of it tastes good.
Time to cleanse the ol' palate with more
{{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Arrogant_00"}}No matter how much I dig, I keep finding
stuff I don't understand. And none of
it tastes good.
So I'm cleanin' my palate with this
{{color id="0"}}marbled rock roast{{color id="-1"}}. It's the only thing
worth eatin' these days.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}If those things that showed up around
here really are vehicles...

then maybe they were used by our most
noble ancestors!

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Still, if something was gonna turn up, I'd rather it
were ore instead...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}
