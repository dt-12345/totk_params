You're in luck! I'm selling my very
super-special ring garlands.

I make them to look like the Ring Ruins.
Maybe they'll bring people together like
never before. Like the ruins here have!
I've opened my shop under the tree in
front of the chief's house. We aren't open
all the time, so keep an eye out!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You'll know you're in the right place
when you see the adorable shopkeeper.
Tee-hee!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh... I see. Even though you came aaall
the way to town?

If you change your mind, try the shop by
the chief's house. It isn't open all the
time, but it has the best souvenirs!

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mother... I'm sorry I don't come to visit more often.


I want to, but {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}said we mustn't go
near the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}closest to your grave. I don't
know why.
Paya—I mean, the chief—doesn't know either.
She says she's worried.

It must be hard to be an adult, huh?{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk_25
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mother... I'm sorry I don't come to visit more often.


It's because Paya—I mean, the chief—is hard at work
under the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}closest to your grave.

Wait a little longer, OK?{{size value="100"}}

---

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mother... Cottla, Father, and I are all well.


The path to your grave was blocked for a while, but
Paya—she's the chief now—said we can go through.

We can visit you properly from now on!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Is everything all right? Oh, I know what's

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Mother used to say that people who
spend lots of time in the rain are trying
to hide something.
What are you trying to hide? Your
footsteps? Or maybe...your tears?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Just kidding! It's a joke!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}For some reason, Koko always—I mean,
I always feel sad on rainy days.

---
label: talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Rain might be good for hiding tears, but
you shouldn't need to hide. Let tears
flow. Use rain for hiding other things.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just kidding! About hiding things, I mean.
It's important not to feel ashamed of
your tears.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know, for some reason, I always feel
sad on rainy days.

label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You should mark your visit to the Ring

How about a {{color id="0"}}ring garland{{color id="-1"}}? They're made
with lots of love, and they're only {{color id="0"}}five

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're decorations I made using flowers

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}After the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} fell from the sky,
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}got much busier.

It's like we're more a part of everyone's
lives now, and they're more a part of
our village!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}So I started making garlands that look
like the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, hoping they'd bring
people together even more.
I want them to make lots of people happy,
so I'm only charging a little bit.

That's right—only {{color id="0"}}five rupees {{color id="-1"}}each. Well?
