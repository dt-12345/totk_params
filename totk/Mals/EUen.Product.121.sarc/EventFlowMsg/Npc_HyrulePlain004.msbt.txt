That thing is...rattling...

So shiny and golden...

I want a ride on that.

Someday I'll go up there...

---
label: Near_02

I hope I can see it today!

label: Near_03

Eep! I'm gonna get wet!

Come back out, sun...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah! Welcome, mister!

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}There aren't many clouds right now, so
you can get a really good look at the
land in the sky!

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Even with the rain, it's so bright out that
you can still see the land in the sky!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's all dark and dreary now, so you can
barely see the land in the sky.

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's so dreary out now that you can barely
see the land in the sky.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Outta my way! I gotta go look at the
kingdom of the sky!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's really easy to slip in the rain, and
lightning can be dangerous...

That's why my grandpa told me good kids
take shelter when it rains!

Come on, mister, let's go find a tree to
hide under!

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It's time for good kids to go to sleep.
No more looking at {{color id="0"}}the land in the sky{{color id="-1"}}...
because I'm a good kid...{{delay15}}I guess.{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}
If you come back tomorrow, will you help
me look for {{color id="0"}}stuff that fell from up there{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry, it's time to say good night. We'll
talk again tomorrow!{{pageBreak}}If I don't sleep lots and grow up quick, I'll
never be able to go to the land in the sky!

label: Talk_17

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sleep"}}When I grow up...I'm going for sure...{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh... Is this your first time here, mister?
Welcome! This is {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, I gotta know...

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Are YOU looking for {{color id="0"}}stuff that fell from
the sky {{color id="-1"}}too?!

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You're looking for {{color id="0"}}stuff that fell from the
sky{{color id="-1"}} too, right, mister?

---
label: 0006
---
Fell from the sky?

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}You don't know?!{{pageBreak}}Look up there—{{delay8}}there's an island floating
in the sky! You see it too, right?

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sometimes when I'm looking at the sky,
a big {{color id="0"}}box{{color id="-1"}} falls down from that island!

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I told you already! Weren't you listening?
I'm talking about the {{color id="0"}}boxes{{color id="-1"}} that fall from
the sky!

---
label: Talk_32
---
When I'm looking at the sky like this,
sometimes these big {{color id="0"}}boxes{{color id="-1"}} come
craaashing down!

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, there! Look, look!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And that means a sky person's gotta be
dropping them!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I always knew there was a kingdom in the
sky, and I've always dreamed of going up
there to play with all the sky animals!
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I'm still little, so I'm not allowed to go
too far away...

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I wanna hurry and be all grown up like
you, mister. Then I can go up there!

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}I wonder if another box will fall from the
sky... {{delay8}}What do you think it's like up there?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}*sigh* I hope I can go there someday.
I wanna play with all the sky animals!

---
label: 0007
---
Gotta go.

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Fine, then! {{delay8}}Looking for stuff that {{color id="0"}}fell from
the sky {{color id="-1"}}is more fun by myself anyway!

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'll see you later, then! Once I'm all
grown up, let's meet again in the
kingdom of the sky!

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Do you think you could go into the sky if
you had lots of {{color id="0"}}big balloons{{color id="-1"}} like the one
on the {{color id="0"}}other side of the pond{{color id="-1"}}?
