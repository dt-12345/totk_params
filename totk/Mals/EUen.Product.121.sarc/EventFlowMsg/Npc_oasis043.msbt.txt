If you're planning to help protect the
chief, you'd best keep your energy up
with a hearty meal!

---
label: near0000
---
Wow...

---
label: near0001
---
Fresh mushrooms!

---
label: talk0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So you're the voe the chief has given
special permission to?

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Why would the chief make a special exception for
you, hmm? I wonder...{{color id="-1"}}

{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ooh, but I love a good mystery!


In any case, if you're planning to help the
chief, you've got to keep your energy up!{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And mushrooms are perfect for that.
Do you have any idea how common they
are and how many nutrients they contain?
You should buy some—either to eat right
now or to save for later!

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Mushrooms are perfect for keeping your
energy up! You can find them almost
anywhere, and they're nutrient rich!
Get some for yourself—for now and
for later!

If you're running a little short on {{color id="0"}}rupees{{color id="-1"}}
but can't pass on these mushrooms, you
could always sell me something first.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh? You aren't done?


I thought you were going to head out,
but OK.

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}This voe seems pretty indecisive. That certainly
can't be why the chief has made a special exception
for him...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll make sure to get more delicious
mushrooms in stock soon, so come back
and see me again!
{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}This voe really has excellent taste and clearly cares
about his health. Maybe that's why the chief made a
special exception for him?{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0000
---
Buy from me.

---
label: 0001
---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you've got a little time, why not take
a look at my selection!

All the mushrooms I have are freshly
picked!{{delay8}} They're nice and tender!

---
label: talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Stop by anytime. I'm happy to see what
items you might be looking to sell.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The chief is quite the vai. Good luck
keeping up with her!

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Is it true that you and the chief stopped
the sand shroud together?

How did it go? Were you two perfectly in
sync every step of the way?

Thank you for helping her! She deserves
all the support you can give!

Um... Ahem?

label: Com_Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}What are you gonna sell me?

---
label: Com_Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}For that... If {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} is OK
with you, I'll buy it. Deal?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso.{{delay8}} What about the rest?

label: Com_Talk_04

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh, did you change your mind?
That's too bad.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Take your time—no rush!

---
label: Com_Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That? OK, how many do you want to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}So {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them? How about
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That's not really my kind of thing...
Maybe you can sell me something else?

---
label: Com_Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hey! Hey! I'm not buying anything right
off your back!{{delay8}} If you want to sell it, you're
gonna have to change out of it first!

---
label: Com_Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}One will get you {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}.
Wanna sell it?

---
label: Com_Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}All {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of yours? In that case, does
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} sound good?

---
label: Com_Talk_50

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}One is {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}. What do you
think? Pretty good price?

---
label: Com_Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You are quite the indecisive voe,
aren't you...

---
label: Com_Talk_02b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso!

---
label: Com_Talk_02c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso. What do you say? Want to sell
me a few more things?

---
label: Com_Talk_02d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Sarqso...{{delay8}} It is a strange day when I am
filling my stock from a voe in the middle
of town...

---
label: Com_Talk_05b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}What do you want to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_05c

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That can't be all. Come on, show me
some more.

---
label: Com_Talk_05d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I'll buy anything as long as it isn't weird.
Too weird, anyway.

Yes.

No.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Hee-hee!{{delay8}} Well, thanks to you, I'll have to
restock now, won't I?

label: Com_Talk_90a_00

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Such generosity! I can see why the chief
considers you a friend!
