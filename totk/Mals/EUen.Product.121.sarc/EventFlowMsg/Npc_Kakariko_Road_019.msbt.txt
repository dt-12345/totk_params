I'm mighty hungry...

What's goin' on?

---
label: Near0006

Maybe I'll splurge today...

Well, I'll be...

These are something else.

I'd like to go shoppin'...

Oh, what to do...

I should buy a garland too.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey! Good day to see the sights
around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hey there! Hope you're not skipping
lunch.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there! Going without sleep to see
the sights, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there! Hope you didn't skip dinner.

label: Talk_Greeting0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Hey there... Seeing the sights isn't as
much fun in the rain, huh?

---
label: Talk0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there, kid! Did you come to see the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} too?

We might bump into each other when
you're running around the village, seeing
the sights.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you want to learn about the Ring Ruins,
be sure to ask the {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}}
people here. Or the {{color id="0"}}village chief{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You'll find her and a few team members
under one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}—the one
{{color id="0"}}floating{{color id="-1"}} on the north side of the village.

---
label: Talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Wow! {{delay8}}You sure helped me feel deep down
how ancient it is, kiddo. I got a mite too
excited for a man my age.{{pageBreak}}I'm going to keep wandering around here.
Hopefully we'll see each other again on
our tourist travels.

---
label: Talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Did you meet the {{color id="0"}}chief {{color id="-1"}}already? That girl
and the survey team might be youngsters,
but they're plenty knowledgeable.
Why, {{color id="0"}}they've taught me all sorts of things{{color id="-1"}}.
Won't be too long before I'm as wise as
they are!

---
label: Talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I'm just a simple tourist like you, kiddo!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team {{color id="-1"}}or village {{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}}
can tell you more about the Ring Ruins.

label: Talk0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}By the by, the {{color id="0"}}ingredients shop {{color id="-1"}}is running
low on goods.

Too many tourists to keep up with the
demand, I think.

---
label: Talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah, by the way, the old dear at the
ingredients shop was saying they're
{{color id="0"}}running low on eggs{{color id="-1"}}.
Too many tourists to keep up with the
demand, I think.

label: Talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Now that I've finished {{color id="0"}}touring the ruins{{color id="-1"}},
for today, I'm in the market for some
souvenirs.
The {{color id="0"}}ingredients shop{{color id="-1"}} looks like my best
bet. Only problem is, they've got so much
for sale—I don't know where to start.

---
label: Talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah! Before it slips my mind, you should
know the{{color id="0"}} inn{{color id="-1"}} isn't open for business.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The owner's gone off somewhere. Real
shame, leaving folks inn-less.

---
label: Talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Now that I've finished {{color id="0"}}touring the ruins{{color id="-1"}}
for today, I might get fancy and splurge
on a {{color id="0"}}soft bed{{color id="-1"}} at the inn tonight.

---
label: Talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Did those {{color id="0"}}ring garlands{{color id="-1"}} catch your fancy?


I've heard they're gettin' popular. I saw
one at a stable myself and thought it
looked real fine.
Rumor has it they bring {{color id="0"}}marriage{{color id="-1"}}. Maybe
I'll pick one up as a souvenir—never too
late, eh?

---
label: Talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}My, isn't it amazing how this ruin floats?


I might be done with my sightseeing
around the village, but this spectacle
sure is something else!

---
label: Talk0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}My, isn't it amazing how this {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}}
floats like that?

It was worth the trip just to see this.

label: Talk0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah, that reminds me. The prices at the 
{{color id="0"}}clothes shop{{color id="-1"}} are {{color id="0"}}through the roof{{color id="-1"}}—
now's not the best time for shoppin'.
I heard there's a reason though. I hope it
gets sorted soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Now that I've finished sightseeing for
today,{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}I'm in the market for some

And if I'm going shoppin', I'll need a new
outfit. Soon as I get my wallet in order,
it'll be new {{color id="0"}}clothes{{color id="-1"}} for me!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}But when's this rain going to leave off?
I've got some important sightseeing to do.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Now that I've finished sightseeing for

But with all these tourists running around,
the shops can't keep up. What a mess.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Now that I've finished sightseeing for

They've got a fine selection for such a

just lookin'!
