I want that pumpkin...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, hello. You're a traveler, aren't you?
But I guess we're all travelers, aren't we,
in one way or another! Haha!
You haven't by chance heard about a
{{color id="0"}}legendary pumpkin{{color id="-1"}}, have you?

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Stables are good places to learn things,
so I thought I'd hear about the {{color id="0"}}legendary
pumpkin {{color id="-1"}}here, but so far, no such luck.

Legendary pumpkin?

label: Talk_0021

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}So you don't know. {{delay8}}Of course! Why would
my luck be any different today?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Rumor has it that deep in a forest
somewhere, there's a legendary pumpkin
called the {{color id="0"}}Master Gourd{{color id="-1"}}.
I heard the flavor was powerful enough
to defeat any monster, no matter how
strong its stomach!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}But everyone I ask about it looks at me
like I'm talking nonsense. {{delay8}}Maybe I was fed
some bad info...

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Say, it's mealtime. This might be my chance to ask
other travelers about the Master Gourd.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}I'm happy to spend my whole entire day asking
strangers about the Master Gourd. I don't care who
snickers at me...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I need to learn what I can about the Master Gourd.
It's urgent, which means there's no time to sleep!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, we meet again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}With so many travelers passing through
the stables, I thought at least one would
know about the {{color id="0"}}legendary pumpkin{{color id="-1"}}.
But sadly, no such luck as yet.

label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What is it now?{{delay8}} Wait...{{delay8}} You know
something about the {{color id="0"}}legendary pumpkin{{color id="-1"}},
don't you?
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}If you know something, you have to
tell me! {{delay15}}Please?

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All I know is that it is—or was—hidden
deep in the woods somewhere...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}And that it can defeat any monster you
feed it to!

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}So you don't know what I'm talking about.
Pah! Figures!{{pageBreak}}I need to get to the bottom of this, one
way or another. Is it true that there's a
brave hero who wields the pumpkin?
That he harvested it from deep within a
forest somewhere?{{pageBreak}}Or that the flavor is powerful enough to
defeat any monster, no matter how strong
its stomach?
These are my unanswered questions
surrounding the legendary pumpkin
called the Master Gourd.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But everyone I ask about it looks at me
like I'm talking nonsense. Maybe I was fed
some bad info...

label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I can't stop wondering... What does the
{{color id="0"}}Master Gourd {{color id="-1"}}taste like?{{pageBreak}}I'm so preoccupied thinking about it, I can
hardly even hear the music.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Someone at this stable must have relevant
info. I'll have to keep asking around.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}A legendary sword, you say? And it's
called the {{color id="0"}}Master Sword{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wait, hey! So then the Master Gourd I'm
looking for...{{pageBreak}}Is it possible that I misheard? That they
were talking about the Master Sword?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}...Nah! {{delay8}}Why, just the other day I heard
a rumor about the Master Gourd being in
the {{color id="0"}}Lost Woods {{color id="-1"}}up north.
Guess you misheard, friend! That's so
embarrassing for you, hahaha!

label: Talk_0024

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Don't waste my time with that {{color id="0"}}Master
Sword {{color id="-1"}}silliness. A sword in the middle of
the woods? {{delay8}}Come on now!
I've finally pinpointed the Master Gourd's
location. It's in the Lost Woods.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}That means I'll have to travel to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}
of Hyrule, which is a ways off.{{pageBreak}}But I'll head there once I'm ready.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All right! When travelers come to hear the
musical troupe perform, I'll be able to ask
them about... {{delay15}}Hm?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}No musical troupe? But that means
no audience!{{pageBreak}}I was hoping for a nice, big group of
travelers that I could ask about the
