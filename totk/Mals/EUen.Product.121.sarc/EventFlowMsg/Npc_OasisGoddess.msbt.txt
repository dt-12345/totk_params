{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you ever heard of {{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}}?
{{delay8}}It's a lake on the summit of the mountain
west of here. {{color id="0"}}Tuft Mountain{{color id="-1"}}, it's called.
{{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}} was a fabled place when I
was young. It was said that you could find
your true love there...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I searched and searched and searched,
but I couldn't find it. Finally, I gave up.

Who would have thought I'd end up so
close to it all these years later?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't believe that {{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}} is up on
Tuft Mountain. If only I could let my
younger self know.
Why not go now? Well, young one,
let me tell you about bad backs and
what mountain climbing does to them...
No, I'll spare you. But believe me when I
say I'm happy just looking at the image
of {{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}} in the chief's house.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I never did get to fulfill my dream of
seeing {{color id="0"}}Lover's Pond{{color id="-1"}} in person, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It's enough that I got to see the image of
it that's hanging in the chief's house.

And every time I look at that image...I'm
reminded of my travels—leaving Gerudo
Town, seeing the beautiful blue ocean...
It was all worth it in the end.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This village... Monsters attacked it some
time ago and did some serious damage,
didn't they?
I'm impressed at how well it seems to
have recovered.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Heh, it's inspiring. Makes me feel like
I've still got a little fight left in me too.

Shoo, rain...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It rains a lot here, doesn't it?


We never got any rain back in Gerudo
Town, you know. It's a desert and all.

So when I first encountered rain,
I enjoyed it a lot. But now... Now it's
just a pain I could do without.

That's certainly a choice.
