Finally. A worthy rival.

Let's get a better look...

label: Talk_0001

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It's not often Tali considers someone a
worthy rival. You should feel honored.

The time limit for the expert course is
based on her fastest run, you know.

But seeing how you're so worthy and all,
I'm sure you'll have no trouble breaking
her record, right?

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The time limit for the expert course was
set by Tali on her fastest run.

You're gonna take a shot at breaking
her record, right? Seeing how you're
her rival and all.

label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It's not often Tali considers someone a
worthy rival. You should feel honored.

And what's more, you not only completed
the expert course, you beat her time too.
I admit I'm surprised.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I'm startin' to think there's nothing left
for us to do here.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}That run you took at the expert course...
I'm still impressed.

Maybe our work here is done.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}If you want to plan out a fast run, you
should think about getting yourself a
bird's-eye view of the race course.
Sure, you can run the course a bunch,
but that'll only get you so far. Use your
eyes. Study the course. Plan your moves.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Listen, running the course over and over
again can only get you so far.{{pageBreak}}Use your eyeballs. Size things up.
Plan your run ahead of time.

label: Talk_0019

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmph. Figures. {{delay8}}Looks like the weather
isn't gonna cooperate. What an annoying
place this is.

---
label: 0001
---
I want to talk to you...

---
label: 0002
---
Goodbye.

There's a water rally...

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Well, it's a real nice course. Give it a spin,
let's see how ya do!

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Fernison gave us a bunch of Zonai
thingamajigs as souvenirs.

She was real excited about it too.
Said she hoped it would help their
work get recognized and whatnot.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}She even taught us how to use this junk!
OK, I admit it, these things are gonna be
a real big part of our races from now on.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah, look at me runnin' at the mouth!{{delay8}}
Guess I'm just excited. Anyway, the Zonai
gizmos are here. Feel free to use 'em.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}But treat them right!{{delay8}} We're gonna use
'em, too, after all.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomSavsaaba_00"}}Sav'saaba.

---
label: Talk_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I didn't think those wheels would do much
good out on the ocean...

But Tali gets a kick out of attaching all
kinds of stuff to her vehicle before hitting
the water. Trial and error and whatnot.
My only real complaint about those Zonai
doohickeys is that they stop working if
you use 'em for too long.

---
label: Talk_1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Ugh, this rain! When will it ever let up?!

---
label: Talk_1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Feel free to use whatever you find
around here.

Can't wait to see what kind of contraption
you come up with!

---
label: 0015
---
I want to try it now!

---
label: Talk_1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What? {{delay8}}I thought you were gonna give the
course a good look-see. {{delay8}}Can't contain
your excitement, eh?

---
label: Talk_1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, first things first, you're gonna need
to build yourself a vehicle.

Once you've got something you consider
race-worthy, go ahead and attach that
steering stick you were given to it.

---
label: Talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Then, you'll have to get your jalopy on
the water.

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If I was younger, maybe I would do that
for you. But with age comes wisdom,
and my wisdom says, "Do it yourself."

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, and most importantly, the race is on
the surface of the water.

If that contraption of yours doesn't float,
the gate won't open, and the race
won't start.

---
label: Talk_1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Will you look at that! I've never seen a
steering stick so expertly attached.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That's what you wanted to hear, right?
Well, keep dreamin'!

Look, if you crash, it's gonna be a
hassle for all of us. So quit messing
around, and attach that stick right!

---
label: Talk_1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Will you look at that! What you're doing
with the steering stick there—SO clever!
I'm sooo impressed.{{delay30}}
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That's what you wanted to hear, right?
Well, keep dreamin'!

Look, if you crash, it's gonna be a hassle
for all of us. So quit messing around, and
attach that stick right!

---
label: Talk_1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I heard you haven't collected your
reward yet.

Well, go on! Clean out some of things so
you can pick it up from Bolson!

---
label: 0016
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk_1028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Bah.


If you want to look at another course, go
talk to Bolson.

---
label: Talk_1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Good. So which course is it gonna be?

---
label: Talk_1015
---
Not a bad choice.

---
label: Talk_1030
---
I like that look in your eyes. I see a lot
of determination.

---
label: Talk_1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Bolson, you're up! It's race time!

{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}{{size value="125"}}I'm on it!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey, hey! Don't go bothering Tali. She's
using her racing smarts to think up some
new vehicle designs.
If you're looking to take a run at a course,
you come talk to me instead.

---
label: Talk_1026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}While I appreciate the fact you came
running right over here to gib-gabble
with us...
Bolson there has been giving us the ol'
stink eye. Seems he wants your attention.

Go and say hello to him, will ya? Those
looks of his might set something on fire.

---
label: 0010
---
I'll try the course!

---
label: 0011
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you want to look the course over, talk
to Bolson, OK?

We're gonna watch your run and check
out your technique. You know, use that
to get a bead on things.
