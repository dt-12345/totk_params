One day, the winds that ought to blow
in Rito Village ceased. Then the heavens
grew stagnant, and the earth fell to ruin.
The villagers looked skyward for
a solution.

They saw a figure pierce through the
unmoving gray clouds and descend
swiftly toward them.

Believing no ordinary being could fall
from the heavens, the villagers called this
figure a god.
And the god stood atop a hill day after
day, longing to return home to their
island in the heavens.
The villagers, forgetting their own
troubles, tried to carry the god
home on their proud wings.
Yet who could say how far it might be,
the place this god came from?

The Rito took flight in turn, each hoping
to reach that place above the clouds...
Alas, none had wings strong enough.

Seeing this, the god told the leader of the
village that returning to the heavens was
possible if the Rito gathered materials.
Their spirits high, the villagers set about
doing so.

The god nodded upon seeing the tall pile
of materials. This, they understood, would
be enough.

The god poured a strange power into
the pile, and several small boats were
assembled.
Cautiously, the villagers boarded.
The small vessels began floating up
into the air.
With the god leading them, the boats
rose higher and higher, soon passing
through the thick clouds.
The vastness of the heavens took the
villagers' breath away. Floating islands
dotted a clear blue sky.
The villagers rejoiced songfully and then,
with reluctance, returned to earth.

One day, winds at the village roared back
to life. In shock, the villagers looked to
the sky.
Floating above them was an enormous
ship that the god had sent in gratitude.

Numerous oars on both sides began to
move like wings, soundlessly churning
the skies...

Air blew across Hebra once again.
The skies cleared, and blooming
flowers rose from the ground.
The god had given them the blessing
of wind.

This ark that saved the village from
catastrophe came to be known as the
Stormwind Ark.
So ends the story of the Stormwind Ark
that saved the village long ago.
