{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Haven't seen your mug before. You new
around here?{{pageBreak}}Listen, I got a proposition for ya. Involves
{{color id="0"}}taking care of some no-good pirates{{color id="-1"}}.
Whaddaya say—{{delay8}}feeling brave?

label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What is it, kid? {{delay15}}You thinkin' about {{color id="0"}}fighting
those pirates {{color id="-1"}}I mentioned?

---
label: 0001
---
Pirates?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}So what's the story, kid? You going to
{{color id="0"}}take care of those pirates {{color id="-1"}}or not?

---

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}HAAAhahaha! I'm only kidding!{{pageBreak}}A skinny little guy like you? You'd be a
goner before ya got out your sword!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}pirates {{color id="-1"}}I'm talking about, they're
nasty characters. Attacked {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Village{{color id="-1"}}
on the {{color id="0"}}coast south of here{{color id="-1"}}.
That place was my home, until the {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}
forced me out.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}A peaceful village, {{color id="0"}}blessed by the sea{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}
That's what it used to be.

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}HAAA! Hahaha! That will never not crack
me up!{{pageBreak}}Just the idea of it! A little pipsqueak like
you against the whole throng of 'em!
They'd eat you for lunch!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}If you know what's good for you, you'll
stay far away from those {{color id="0"}}pirates{{color id="-1"}}—and that
{{color id="0"}}big ship {{color id="-1"}}they've got.

---
label: Talk_0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}You chased 'em away? YOU?


Well, I'll be. You're stronger than you
look, ain't ya?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Last I saw, most of the buildings had
been destroyed...

But if the pirates are gone, maybe I'll
wait a while and then go poke around.
See the state of things.

---
label: Talk_0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Thanks, kid. That was the first good news
I've heard in ages.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Still, I doubt my shop's standing if those
pirates got to it...

---
label: Near_0002
---
Bah! Rain!

---
label: Near_0003
---
I don't want to get wet.

---
label: Talk_0221
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I grew up on the coast, so I enjoy a good
dip in the ocean. Soothes me.{{pageBreak}}But getting rain-wet? That I don't like
one bit. So outta my way! I need to get
somewhere dry.

---
label: Talk_0222
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I hate the way rain feels, but I don't mind
how it sounds. Reminds me of waves
crashin' on the beach.

---
label: Talk_0223
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oops. Excuse me.

---
label: Talk_0224
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hard to hear anything over the rain.

---
label: Near_0010
---
Wanna open one?

---
label: Near_0013
---
Come on! Try your luck!

---
label: Near_0011
---
Nasty weather...

---
label: Near_0012
---
Come back later, kid.

---
label: Talk_0114
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Well, look who it is. The kid who sent the
pirates packing.

The kid who rebuilt the whole village,
including this humble establishment.

When we met at the stable, I took you for
the fragile type.

Glad you proved me wrong.

---
label: Talk_0115
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}You're him, aren't ya? The kid who sent
the pirates packing?

The kid who rebuilt the village, including
this humble establishment?

I'd given up, ya know. I thought this town
was history.

Glad you proved me wrong.

---
label: Talk_0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But enough sappy stuff. This is the
Lucky Treasure Shop, where I run what
you'd call a game of luck.
See those treasure chests? Pick any one
of them and open it.{{pageBreak}}Don't be shy. Crack one open.

---
label: Talk_0107
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}C'mon, bud. It's not that complicated.
Pick a chest—any chest—and open it up.

---
label: Talk_0104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Here to try your luck again? Got bit by
the wagering bug?

---
label: Talk_0118
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Well, I won't stop you. Go ahead and
crack open a chest.

---
label: Talk_0101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}You're back already? Why the hurry?
Luck doesn't favor the hasty.{{pageBreak}}Then again, I'm a generous man. If you
want to play again that badly...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}...Eh.{{delay15}} Forget I said that. Come again
when some time has passed.

---
label: Talk_0102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You gotta wait, kid. Bugging me's not
going to change my answer.

Though I guess if you want to play that
badly... {{delay15}}No, never mind.

Just come back later.

---
label: Talk_0103

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}*sniff* {{delay8}}*sniff* *sniff*{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}I'd know that smell anywhere! That's the
smell I dream about, sure enough!{{pageBreak}}You've got a {{color id="0"}}roasted porgy {{color id="-1"}}in that pouch,
don't you? Give it!

---
label: Talk_0122
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I know that smell. You've got a {{color id="0"}}roasted
porgy{{color id="-1"}}! Gimmie!

---
label: 0004
---
Here you go.

---
label: Talk_0109
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Thanks, kid. I have a real weakness for
roasted porgy.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Tell you what. Seein' as you were so
generous, I'll bend the rules and let you
play again.

---
label: Talk_0123
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Mm, that'll do nicely. You can play again.

---
label: 0005
---
I don't have it!

---
label: Talk_0111
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Hm! {{delay8}}Hm! {{delay8}}Hmmm! {{delay8}}Fine.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}I'll take your word for it. I guess.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Ease"}}But I've closed up shop for the day,
so come back later.

---
label: Talk_0112
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry, but I'm out of prizes. I couldn't let
you play if I wanted to.{{pageBreak}}It'll take some time to restock, so come
back later, OK?

---
label: Talk_0119
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Mmm! I know that smell...{{delay15}} That's roasted porgy!{{pageBreak}}If I could, I'd trade him—the porgy for another crack
at the game. But I'm all outta prizes, so...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry, pal... You cleaned us out. I couldn't
let you play if I wanted to.{{pageBreak}}Give me some time to restock.

---
label: Talk_0200
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}C'mere, kid. Let's see it.

---
label: Talk_0201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Red?{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0207
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So that means...

---
label: Talk_0204
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You get the prize on the right! Lucky man!

---
label: Talk_0202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Blue, huh?{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0205
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Rats! You get the middle prize—that's the
big one. I hate to see it go.

---
label: Talk_0203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Green. OK.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk_0206
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That'll net you the prize on the left. Pff!
Take it, thief!

---
label: Talk_0210
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You must be pretty happy, scoring that
prize for free.{{pageBreak}}If you'd like it delivered to your place of
residence...{{delay8}}too bad, I don't do that.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Oop, also. I'll take that rupee back.

---
label: Talk_0211
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's not for you to keep.

---
label: Talk_0220
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}So that's the game. Pick a chest, and
win a prize. All upside.

There is one catch—{{delay8}}I have to cap how
much you play, or I'd go bankrupt.

Wouldn't want to shut me down right after
ya put me back in business, would you?

Didn't think so. Come back later if you
want another round.

---
label: Talk_0226
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Like what you got? Course you do.
With my prizes, there's no losing.{{pageBreak}}If you want to take another crack, you'll
have to come back later.

---
label: Talk_0225
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Well, kid? Satisfied?{{pageBreak}}I gotta hand it to you. You wanted all my
prizes, you got 'em.{{pageBreak}}Good on ya. Just give me time to restock
before you come back.

---
label: Talk_0106
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Where do you think you're going?


Village savior or not, you gotta follow the
rules like everyone else.

---
label: Talk_0116
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}You might've saved the village, but that
doesn't mean you can mess around with
my stuff!

---
label: Talk_0120
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hang on. You can't back out before the
game's over.

C'mon, show some enthusiasm. Crack
open one of my chests.
