Are you making sure to prepare against
the desert's cold nights?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Even the Gerudo, who call this desert
home, say the chill saps their energy.

I'm pretty lucky not to be affected by it,
but as for you...

If the cold is getting to you, you should
check out {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.

Look for the tall {{color id="0"}}watchtower{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}You can
use it to tell how far away you are from
the bazaar.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Although, since crossing the desert is a
real chore, it might be a good idea to rent
a {{color id="0"}}sand seal{{color id="-1"}} here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}The trek through Gerudo Canyon is rough,
but this view always makes it worthwhile.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}The view is beautiful, but it's a little
terrifying to be on a bridge so high up...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I was just watching the tumbleweeds...


Lately, I've realized how tumbleweeds
tend to just roll around like I do...

label: Talk_PointB_01

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I want to try traveling like a tumbleweed—
just let the wind take me wherever it feels
like blowing...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It sure is a long way... There used to be a
shorter route too.

But when the Upheaval happened, a flood
came and washed the road away.

If I were a Zora, I could swim it...

---
label: Talk_Between_A_Rest_01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}There used to be a shortcut around here,
but the water has made it impassable. If
only I could swim like a Zora...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh well. {{delay8}}I don't mind walking.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I sometimes see islands floating around
in the sky.

The little islands remind me of schools
of fish.

And there are big, round islands that look
like me!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You know, there could be plants and
animals we've never seen before living
on those islands.
I want to go there...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I love watching all the different islands
floating up there in the sky.

and animals live on them is really exciting!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The cliffs around here are so high...
I'll have to take the long way around.

I wish I had wings like the Rito do. It'd be
so easy to just fly over the cliffs, then.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Do you know about tumbleweeds?


They're the weeds rolling around in
Gerudo Canyon.

It's fun to watch them, but did you know
that you can break them open too?
Sometimes you'll find something inside!
Things must get tangled up in them while
they roll around...

label: Talk_Between_B_Rest_01_Back

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I love watching tumbleweeds roll around.
It's really entertaining.

Plus! If you break one open, sometimes
you might find that something good has
gotten caught up in it!
