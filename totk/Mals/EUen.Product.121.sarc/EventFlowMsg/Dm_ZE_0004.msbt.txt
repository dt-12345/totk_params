As I thought...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_001_b
---
This is not the world I know.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_002_b
---
A time so far back in the past, it's become legend...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_003_c
---
So it's true. This is really the era of
Hyrule's founding?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_005_ab
---
Your presence here is just as strange to us, Zelda.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_005_b
---
But if you, like Sonia, have a secret stone and are able
to manipulate time, then your story makes sense.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_005_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_006_b
---
Oh? I believed her right away. You needed the secret
stone as proof, Rauru?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_007_b
---
I can feel your light power within her. As well as my
time power.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_008_b
---
Additionally, I sense that we share a
blood connection.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_008_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_009_b
---
Ah. I see.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_010_b
---
In any case, Zelda...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_011_bb
---
You had said that you needed to return to
your era as soon as you possibly could...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_012_c
---
Yes.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_013_b
---
In my time, something terrible is happening...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bab
---
I need to get back there, but how do I do that?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bac
---
I don't even know how I got here in the first place.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bb
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_015_b
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_016_b
---
Now, Zelda, dear...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_016_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_017_b
---
You don't need to solve your problems all at once.
Why not come back with us to the castle?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_018_b
---
No...I...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_019_b
---
We'll tell everyone that you're...a distant relative
of ours.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_020_c
---
It is true, after all!

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_021_b
---
We'll get you fresh clothes too.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_021_c
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_022_b
---
I'm sure an answer will come to you. Wisdom
takes time.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_023_ab
---


---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_023_b
---
I don't know what to say...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_024_c
---
Hm, I wonder...

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_025_c
---
Mineru... She may have some idea of how
to get you back to your era.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_026_c
---
Mineru, you said?

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_027_c
---
Yes... She knows far more than anyone about
our people.

---
label: Dm_ZE_0004_Text_029_b
---
And like us, my older sister has a secret stone.
We'll call on her.
