The desert has been as calm as I've ever
seen it for quite some time now. No raids,
no monster attacks, no bandit incidents.
I should be happy about that, but it's my
job to keep an eye out and report any
events that are out of the ordinary.
And when nothing is happening, I have
nothing to do. But no matter how quiet
it gets, I can't leave my post.
I know how important this task is, but
that doesn't keep me from getting bored.
I should be grateful for the peace...

I've gotten word that this lookout post is
going to be shut down.

I was worried that it was because I hadn't
been doing my job, but it turns out that
wasn't the case at all.
It's actually because they are building a
lighthouse to help Kara Kara Bazaar and
Gerudo Town to communicate better.
The task of watching for anything unusual
will be moved there, so there's no reason
to maintain this lookout post.
I hear the lighthouse will be gigantic so
that it is visible in the worst sandstorms
the desert has to offer.
It's a bit exciting to imagine a beacon of
hope shining over Kara Kara Bazaar that
we could look to in a disastrous storm.
I can't wait to see the lighthouse
in person!

Today is my last day in the lookout post.
I'm a bit sad saying goodbye to this place.

But! I've been asked to supervise the
new training area being built at the
Southern Oasis.
I feel honored to be trusted with training
our soldiers. It's a direct way to help keep
the desert safe...
I've learned a lot from watching over the
desert here—it's time to put it to use by
teaching others what I know!
