It's only a matter of time...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Just how long are they going to stay there...


And this weather would make pretty good cover
for them to attack too. {{delay8}}Hm?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Just how long are they going to stay there...


And they may have spotted us spying on them from
the cliff... What should I do if they come all the way
up here? {{delay8}}Hm?{{size value="100"}}

label: Text1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've been preoccupied with the monsters
that have settled on {{color id="0"}}North Akkala Beach{{color id="-1"}}
below the cliff.
Thinking about what would happen if they
came up to the stable has me worried.

I can't even focus on my work...

---
label: Text1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've been trying to find someone to go
drive them off, but everyone I've asked
has refused to help.
It seems that kind of skill and confidence
is in short supply.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} do you see the big tree
over there?

---
label: Text1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you look down over the cliff from there,
you can probably see the monsters.

It's an intimidating sight, to be sure.

---
label: Text1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Everyone keeps saying not to worry, that
they won't come all the way to the stable.{{delay8}}
But I'm not so sure.
I don't think I'll really be able to relax
until those monsters are gone for good.

label: Text1012

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah, you're the traveler from earlier. Sorry,
I didn't notice you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm still preoccupied with the monsters
that have settled on {{color id="0"}}North Akkala Beach{{color id="-1"}}
below the cliff.
Thinking about what would happen if they
came up to the stable has me worried.

I can't even focus on my work...

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I've been trying to find someone to go
drive them off...

---
label: Text1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But everyone I've asked has lost their
nerve the moment they looked over the
edge and saw what they were up against.

---
label: Text1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you want to see what I'm talking about,
you can take a look over the edge by
that tree.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't imagine why monsters would be
settling on {{color id="0"}}North Akkala Beach{{color id="-1"}} of all
places, and I can't stop worrying about it.
I thought maybe I could build a barricade
on the road down from the stable...

Who am I kidding though? If a group that
big decided to head this way, there would
be no stopping them.

label: Near1003

Now I can relax.

---
label: Text1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We wouldn't stand a chance against
those monsters if they decided to attack
this stable.
Maybe I should look for a job somewhere
else? South Akkala Stable might have
some openings...

---
label: Text1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What?! You defeated every last one
of them?

H-hold on a second!{{delay8}} It's not that I don't
believe you, but I need to check for
myself. {{delay8}}It's the only way I'll sleep at night.

---
label: Text1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}You weren't kidding!


I can't believe it! There were so many
monsters before, but now they're gone!

---
label: Text1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Well, you're just amazing!


I'm sorry, I'm just so surprised.{{delay8}} I mean,
you don't look all that strong...

But you've been such a huge help! I can
already feel the stress those monsters
caused leaving my body. Thank you!
Hey, that reminds me. Do you have a
Pony Points card?

---
label: Text1037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Let me just add two points for you to
show my thanks!

---
label: Text1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}And I'd like to give you this too!

---
label: Text1034

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're supposedly a favorite of the horse
god, {{color id="0"}}Malanya{{color id="-1"}}. He lives a short distance
away from this stable, in fact.
I'd planned to ask him to help with the
monsters, and was going to give it to him
as a gift...
But now that the monsters have been
handled, I'll give it to you instead!

It's a really valuable carrot, and it doesn't
grow around here. Be careful not to
accidentally eat it!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Anyway, I should get back to work.
Thanks for all your help!

label: Text1035

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Are you not registered with the
Stable Association yet?

If you use stables, then you should
absolutely be registered. That's how
you get a Pony Points card!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Head on over to the counter to get set up,
then come back and talk to me.

---
label: Text1038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Are you all registered with the Stable
Association now?

---
label: Text1036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}In that case, I'll add two points for you
to show my thanks for your help with
those monsters.

---
label: Text1039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh... Hang on... You're already carrying
a ton of {{color id="0"}}endura carrots{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Well, I still want to give you this. Just let
me know when you've got some room
for it!

---
label: Text1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, are you back to collect your
{{color id="0"}}endura carrot {{color id="-1"}}from me?

Hmm. You still don't have any room.
Well, that's fine. Just come talk to me
when you've got some space!

---
label: Text1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, you've made some space? Then
here's the promised {{color id="0"}}endura carrot{{color id="-1"}}!
