That light...

---
label: near_0001
---
It lit up?!

---
label: near_0002
---
The light's incredible.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Gyah! You startled me...


Wait, what's someone else doing here?{{delay15}}
Oooh...{{delay8}} You must be reinforcements for
{{color id="0"}}investigating the tree{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah, you're {{color id="0"}}investigating the tree{{color id="-1"}} too?

---
label: 0000
---
Investigating the tree?

---
label: 0001
---
Just passing through.

---
label: talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What, {{delay8}}was I wrong?{{delay15}} I thought for sure
you were here to help investigate this
humongous tree...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I mean, just take a look. You see the
tree's...{{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}glowy core{{color id="-1"}}-looking thing?

---
label: talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Somehow that light is capable of {{color id="0"}}restoring
vitality lost to gloom{{color id="-1"}}...

Or so the rumor goes, anyway.{{delay8}} I'm here to
find out if that's true.

---
label: talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Ah, but you know, that's not my only
mission down here.

I've been asked to approach and eliminate
the Yiga Clan's greatest foe...{{delay8}} YOU!

---
label: talk_1030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Not interested in hearing me out? {{delay15}}There
are all sorts of interesting rumors about
this tree here...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, {{delay8}}it's not like they'll do you any good
after I've done you in.

---
label: talk_1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The heroic Link, {{delay8}}sworn enemy of the
Yiga Clan, tricked by my simple disguise!{{pageBreak}}It seems the stories are merely stories!

---
label: talk_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Look at this cleansing light...{{delay8}} The rumors
were true!{{delay8}} It really can {{color id="0"}}restore vitality lost
to gloom{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Ah, this light...{{delay8}} I've never felt anything
like it.{{delay8}}

It can {{color id="0"}}restore vitality lost to gloom {{color id="-1"}}in the
blink of an eye.

---
label: 0002
---
It can restore vitality?

---
label: 0003
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That's right!{{delay15}} The {{color id="0"}}bright core{{color id="-1"}} of this
gigantic tree{{delay8}} has the sacred power to {{color id="0"}}heal
vitality lost{{color id="-1"}} to gloom...{{delay8}}or so they say.
But when I got here, the light was weak.{{delay8}}
It wasn't able to heal anything at all, until
just now.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I was watching, you know.{{delay15}} It was you.


You lit up this tree, didn't you, Link?{{delay8}}
It feels like something the archenemy
of the Yiga Clan would do.
As does being fooled by my disguise!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What's wrong? Get hit with {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk_1046
---
{{anim type="LaughS"}}Then get into that light there.{{delay15}} It can {{color id="0"}}heal
any vitality lost{{color id="-1"}} to gloom, just like the
rumors say.

---
label: talk_1051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Come on, hurry it up.

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you got {{color id="0"}}gloomed{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} go step into that light.

---
label: talk_1052
---
{{anim type="LaughS"}}It'll {{color id="0"}}restore whatever vitality{{color id="-1"}} the gloom
took out of you, just like the rumors said!

---
label: talk_1053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Make it snappy. If you-know-who sees
you, he's gonna suspect something's up!

---
label: talk_1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}What's up? Did the {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} get you
or something?

---
label: talk_1047
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That's rough. Hate to tell you, we still
haven't figured out the deal with that
{{color id="0"}}bright core{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}You best head to the surface.

---
label: talk_1048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Is there really a way to amplify that light?

---
label: talk_1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you've been {{color id="0"}}gloomed{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} you better head
straight back up to the surface.

---
label: talk_1049
---
{{anim type="Sad"}}We still don't know what's going on with
that {{color id="0"}}bright core{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_1050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Is there really no way we can make that
light shine brighter?
