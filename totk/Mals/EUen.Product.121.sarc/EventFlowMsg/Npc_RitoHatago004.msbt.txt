{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}No kindling shortcuts. My {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I should go collect more {{color id="0"}}wood {{color id="-1"}}soon.


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I tried using a {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine cone{{color id="-1"}} to fuel a
fire a while back, and I got more than I
bargained for.

Lucky Clover Gazette?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This place was once a stable. And I was
once its owner.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But when that terrible cold wave rolled in,
it froze up our business along with the
rest of Hebra.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Which is why the stable is closed and the
{{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette {{color id="-1"}}has bought out the
old space.
I don't have anywhere else to go, so I
thought I'd try to help out around here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Not that I'm much good at it. I just
learned the terrifying way what happens
when you burn a {{color id="0"}}Hylian pine cone{{color id="-1"}}...

I thought I'd try to help out around here
for a while. It's not like I have anywhere
else to go.
But it's a lot of work I'm not used to, and
I'm still sort of fumbling through learning
it all.

Hylian pine cones?

label: Talk_0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Perhaps due to the abnormal weather,
there's been an explosive increase in
Hylian pine cones.
They're very oily on the inside and burn
really well.

Too well, in fact. I tried tossing one onto
the fire for kindling, and it went up so
violently, it created a {{color id="0"}}whirlwind{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Which in turn sent all of the freshly
printed newspapers flying far, far away...

I'm supposed to be helping the {{color id="0"}}Lucky
Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}}, and that was very much
the opposite of help.

An explosive increase in {{color id="0"}}Hylian

Those pine cones are very oily on the
inside and burn something fierce.

I learned that the hard way by tossing
one onto the fire. It burst into flame so
ferociously, it whipped up a {{color id="0"}}whirlwind{{color id="-1"}}!
