{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I hate to break it to you, but the Skyview
Tower is out of order.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'm here to fix it, but unfortunately, the
elevator is broken too!{{delay8}} I can't get up to
the tower to make the repairs.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Do you see the metal bit up there?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There used to be a platform attached to
that. If you added enough weight, it'd go
down...{{delay8}}and I'd go up.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But the platform is gone. There's nothing
attached to that metal bit, so I'm stuck
down here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I obviously can't fix the Skyview Tower.
Wish I knew of some way to get to
the top...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}There used to be a platform attached to
the metal bit up there.{{delay8}} You could {{color id="0"}}put
weight on it to make this platform move{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But the other platform is gone. {{delay15}}I'm
thinking of just giving up for now and
coming back another time.

working?{{delay8}} You're amazing!

right away.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Are you the one who got the elevator
working?{{delay8}} I came to fix the terminal in the
Skyview Tower here but got stuck below.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Anyway, I'll get to repairing the tower
right away!

{{anim type="Think_00"}}Uh-oh.{{delay15}} The drive-assembly mechanism is
stuck, probably from all the hot, hot hours
of the day here.
But if I swap out those parts for
heat-resistant ones...{{delay15}} Yes!{{delay8}} It worked!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Thanks to you, I could fix the Skyview
Tower!{{delay15}} Please, take this for your trouble.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you're heading to the desert, {{delay15}}make sure
to protect yourself from the heat. It can
get dangerous out there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Sometimes there's just no avoiding the
heat.{{delay8}} When that happens, a meal that'll
cool you down should come in handy.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Aaah! Dangerous!
