You may see a Rito visitor here named

stock up on food.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}The{{color id="0"}} massive cold snap {{color id="-1"}}is over, and things
have finally settled down around here.{{pageBreak}}But there's no shortage of strange
happenings these days. Please take
care during your travels.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Our employee {{color id="0"}}Banji {{color id="-1"}}really knows this area,
so don't be shy about asking for her help.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Oh! You've noticed our new decoration!{{pageBreak}}Someone from the Stable Association
brought it in the other day. These ring
garlands are very "in" right now.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They come straight from {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in Necluda, east of Central Hyrule.
They're a local specialty, or so I'm told.

---
label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Hahaha! I see our ring garland has really
caught your fancy.{{pageBreak}}I can't give it to you, but if you'd like to
buy your own, I recommend you pay a
visit to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's quite a ways to travel, but it's located
in {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}} to the southeast of here.

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Please be careful with our garland. If you
want your own, you can buy one in
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
The village is in {{color id="0"}}Necluda{{color id="-1"}}, far southeast of
us.{{delay8}} Given your clear enthusiasm, though,
it might be worth the trip.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you cross the Tabantha Great Bridge
around the corner from our stable, you'll
see ruins on the mountain.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I thought that accenting this place with a
picture of the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns{{color id="-1"}} greeting
the {{color id="0"}}sunrise{{color id="-1"}} might please our customers.
Though when I went out before dawn to
PAINT said picture...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}I found myself staring down an
enormous monster!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I ducked away and hurried home safely,
{{delay8}}but it's sadly impossible to paint at the
actual location as things are now...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}I can't paint that view from memory, {{delay8}}but if
I even had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture of it{{color id="-1"}}, I'm
sure I could re-create it for our stable.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}What's that?{{delay8}} Do you have a picture of
the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns in the sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns{{color id="-1"}} are on the mountain
across the Tabantha Great Bridge
out front.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}And I imagine a painting of those columns
basking in a majestic {{color id="0"}}sunrise{{color id="-1"}} would
make our customers very happy.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}But I've given up on painting it myself now
that I've seen how terrifying the monsters
on that mountain can be.

---
label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}This wall is where I would display my
painting of the {{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns bathed in
the light of the sunrise{{color id="-1"}}...if only I had one!
Imagine how pleased our customers would
be to gaze at a sight like that!

I've got a picture.

Goodbye.

I've got nothing.

label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Did you bring me {{color id="0"}}a picture of the
Ancient Columns in the sunrise{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}So long as you have a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} I can paint
a copy of it in two shakes of a horse's tail.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If {{delay8}}you happen to have {{color id="0"}}a picture of the
Ancient Columns at sunrise{{color id="-1"}}, please
show it to me!

label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}It's miraculous that such an old ruin has
remained so well-preserved.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If you have a picture—any picture—of the
{{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns at sunrise{{color id="-1"}}, I'll paint a
copy and display it.
So if you ever want to update the decor
around here, simply show me a picture,{{delay8}}
and it will be done.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}When I look at this picture, I think about
gathering up my family one day to take a
look at the real thing.
{{anim type="Sigh_01"}}There's no way we could close the stable
to do so, of course, but...{{delay8}}that only makes
me more grateful for your kindness.

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thanks to you, Link, I could finally display
the painting I had given up on.{{pageBreak}}The sight of our region's {{color id="0"}}Ancient Columns
lit by the sunrise{{color id="-1"}} will very likely—{{delay8}}no, will
SURELY—delight our customers!

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh,{{delay8}} did you have something to say about
the {{color id="0"}}picture of the Ancient Columns{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}It really is an evocative painting. I feel as
though the past comes to life every time
I look at it.

Let's change it up.
