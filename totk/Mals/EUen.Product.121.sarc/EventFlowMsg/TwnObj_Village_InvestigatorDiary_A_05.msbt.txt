The Stone Slab at the Large Ring Ruin:
Some Translation Notes
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 　　　-Tauro{{pageBreak}}"The Demon King...vast power...
No hope...victory... King's own life...
managed...imprison him...{{pageBreak}}"Imprison...not...indefinitely... Prepare...
Demon...revival... We sages must...leave
our knowledge...future generations..."{{pageBreak}}Reading between the lines, this stone slab
seems to be a record of how the king in
those days challenged the Demon King.{{pageBreak}}If I had to extrapolate the meaning, I'd
guess at something like this...{{pageBreak}}"The reigning king determined that they
were no match for the Demon King and
gave his own life to imprison the threat.{{pageBreak}}"The sages tried to leave something for
the people of the future who would have
to prepare for the Demon King's revival."
