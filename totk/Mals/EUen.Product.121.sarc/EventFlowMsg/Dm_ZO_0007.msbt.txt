{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Link! It has been far too long!{{delay15}} I received
word that you had gone missing and was
beside myself with concern.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Whatever could have transpired?!

---
label: Dm_ZO_0007_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}To think something like that could have
taken place beneath Hyrule Castle!

And afterward, you mysteriously awoke on
a sky island...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}The sky...{{delay15}} Could it be that the sky is the
key to everything after all?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, my apologies. {{delay15}}I have actually been
wondering if those floating sky islands
could be the source of the falling sludge.
That is why I have tasked a Zora historian
with investigating ruin fragments and all
historical documents related to the sky.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="ShidoClench_00"}}As for me, I am not at liberty to leave this
spot at present, as I am uniquely qualified
to deal with the sludge here.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You see, old friend...{{delay15}} This place is the
source of the water that flows into
Zora's Domain.
That is why I must use my power of water
manipulation {{delay15}}to separate the sludge from
our water in order to clean it.
If I cease, then the sullied water will flow
into our beloved home, and there will be
much pain and suffering.
That is why I cannot afford to leave here,
no matter what.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Say, Link...


Does it not seem that Princess Zelda's
whereabouts might be related to the
floating sky islands and the ruins?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}If so, perhaps you should go and speak
with our historian Jiahto. {{delay8}}His many years
have blessed him with great wisdom.
It is quite possible that he could provide
you with some useful information.

At present, you should be able to find
Jiahto continuing his investigation at
{{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}By the way... I hope you know that I am
truly happy to see you again after such a
long time apart, my dearest friend.
Visit me anytime you like! Your presence
is never anything less than welcome
and appreciated.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm... {{delay15}}It seems tragedy has fallen upon
the whole of the kingdom, then.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, Link! Before I forget...{{delay15}} Have you,
by chance, paid a visit to Zora's Domain?

{{anim type="Embarrassed_01"}}I ask because...you see... {{delay15}}I have entrusted
the domain to a Zora of incredible
character. Her name is Lady Yona.
Considering this mess with the sludge, it
is a thorny task, to be sure.{{delay8}} I cannot help
but worry for her safety.
If it is not asking too much, would you
please go and see how she is faring in
these trying times?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Ah! Link!{{delay15}} Have you had a chance to visit
Zora's Domain yet?

---
label: Dm_ZO_0007_22

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I see. {{delay15}}So that filthy sludge is still plaguing
the domain...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That aside, I am so grateful to hear that
Lady Yona and the others are safe for
the time being.
Thank you for putting my heart at ease,
Link. You are truly an exceptional friend.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Now then. {{delay15}}With that concern quelled for
the moment, on to the bigger issue. {{delay15}}My
mind has been racing since we last spoke.
Link, you said that you mysteriously
awoke on a sky island, correct?
