Which means you have to eat it here.{{delay8}}
Is that OK?

label: 0004
---
Never mind.

---
label: 0003
---
Sure, that's fine!

label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right! That'll be {{color id="0"}}10 rupees{{color id="-1"}}, please!

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Oh, this is awkward. You don't have
enough rupees.

How about you fatten up your wallet a bit,
and then come back?

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Thanks, bud!


There's a procedure you have to follow
when you eat this, so listen closely.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}First, close your eyes... {{delay8}}Imagine the god
of horses standing in front of you...

{{size value="125"}}Then open wide and stuff it in!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}With the bun in your mouth, turn toward
the god of horses. Facing him, ponder his
awesome power...
And chew like you've never chewed
before! But keep that mouth closed!

Then swallow before it dissolves!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So! What do you think?


Tasty, right? And not just that, but you
feel changed somehow, huh?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I can tell you look a little different now!

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh... Actually, you don't seem much
different than before.

Guess you ate it wrong. Tough luck!

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've got plenty more Malanya Buns, so if
you want another, just ask!

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wish I could give Malanya one of these
buns. Maybe then he'd have the energy to
leave his bud.

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Now that Malanya's feeling better, I might
go and offer him a few buns!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration"}}Welcome, {{delay8}}good sir.
