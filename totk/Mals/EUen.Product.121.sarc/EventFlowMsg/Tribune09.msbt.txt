One more time, please?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Your story is...{{delay8}}really something. Mind
going through it again, just to make sure
I have all the details right?{{delay8}}

---
label: Ready_Talk_015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Sure, no problem...{{delay15}} We've been taking
care of a very rare animal for {{color id="0"}}Princess
Zelda{{color id="-1"}}—a {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But the poor thing ran away from
our stable.

---
label: Ready_Talk_016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmm...{{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}'s horse vanishing
like that is a pretty big story. But tell me
again—why'd that horse run off?

---
label: Ready_Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That's the troubling part,{{delay8}} isn't it...{{pageBreak}}When it happened, I'd finished tending to
the horses and was taking a bit of rest in
the stable.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Then that gentle creature began making
terrible sounds—neighing and bucking
around so hard, it shook the stable.

---
label: Ready_Talk_002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}So you went outside to see what was
wrong, didn't you?

---
label: Ready_Talk_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Yes, exactly...{{delay8}} And there she was!
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}! After all this time, she
was right in front of our stable.
But then the princess came closer, and
the {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}} thrashed harder.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Then that animal broke free and bolted
away like nothing I've ever seen before.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I couldn't help staring at that crazed
creature, and when I looked back at the
princess, she was just...{{delay8}}gone.
It happened so fast.

---
label: Ready_Talk_004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}So, you lost sight of the horse, and then
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} vanished on the spot.
That's all strange, from start to finish...
My little sources tipped me off about this,
but I have to say, I thought it was going
to turn out to be nothing much.

---
label: Ready_Talk_005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hey, partner! You're here! I should've
known it was you there.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Just look at you, tiptoeing up like this
and getting your ear in. You've got the
makings of a real reporter.

---
label: Ready_Talk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Oh! Is this someone else from
the newspaper?

---
label: Ready_Talk_007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's right—new partner, plenty of gusto,
a lot of promise.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Would it be all right if he listens in? Now,
please, tell us anything else you can
remember. Anything at all...

---
label: Ready_Talk_008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The part that really bothers me...{{delay8}}is the
poor animal acting that way.

That horse truly loved the princess. She
rescued it and protected it. She doted
on it!
But the horse was terrified, and for the
life of me, I can't understand why.{{delay8}}

---
label: Ready_Talk_009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}is known far and wide
for her compassion. I can't imagine our
princess being terrifying at all.

---
label: Ready_Talk_010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hold on...{{delay8}}I think I did catch the briefest
glimpse of the princess's face.

I thought I couldn't have seen that right,
but she had such a cold expression.

She's been full of warmth when she's
been here before. Maybe the princess was
furious that I let the horse get away.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I...{{delay8}}I really should find that animal and
bring it back here for her.

---
label: Ready_Talk_017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But that poor horse {{color id="0"}}galloped north{{color id="-1"}} and
never looked back.

---
label: Ready_Talk_013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I'd go in search of that steed, but with
the {{color id="0"}}huge monster {{color id="-1"}}that's flying around up
north, it's far too dangerous for me.
The best I can do is just keep the horse's
home here in the stable nice and clean,
just in case it returns...{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}I just hope someone finds that
sweet creature and brings it back
here safely.

---
label: Near03
---
A curious case for sure...

---
label: Near04
---
I hope that horse is safe.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_000_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}*sigh* How could that have happened...{{delay15}}
It's so troubling.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_001_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}So...{{delay15}}seems like we've got a real hill to
climb here before we have our story.
What's our next step?{{delay8}}

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Let's review the facts... The horse at the
heart of all this should be fond of {{color id="0"}}Princess
Zelda{{color id="-1"}}, right?
Yet, the animal bolted as if scared of her?
Very strange.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_011_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That horse trusted {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}like no
one else. Why did it run away as if it was
scared of her?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I just can't wrap my head around this...

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I wonder what's happened to that poor
horse. {{delay8}}That gentle creature is not the
type to just bolt.
The horse was fond of {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}},
too, but ran away from her, and right
toward some huge monster?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}None of this makes sense.

---
label: 0001
---
WAS it the princess?

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Well, if I had to be certain...{{delay8}}honestly, I'm
not totally sure. The snow was coming
down hard when it happened.
But even so, I'd swear it was her face.
I'd know {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}anywhere, even
in a blizzard.

---
label: 0002
---
Describe the horse.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It has a beautiful {{color id="0"}}golden coat{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}


Then there's its {{color id="0"}}mane of honeycomb plaits{{color id="-1"}}
the princess braided herself.{{delay15}} There's no
other horse out there that looks like it.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That horse bolted off fast, but I do know it
{{color id="0"}}galloped north {{color id="-1"}}of here.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'd go off in search of that horse this
very moment, if it weren't for the huge
monster flying around.
I'm terribly worried. {{delay8}}I hope that poor
creature is OK.

---
label: 0006
---
Huge monster?

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_01"}}You haven't heard? {{delay8}}There's a huge
monster with three heads that's been
seen flying around up north.
They say it breathes out dangerous
plumes of frost. I doubt I'd come out
alive if I met a terror like that.
Maybe you could survive by {{color id="0"}}hiding from
view {{color id="-1"}}as soon as you got close to it.

---
label: 0003
---
Goodbye.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I really should go out and search for
the poor horse.{{delay15}} But what if I run into
that monster?
Besides, for all I know, that steed will get
agitated and start {{color id="0"}}acting wild {{color id="-1"}}as soon as
it sees me.
I don't have the stamina to calm down
such a strong horse. Then again, I could
always use {{color id="0"}}energizing elixir{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_015_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey, now there's an idea!{{delay8}} I could share
some of that with you!

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_015_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You might know this, but to catch a wild
horse, you have to mount it, and then
soothe it before you get bucked off.
But some horses will kick and stir and
make such a fuss, they wear you down
before you can catch them.
This is where {{color id="0"}}energizing elixir {{color id="-1"}}comes in.{{delay15}}
If you're trying to soothe a horse and your
stamina's nearly out, drink some.
Then you'll have the energy to soothe
any mount—even the wildest of the wild.

Oh, and if you want to know how to make
that, just stew up a {{color id="0"}}restless cricket {{color id="-1"}}with
monster parts.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I'm told you can get similar effects from
cooked {{color id="0"}}stamella shrooms {{color id="-1"}}too.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_015_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Oh... {{delay8}}Full pouch, I see.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}In that case, here. Use that to buy the
ingredients and make some yourself.

---
label: Ready_Talk_101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Oh! {{delay8}}Look who's finally back home!{{delay15}}


No doubt about it! {{delay15}}That is {{color id="0"}}Princess
Zelda{{color id="-1"}}'s steed for certain!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I've been worried sick, {{delay8}}but now you've
found it!

---
label: Ready_Talk_102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Huh, when did you...{{delay8}} Oh, never mind.


{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}So, partner,{{delay8}} when you show up and save
the day in the middle of my reporting
work here...
Well, it kind of throws me off my saddle,
you know what I'm saying?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Oh, just giving you a hard time!{{delay15}} Besides,
those good deeds of yours just feather
my reputation. {{delay8}}You make me proud!{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But, huh... Is it just me, or has that
misplaced pony there gotten kind of
attached to you?

---
label: Ready_Talk_103_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I know this horse well, and I do believe
you're right!{{delay8}}

---
label: Ready_Talk_103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Really... {{delay8}}You'd be doing me a favor if you
kept this gentle creature.

Princess Zelda asked me to find someone
who'd take good care of it.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}And in your travels around Hyrule,
perhaps you'll even have a chance to
reunite this horse with the princess.

---
label: Ready_Talk_104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If that's the case, partner, then how
could you say no to keeping it? Do it
as a favor for the horse, at least.

---
label: Ready_Talk_107
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Wait, I want you to have this too.

---
label: Ready_Talk_106
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Also...{{delay8}}please take this!

---
label: Ready_Talk_105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}These are a {{color id="0"}}bridle {{color id="-1"}}and a {{color id="0"}}saddle {{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}}left
behind by Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The little one's accustomed to those,{{delay8}} so
feel free to use them.

---
label: Ready_Talk_108
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Also, take this with you!

---
label: Ready_Talk_109
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'd thought of using this energizing elixir
if I had to help calm the horse after it
bolted off...
But I don't need that anymore, so I'll
give it to you.

---
label: Ready_Talk_110
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I'd planned on using those rupees for
energizing-elixir ingredients, in case I had
to try to calm the horse in its state.
But I don't need that elixir now, so just
take the rupees as a reward.

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You might still be a rookie, but you're
every bit as good of a reporter as I
thought you'd be.
Thanks to you, I'll have the full story
when I write my article!

---
label: HorseTake_Talk_202
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}All right. I'm off to the office to write up
this whole piece for the paper.{{delay8}}

Take care, partner. Let's work together
again soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Goodbye_00"}}{{size value="125"}}Soar long!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Ready_Talk_301
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Well, actually...{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Our beloved, missing {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}
showed up at the stable here the
other day!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It was strange...{{delay8}} The sight of her really
agitated the princess's {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}},
which we keep stabled here.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The steed started acting wild, like it was
terrified for its life. That poor creature
bolted, and I haven't seen it since.

---
label: Ready_Talk_302
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Wait! Your horse has a{{color id="0"}} golden coat{{color id="-1"}}, just
like hers!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}It can't be! {{delay8}}It must be! {{delay15}}That's the
princess's {{color id="0"}}golden horse{{color id="-1"}}, which has
been missing for quite some time.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I've been worried sick, {{delay8}}and now here
you've brought the horse back.

---
label: Ready_Talk_303
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Whoa, partner! I've barely got my beak
into the situation here, and you just roll
in with the horse?
That kind of throws me off the saddle
here in the middle of an interview,
you know what I'm saying?
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Oh, just giving you a hard time! Besides,
these good deeds of yours just feather
my reputation. You make me proud!{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}But, huh... Is it just me, or has that horse
gotten kind of attached to you?

---
label: Ready_Talk_304
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}What's strange is that when {{color id="0"}}Princess
Zelda {{color id="-1"}}appeared here, {{delay8}}this gentle creature
ran off in a frenzy, as if terrified.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But for some reason, the princess's horse
really does seem to trust you.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Now that I think about it, I can't believe
that horse ran away at the sight of
{{color id="0"}}Princess{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.
Could it be that wasn't the princess?
I'd know her face anywhere, but it was
snowing hard. Maybe...{{delay8}}I have it wrong.
