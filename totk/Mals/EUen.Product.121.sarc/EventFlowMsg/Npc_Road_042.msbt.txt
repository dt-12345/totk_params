{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey. You got any ore on ya? I'll tell ya
somethin' useful.

Anytime you've got extra ore janglin'
around, you might wanna visit a shop.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}In particular, shops pay a high price for
precious {{color id="0"}}gems{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Precious {{color id="0"}}gems {{color id="-1"}}sell for a high price.{{delay8}} If ya
end up with extra, take it to a shop and
sell it off!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The best rock roast around is served up
at a {{color id="0"}}restaurant {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Eldin {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}northeast{{color id="-1"}}.

My brother, Boldon, is a regular {{color id="0"}}there{{color id="-1"}},
so if you head there yourself, you might
run into him.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you do see him, tell him hi from me,
will ya?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The rain will make poets of us all...{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Humming"}}Pitter-patter, plop-plop, drippy-drippy
drip-drop.{{delay8}} Sopping wet and juicy sweet
and—{{delay8}} ARGH! There I go AGAIN.
I can't stop thinking about the juicy
deliciousness of {{color id="0"}}opals{{color id="-1"}}! 

Splooshy, splashy, yum-yum.{{delay8}} GAH, I want
to EAT one!{{delay15}} No use!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Who am I kiddin'? I'm no poet. I'm just a

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Hey...does it feel like the amount of {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}}
has dwindled a lot lately?{{delay15}} I wonder if it's
to do with the Upheaval...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Eh, but I've heard otherwise.{{pageBreak}}I'VE heard that inside those recent {{color id="0"}}cave
formations{{color id="-1"}}, there's all sorts of new
{{color id="0"}}ore deposits{{color id="-1"}}.
{{anim type="Think"}}You can make easy money selling rare
{{color id="0"}}gems {{color id="-1"}}off to shops,{{delay8}} so it's common sense
to investigate a {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}when you find one.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Word on the street is those recent {{color id="0"}}cave
formations {{color id="-1"}}have all sorts of fresh {{color id="0"}}ore

it a good look-see. Never know what ya
might find.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey...don't it feel like it's been one weird
thing after another since {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}The other day, my precious {{color id="0"}}hammer {{color id="-1"}}that
I've loved and cared for since...well, since
forever...just up and rotted!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It was beyond fixing, so I slapped a rock
onto a {{color id="0"}}wooden stick{{color id="-1"}} and had me a
new {{color id="0"}}hammer{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It might not be pretty,{{delay8}} but it beats a
rotten ol' {{color id="0"}}hammer{{color id="-1"}} any day of the week.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}{{color id="0"}}Gems {{color id="-1"}}aren't just pretty little rocks,
ya know.

Take 'em to a shop to make easy money.
If you gather lots, you'll get rich quick.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Of course, that's not the only thing you
can do with gems.{{delay8}} Take, for example...

The {{color id="0"}}sapphire{{color id="-1"}}! It's cool and pleasant on
the tongue.{{delay15}} Or try a {{color id="0"}}ruby{{color id="-1"}},{{delay15}} which offers a
tender and delicate warmth.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Mmm...{{delay8}} I'm drooling again.

label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="0"}}Gems {{color id="-1"}}are worth more than money. They
can be used in other ways too. Like eatin'.

The cool {{color id="0"}}sapphire{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} The spicy {{color id="0"}}ruby{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}
Mmm. {{delay8}}Just thinking about them and I'm
droolin' all over myself again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="0"}}Eldin{{color id="-1"}} up to the northeast has really cooled
off. The climate there should be much
more doable for a Hylian such as yourself.
I know, because I'm from {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}},
which is out there!{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The economy there has been doing better
lately, too, with {{color id="0"}}gems cheaper than ever{{color id="-1"}}.
It's a great time to visit.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm from {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}, which is in the {{color id="0"}}Eldin

and the {{color id="0"}}gems there are so cheap{{color id="-1"}} now.
You should check it out!
