{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}She said it was a simple mask, but it
looked funny to me. And she had me
make it with an odd material...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}At the time, my apprentice, Fugo, kept
sayin' he wanted to be a smithy like me.

But now, all he talks about is {{color id="0"}}marbled

his face round here anymore.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Dagnabbit. And it was finally time for me

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Confound that Hylian blondie! Forcing me

Here I thought I'd be teachin' my

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You'll need a cobble crusher, five

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}Since you spent all our material funds
