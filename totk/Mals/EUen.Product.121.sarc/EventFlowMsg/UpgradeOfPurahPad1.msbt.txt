{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, you! We have more work to do!
Your {{color id="0"}}Purah Pad{{color id="-1"}} is nowhere near its full
capability yet.

---
label: Talk_65

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The Purah Pad will be even better after
I add some extra features.{{pageBreak}}Those include the most essential one,
the {{color id="0"}}travel medallion {{color id="-1"}}feature that lets you
set up gates for instant travel anywhere.
There's also {{color id="0"}}hero's path mode{{color id="-1"}}. It shows
where you've traveled. Finally, {{color id="0"}}sensor +{{color id="-1"}},
which helps you find more than shrines.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}Your Purah Pad will be perfect once

label: Talk_06

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But first I'll need you to gather some test

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}So! Let's get to work on that pad!


Just talk to me anytime you'd like to get

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Want to hear anything else about my

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}The {{color id="0"}}travel medallion{{color id="-1"}} feature is quite
exceptional. It lets you {{color id="0"}}travel instantly{{color id="-1"}} to
a gate you've established elsewhere.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But we're going to have a little bit of
an extra challenge with all this...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Come now, give me your Purah Pad for

---
label: Talk_22

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Look here. In distant Akkala, up in its
northeastern corner...

is the {{color id="0"}}Akkala Ancient Tech Lab{{color id="-1"}}, which
is also my home.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}That's where my {{color id="0"}}prototype of the
travel medallion {{color id="-1"}}feature is. I started
work on it back there.

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I'd go get it myself, but word is that
some {{color id="0"}}dangerous trespassers {{color id="-1"}}have made
themselves at home there.
That's why I'd like to have you, with all
your great talents, go there and fetch
my {{color id="0"}}travel medallion prototype{{color id="-1"}}!
To speed this journey along...{{delay15}}well, the

---
label: Talk_26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I've activated a {{color id="0"}}travel gate{{color id="-1"}} outside this
lab. Now you can get here instantly,
if not faster!
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}You'll need to make your own way to the
Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, however.

You'll find the {{color id="0"}}travel medallion prototype{{color id="-1"}}
in a chest beside my desk there. Should
be easy enough to find.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}You're curious about my travel medallion

I'm only the greatest inventor ever!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}travel medallion{{color id="-1"}} feature is a
wonderful addition that lets you {{color id="0"}}travel
instantly{{color id="-1"}} to any spot you choose.
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}But I left my {{color id="0"}}travel medallion prototype{{color id="-1"}}
back at the {{color id="0"}}Akkala Ancient Tech Lab{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's why I need you to go there and
fetch it for me!{{pageBreak}}Word is that some {{color id="0"}}dangerous trespassers{{color id="-1"}}

So...{{delay8}}you're the only one who can get it
for me. I've put the location on the
{{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}} in your Purah Pad.
It's quite a long way, but if you keep
checking that map, you'll be able to
make your way right there.

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Of course you want the {{color id="0"}}travel medallion{{color id="-1"}}
feature. Who wouldn't want to travel
instantly to wherever you want!
I will need my {{color id="0"}}travel medallion prototype{{color id="-1"}},
which is at the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab.
Sorry, but—{{delay15}} Hmm?{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Wait! Do I detect the unmistakable odor
of my old home on you?

---

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Good job.{{delay8}} That will do the trick!

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ta-da-da-da-daaah!{{size value="100"}}{{delay30}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I added that to your {{color id="0"}}Key Items{{color id="-1"}}, so you'll
never lose the ability to use it.

If you want to be able to travel instantly
to your favorite spot, just stand there and
set up a travel gate by using that.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Then at any time, you can just zip right
there by selecting that very spot on
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}. Easy, right?{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well...{{delay8}}I've told you what you need to

gone in one ear and out the other.
So, hang on a minute.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, yes! I should prepare operation

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wonder what I could do if I had even
more data, however...

I suspect I could add {{color id="0"}}two {{color id="-1"}}more gates.
Yes, then it'd hit maximum capacity.

So, I can create a link between the pad
and a second location, but for that I'd
need about {{color id="0"}}10 map-data locations{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Which should be a walk in the park
for someone like you!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}To be able to travel instantly to your
favorite place, use the {{color id="0"}}travel medallion{{color id="-1"}}
feature while standing on that spot.
Look in your {{color id="0"}}Key Items{{color id="-1"}} to see how many
travel gates you can establish. You
currently have the ability to make one.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I'd like to increase that to two, but
for that I'd need around {{color id="0"}}10 map-data
locations{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Given the maximum capacity, I could add
the ability to create {{color id="0"}}one{{color id="-1"}} more of those.

a third location, but for that I'd need

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Hero's path mode{{color id="-1"}} is an outstanding
addition if you do a lot of investigating!

It's a brilliant system that lets you see
the exact path you've taken!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But before I can install the prototype

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You select what you want from the

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Very good, showing interest in this

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's hard to get data on monsters without

"Sensor Instructions"


When moving toward a Shrine of Light
you haven't visited before, you'll hear a
sound that will alert you to its location.
The sound will be more frequent when
you're moving more directly toward
the shrine.
But the sound only goes off when you're
actually moving. So don't stop if you
want to keep following its lead.
If you want to stop the sensor from
finding shrines, push {{icon type="YButton" otherArg="0xCD"}} on the
map screen.

---
label: Pos_0200
---
"Sensor + Instructions"


You can detect things found in your
Hyrule Compendium in the same way that
you can detect shrines.
First, select what you what to detect
by pressing {{icon type="YButton" otherArg="0xCD"}} on the map screen.

Then you will hear a sound alerting you
to your target as you get nearer to it.

To change the target back to shrines,
press {{icon type="YButton" otherArg="0xCD"}} on the map screen.

Hero's Path Mode Instructions


Press {{icon type="XButton1" otherArg="0xCD"}} on the map screen to switch
Hero's Path Mode on and off.

It's a great feature that displays the path
you've traveled during your journey
on the map.
It will record up to 256 hours of path,
but as you exceed that, the oldest
parts of your path will be deleted.
You can also study your path to see
where you haven't yet gone. Those
places may have things left to discover!

Travel Medallion Instructions


The travel medallion feature lets you
create a travel gate at any spot you'd
like to return to instantly.
You'll see the number of gates you can
currently make in your Key Items.

A gate is easy to create! Go to the place
where you want to put it, then select the
travel medallion.
After that, you can travel to that spot
instantly by selecting it on the map,
just like you do with shrines.
If you delete a travel gate on the map,
you can then create a new one. So,
create them as often as you need to!
