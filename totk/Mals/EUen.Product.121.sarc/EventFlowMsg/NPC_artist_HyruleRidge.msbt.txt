This is interesting...

My art will be soaked...

Just until it stops.

Maybe I'll get some rest...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}This gets more fascinating the more
I look at it.{{delay8}} It seems that shape holds
some special meaning...{{delay15}}
Hm?

---
label: Talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh! {{delay15}}I was so engrossed in my work that
I didn't realize I had a fellow traveler to
converse with.{{pageBreak}}In case you couldn't tell, I'm a
painter.{{delay8}} I travel the world in search
of beautiful sights.
These mysterious floating islands are only
the most recent to catch my eye.{{pageBreak}}I was just painting that {{color id="0"}}small island{{color id="-1"}} there,
as a matter of fact.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Ever since the Upheaval, the sky has been
filled with floating islands.{{pageBreak}}But none has caught my fancy so much
as that exquisitely shaped one there.{{pageBreak}}I can't quite explain it, but it feels as
though it's speaking to me somehow.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}That shape really draws my eye...{{delay8}} Do you
think it's a natural formation? Or maybe...{{pageBreak}}Hm?

---
label: Talk_0007
---
Interested in my painting process,
are you?{{pageBreak}}I am fascinated by that {{color id="0"}}small island{{color id="-1"}} up
there.{{delay15}} I've made it my goal to capture
that distinct shape on canvas.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That {{color id="0"}}little island{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} The more I look at it,
the more its shape intrigues me...

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Why are the floating islands up there?{{delay8}}
It can't hurt to take a little time out of
your day to stop and think about it.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}What's on that distinctively shaped
island?{{delay8}} My imagination is running wild.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}There must be a reason why that island
has such a particular shape. {{delay8}}Don't
you think?

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Was that island's shape...carved out by
the wind?{{delay8}} Or could it have been... Hmm.

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}What if someone with powers beyond our
reckoning sent the island into the sky?{{delay15}}
I daydream about that sometimes.

---
label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}When I look up at that island, I get the
sense that someone intended it to be
used for something...

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I feel like I've seen a shape like that
somewhere...{{delay8}} Was it during my travels,
or in a dream?

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If somebody shaped the island that way...
they must have had a reason, right?

---
label: Talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Does the shape of that island represent
anything, you ask?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And I would answer...{{delay8}}that it is a flower!{{pageBreak}}It's my destiny to capture the essence of
this sky flora in paint, I'm sure of it!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}That's the thought that guides my brush
as it dances across the canvas.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it's you! The morning air is so
refreshing, isn't it?

label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it's you! There's no better traveling
treat than beautiful scenery. It really
revitalizes your soul.

label: Talk_0018

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it's you. Starting to get a little dark,
isn't it?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What nasty weather...

---
label: Talk_0009_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Got to take care not to get wet.

---
label: Talk_0009_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Just when I was getting into my painting...

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I can't see that {{color id="0"}}floating island {{color id="-1"}}in this
rotten weather...{{delay8}} I might as well rest
until it clears up.
I get it, you're young—you feel invincible.
But you'll feel much more vincible if you
come down with a cold!

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}The weather is making it impossible to see
that {{color id="0"}}small island{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}I hope it clears up soon.

---
label: Talk_0011_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've painted a lot of landscapes in my
time,{{delay8}} but none pique my curiosity like
that {{color id="0"}}small island{{color id="-1"}} up there.
Who put that strange little island up
there? {{delay15}}It's a fascinating shape. Easy to
paint too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You should go see it for yourself {{color id="0"}}once
the weather clears up a little{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}I guess I'll call it a day.

label: Talk_0012_00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I'll do the rest tomorrow.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}What should I paint tomorrow?

---
label: Talk_0012_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Oh, hello. {{delay15}}Always nice to meet a fellow
wanderer out here.{{pageBreak}}In case you couldn't tell, I'm a painter.{{delay8}}
I travel from place to place, looking for
scenery to inspire me.
Lately, I'm especially taken with the
{{color id="0"}}floating islands{{color id="-1"}} that have just appeared
in the sky.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've painted many landscapes in my life...{{delay8}}
but that{{color id="0"}} tiny island {{color id="-1"}}floating in the distance
may be the most mysterious of all.
Who put that strange little island up
there? {{delay15}}It's a fascinating shape. Easy to
paint too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You should go see it for yourself {{color id="0"}}once
the weather clears up a little{{color id="-1"}}!

label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Asleep or awake, {{delay15}}dreams of what might
await on that {{color id="0"}}tiny island{{color id="-1"}} occupy my
every thought.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hm... {{delay8}}There's something to that {{color id="0"}}little
island{{color id="-1"}}, but what?

---
label: Talk_0015_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm eager to continue my painting.

---
label: Talk_0015_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What could be the purpose of that tiny
island floating in the sky?

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it's you!{{delay15}} How are you holding up
against the heat? Preparation is key!

I wouldn't be able to paint here if not for
all the chilly elixirs I brewed in advance!

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, it's you.{{delay8}} The nights are cruel in this
region...{{delay15}} If you don't light a fire, the cold
will sap your strength away.

{{anim type="Trouble"}}Granted, you can't see it very well when
the clouds are in the way.
