{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thanks so much for your help finding
the Cuccos!

I'd hate for them to run away again,
so from now on, I'll be extra careful
when I take their eggs.
Thanks again for helping with that...
situation. I owe you one.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Did you come looking for {{color id="0"}}eggs{{color id="-1"}} too?


It seems like folks are allowed to pick
up the eggs here. What few are left
behind, at least.

With this rain drowning out our footsteps,

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}This rain will make it easier to sneak up
without the Cuccos taking notice. But
there aren't many eggs for the taking...

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I need one egg. Just one! Then I'll have
all the ingredients to make an {{color id="0"}}egg tart{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I think I'll give up for today and resume
the search for bird eggs tomorrow.

No skin off my nose! The longer I crave
it, the tastier that first bite of {{color id="0"}}egg tart{{color id="-1"}}
will be!

Egg tart?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You've never made an egg tart?
You don't know what you're missing!
Here—{{delay8}}try it!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, hang on, I forgot. I don't have one.
The ingredients are hard to get ahold of.

You need goat butter,{{delay8}} Tabantha wheat,{{delay8}}
cane sugar,{{delay8}} and a bird egg.

Goat butter's not hard to get. You can
buy it in Kakariko Village to the east or
Hateno Village to the southeast.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But like the name would imply, Tabantha
wheat only grows to the northwest in the
Tabantha region...
And cane sugar? The closest source is
{{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}} to the northeast.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You might say that sounds like a lot of
work for a tart, and...{{delay8}}you'd be right.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Did you already forget the recipe for
an egg tart?

You'll need bird eggs, of course. Those
can be picked up around here.

They sell goat butter in Kakariko Village
to the east and Hateno Village to the
southeast, so that's easy enough.
But Tabantha wheat only grows in the
Tabantha region up northwest...

And cane sugar is only sold in {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}
to the northeast.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Maybe put that recipe to paper. I'd hate
for you to do all that legwork only to
forget again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I will get those ingredients, no matter how
long it takes!{{delay15}} In this life, nothing worth
eating is easy to make!
I will not let up until that {{color id="0"}}egg tart {{color id="-1"}}is
resting safely in my stomach.
