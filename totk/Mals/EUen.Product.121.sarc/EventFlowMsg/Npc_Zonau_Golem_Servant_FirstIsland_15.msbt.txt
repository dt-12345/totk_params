{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This cave is especially dark.{{pageBreak}}You will need a light in order to proceed

Brightbloom seeds?

Yes, I do.

Brightbloom seeds?

---
label: 0004

Yes, I did.

label: talk_09

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes. I mentioned them before. They are
the seeds of a plant that grows natively

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}It seems you are unaware of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Their seeds bloom immediately from the
{{color id="0"}}impact{{color id="-1"}} of a sword or arrow.{{pageBreak}}The flowers {{color id="0"}}shrine brightly{{color id="-1"}} after blooming.{{delay8}}
This makes them useful as lights in dark

them to you otherwise.{{pageBreak}}My associates have picked the area past

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}That is excellent. {{delay15}}A light will be necessary
in order to see anything past here.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}Brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}} grow primarily in
{{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}There was a time once when they

by now. {{delay8}}My associates took most of them
due to their pressing needs.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do not forget to bring some if you intend
to venture inside.
