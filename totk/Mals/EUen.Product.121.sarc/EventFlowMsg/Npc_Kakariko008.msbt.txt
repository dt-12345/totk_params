{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}The previous chief planted these beautiful
plum trees on the day I was born.

They're...{{delay8}}a part of me. I take care of them
like I would take care of my own children.

Cori over with that survey team shows
my trees proper respect, so I let her use
part of my garden for her research.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}She uses it to grow something called a
{{color id="0"}}sundelion{{color id="-1"}}. It seems important, so I keep
careful watch and don't fuss with it.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Very well! Evidence indicates that
{{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}} come from the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}, so
it would be a triumph to grow them here.
Even better, our research also indicates
that consuming them may impart a

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oho, you really do like these {{color id="0"}}sundelions{{color id="-1"}}!


I can't say I understand all this {{color id="0"}}sky island{{color id="-1"}}
and {{color id="0"}}gloom{{color id="-1"}} business.

But if this plum garden is helping your
research, I'm pleased as can be.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Early test results indicate that consuming

The way they persevere through the

We Sheikah were once driven out of the

We consider plum trees the silent
