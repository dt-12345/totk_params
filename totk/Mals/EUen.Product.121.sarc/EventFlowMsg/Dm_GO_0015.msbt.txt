Young, little rock...

The gate you must pass through is firmly
locked with five padlocks.

---
label: Dm_GO_0015_Text_003_b
---
You have the power to unlock them all.
Do so, then the gate should open.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}No denyin'. I heard it loud and clear this
time. But who could it be?

And what did they mean by "young,
little rock"?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}They did tell us how to open the gate, so
they can't be all bad, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So all we gotta do is unlock the five locks,
and then we can get in there?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Did you see that? The gate—it moved a
little just now, goro!
