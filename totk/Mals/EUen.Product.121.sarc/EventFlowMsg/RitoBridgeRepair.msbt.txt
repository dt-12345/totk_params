We must rebuild the bridge.

What was his name again?

label: Talk_0001

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Now that the blizzard has passed,
I'd like to repair the bridge so that
supplies can arrive in the village.
Sadly, we're not equipped for a major
rebuilding project...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}But I've heard there are {{color id="0"}}Hylians {{color id="-1"}}who are
skilled in construction.{{pageBreak}}Say, you're a Hylian. Do you know anyone
who can help?

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}Sounds like you need a
good {{color id="0"}}carpenter{{color id="-1"}}.{{color id="0"}}{{pageBreak}}{{color id="-1"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I know! What about that guy at
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If he could build an incredible structure
like that, I bet he'll have no problem fixing
up your bridge!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}His name was... {{delay15}}Oh, shoot. I don't
remember. But it {{color id="0"}}ended in "son."{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Fantastic! Yes, he sounds up to the task.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}However, I can't leave the village right
now, what with my defense duties.{{pageBreak}}We'll have to dispatch an emissary to
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing {{color id="-1"}}in my place.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But who to send? Everyone's so busy...

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I bet the {{color id="0"}}carpenter{{color id="-1"}} at {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}
will be able to restore this bridge.{{pageBreak}}His name was... {{delay15}}Um...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Argh! It's on the tip of my tongue!{{pageBreak}}There's no use. All I can remember for
sure is that it {{color id="0"}}ends in "son."{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}That's all right. The information you've
given me is enough to go on.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If I could, I'd drop everything, head to
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}, and bring that Hylian
back here.
However, my defense duties come first.
I have to stay here for now and ensure
the village is safe.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Then again, a broken bridge is hardly
"safe," either. What to do...

---
label: Talk_0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}All right. Work at Lookout Landing is
nearly wrapped up.{{pageBreak}}Which also means I'm out of work...
You wouldn't know {{color id="0"}}anybody who needs
a carpenter{{color id="-1"}}, would you?

---
label: Talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Naturally, I'm worried about {{color id="0"}}Princess{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Zelda {{color id="-1"}}being seen at Hyrule Castle.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But what can I do about it? At the end of
the day, I'm just a carpenter.

The Rito's bridge...

No one comes to mind.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}They need someone to rebuild their
bridge, huh? {{delay8}}Sounds easy enough.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I heard it fell apart when that blizzard
struck Rito Village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But if they're looking to have it fixed, that
strange weather must've died down, eh?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well then, no time to gab. {{delay8}}I'll have that
bridge lookin' good as new in less than
no time! Son and done!

---
label: Talk_0057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah. {{delay15}}The bridge job you told me about?
Sounds easy enough.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I heard it fell apart when that blizzard
struck Rito Village.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But if they're looking to have it fixed, that
strange weather must've died down, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well then, no time to gab. {{delay8}}I'll have that

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Is that right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Well, if ever you need a guy who knows
his way around a hammer and nails, keep
me in mind!

---
label: Near_0002
---
It's worse than I thought...

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry, Karson. I wish we had more
building supplies for you to use.

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Now Gesane, this is my fault, not yours.


{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}I was too rosy with my estimates.

---
label: 0006
---
What happened?

---
label: 0007
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk_0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can't believe the bridge is in such a
sorry state...

---
label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. It's about the bridge job.


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}We've hit a bit of a snag. See, the thing's
in worse shape than I accounted for.

---
label: Talk_0042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Karson here estimates that we're short
{{color id="0"}}20 pieces of wood{{color id="-1"}}. Is that right?

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yep. We may be able to get what we
need by chopping down trees.

But that'll be a whole project in itself.

---
label: 0002
---
Here you go.

---
label: 0003
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So what do we do? A sticky sitch, this.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hm? It's wood! 20 pieces of it!


Must've been a real pain in the neck
collecting that on your own. {{delay8}}You sure I
can have it?

---
label: Near_0004
---
We're short on wood...

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I had no idea this job would be so big that
it needed {{color id="0"}}20 pieces of wood{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}In retrospect, this is a bridge we're talking
about, so I guess it makes sense...

---
label: Talk_0063
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We may be able to get what we need from
the trees around here.

But to get all that lumber, we'll be
chopping for days...

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}There's some wood stockpiled at the
newspaper office, but not enough to
rebuild the bridge.
I guess our only option is to chop down
some of the trees around here... Urgh...

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}We were so focused on gathering food
that we let our stockpile of building
materials go practically empty.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We can't even scrounge up {{color id="0"}}20 pieces
of wood{{color id="-1"}}? It's shameful.{{pageBreak}}Karson traveled all this way, and we have
nothing for him to work with.

---
label: Talk_0062
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I appreciate the sentiment, but in this
case it's not the thought that counts.
It's the {{color id="0"}}wood{{color id="-1"}}. We need {{color id="0"}}20 pieces {{color id="-1"}}of it.
Perhaps we can get what we need by
chopping down trees here.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But that's going to be a project in itself.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}All right! That's all the materials!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Come on, Gesane! Time to fix this busted
bridge of yours! Son and done!

---

Gesane, let's plonk this down a little
farther to the left... {{delay15}}Not that far!

---
label: Talk_0059

It's falling down the cliff! {{delay8}}Timberrr!{{delay15}}

---

Pheeew! Good catch. {{delay15}}Those wings sure
come in handy, eh? Or...wingy.

Hey, don't set your tail down there!{{delay8}}
It's a support beam, not a perch!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And now, for the finishing touch!{{pageBreak}}{{delay15}}Here goes...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}The bridge... It's finished!

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Amazing! Fantastic! Now we can carry
supplies across!

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I gotta say, I was a little worried about
how it'd turn out. But what a beaut!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You could hit this bridge with 10
blizzards at once, and it wouldn't
so much as creak!

---
label: Talk_0052
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}With that done, life in Rito Village should
return to something like normal.

I will take responsibility for guarding the
bridge. Please, accept this gift.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I had that money set aside for repairing
the bridge, but I hope you'll get some use
out of it.

---
label: Talk_0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And with that, I'm off to Lookout Landing.

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Gesane, if you ever need my help, just
say the word and I'll come running.
No problem's too small.

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Thank you. That's very reassuring.{{pageBreak}}And the same goes for you. You have an
open invitation to call upon our help.
