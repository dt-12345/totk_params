{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Aha! ♪I know that face! Yes, that's a
face I know!♪

Traveler! Have you come to meet with
another {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk1041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}If you keep distracting me, I won't be
able to conduct properly!

And without my conducting, the players
won't know what to do!

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Er? {{delay8}}How odd. {{delay8}}They're going on without me.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}W-well, never mind, then. {{delay8}}Are you that
interested in the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy Kaysa{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0005
---
Great Fairy?

---
label: Talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}No? Am I wrong?


You're not here to meet with the
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy Kaysa{{color id="-1"}}? Perhaps you came
here to visit Outskirt Stable.

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sorry to say the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} here
has also withdrawn into her flower bud
and hasn't come out in a while.
She must be scared to appear, just like
what happened at Woodland Stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This Great Fairy used to enjoy hearing
{{color id="0"}}Pyper{{color id="-1"}} play in our troupe. She loved the
sweet notes of {{color id="0"}}his flute{{color id="-1"}}.
So, I'm sure the{{color id="0"}} sound of his flute{{color id="-1"}} would
cheer her up now,{{delay8}} but...

---
label: Talk1048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm afraid Pyper...{{delay8}}isn't with us right now...

---
label: Talk1033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Sure enough, this {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} has also{{delay8}}
withdrawn into her flower bud.

She used to enjoy hearing {{color id="0"}}the sound of
Pyper's flute{{color id="-1"}}, but...

---
label: Talk1040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}{{color id="0"}}The road has been blocked{{color id="-1"}} by some rocks
that tumbled out of the sky.

I thought maybe we could drive over it,
and we did make it about halfway.

But the rubble's just too much trouble.
{{color id="0"}}No horses can get past it.{{color id="-1"}} {{delay8}}And our little
jaunt took its toll, alas...

---
label: Talk1034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Poor Breezer, the indispensable sixth
member of our troupe, has broken down
yet again.
Our Breezer has seen us through thick
and thin. {{delay8}}Without it, our hearts won't be
in our performance.

---
label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh, Pyper is a young flautist with the
Stable Trotters.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But one day he took his leave from the
troupe, and we haven't seen him since.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}A traveler from {{color id="0"}}Faron{{color id="-1"}} to the southeast said they
heard the {{color id="0"}}sound of a flute{{color id="-1"}} at {{color id="0"}}Highland Stable{{color id="-1"}}, but...{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0006
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Yes, goodbye...


{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Wait, goodbye?! But we only just
said hello!

No goodbyes for you until I tell you
about the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk1043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} If your path happens to take you in
{{color id="0"}}the direction of Faron{{color id="-1"}}...

Maybe you could make a quick stop at
{{color id="0"}}Highland Stable{{color id="-1"}} and ask about the {{color id="0"}}sound
of that flute{{color id="-1"}}?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But if you're not going that way, {{delay8}}don't
trouble yourself on my account.

---
label: Talk1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah! It's you! {{delay8}}Look—I mean listen—to this!


Pyper's here! Our flautist Pyper has made
his triumphant return!

---
label: Talk1045
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Who knew how smitten Pyper really was?


{{size value="80"}}Not I. Affairs of the heart are something I've yet
to experience firsthand.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Well, anyway.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}The return of Pyper's delightful flute has
revitalized the Stable Trotters! We're
ready to make some music!

---
label: Talk1046
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But I'd better save some energy for the
performance and not fritter it all away
on chatting.
By the way...{{delay8}}I remember you, traveler.
Are you here out of concern for the
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm thankful {{color id="0"}}Pyper {{color id="-1"}}has returned...{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}


But I'm so worried about the Great Fairy
that{{delay8}}...I just can't lead the players with
my usual flair.

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I can't possibly abandon the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}...


Pyper has returned, and I'm sure she will
enjoy his performance.


---
label: Talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I can't remember the last time I saw the
Great Fairy come out of her flower bud.

I believe the exquisite tones of Pyper's
flute would rouse her, but...

---
label: Talk1047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is at the top of that hill.


The green flower bud is the landmark to
look out for. Let's head to her quickly,
and with a song in our hearts!

---
label: Talk1035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is at the top of that hill.

---
label: Talk1039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I tried many different ways to find a safe
path to that destination. 

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}They all ended in failure. Worse yet, our
poor Breezer broke down.

---
label: Talk1036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Without dear {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}, our hearts just
aren't in our performances.

But how else are we meant to get {{color id="0"}}near
the Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0000

Get in. I'll handle it.

---
label: 0001
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I have been waiting for those very words!

---
label: Talk1028
---
Everyone, get on board before he
changes his mind!

---
label: Talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Is there trouble?! I do hate trouble!

---
label: 0002
---
Let's take it from the top.

---
label: 0003
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: 0007
---
The Great Fairy?

---
label: Talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This seems dangerous. Go back, go back!

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's always a thrill to ride to our next
destination!

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Greaaat Fairyyy! We're here!{{size value="100"}}


Now prepare for the performance of
a lifetime!

---
label: Talk1016

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Look, Pyper, look! She's awakened!

---
label: Talk1017

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oooh. I didn't know she'd be so shiny!

---
label: Talk1038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Thank you again!

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I have a reward for you, and it's too much
for these pockets to handle.

No need to be humble. You deserve this!

---
label: Talk1027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}That's better. {{delay8}}Now I can concentrate on
our performance!

---
label: Talk1049
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The captivating Kaysa is now at peace!


But she wasn't the last Great Fairy still
shut away in her flower bud.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}That's why the show must go on to the
next Great Fairy's hiding place!

Thank you once again, traveler!

Oh, how troubling!

He came back to us!

My heart is racing...

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}How dangerous! I thought I'd be reunited
with my dear, old grandpapa if that went
on much longer.
We'd better try that again.
