at the moment. But if you want to sell
something, let me know!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I've got some wares that would be useful
for someone like you, Mr. Hero!

If you use a brightbloom seed in a dark
place, it'll light up the area. I bet you'd
find that handy, huh!

happy to have a look at it.
