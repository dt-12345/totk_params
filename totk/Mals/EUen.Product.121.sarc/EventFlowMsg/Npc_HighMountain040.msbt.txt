{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If there's something you want to know
about {{color id="0"}}shield surfing{{color id="-1"}}, all you have to do
is ask.
We're great {{color id="0"}}shield surfers{{color id="-1"}}, as you can
probably tell just from looking at us!

What's shield surfing?

label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Shield surfing is kind of like sledding,
except you're standing on a {{color id="0"}}shield {{color id="-1"}}instead
of sitting on a sled. It's a rush!
Best of all, you can surf over snowy
patches that aren't traversable by foot.

Is there a trick to it?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmmm...{{delay8}} You do want to {{color id="0"}}build up
momentum {{color id="-1"}}before you kick off.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Personally, I like to get a running start
or surf down a hill.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Anything else you want to know? My
husband and I are fonts of shield-surfing
know-how!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Hehe, I like your passion for the subject!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's important to {{color id="0"}}have some momentum{{color id="-1"}}
before you kick off. {{delay8}}It's hard to explain
until you get the trick to it.{{pageBreak}}I find it helps to get a running start or surf
down a hill.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ah, heading out? I guess we should, too,
now that there aren't any more monsters
to worry about.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You know, I wonder if the stories of the
{{color id="0"}}legendary shield surfer {{color id="-1"}}are true.{{pageBreak}}I know nothing about them, except that
they're rumored to be in the {{color id="0"}}Hebra
Mountains {{color id="-1"}}up north. Might be dangerous.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You did it! Thanks for saving our
hides. Again.{{pageBreak}}It was cold, so we decided to make {{color id="0"}}spicy
elixir{{color id="-1"}}. But by the time it was ready, the
monsters were everywhere again.
I know! Why don't you take it?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ah, but that's... {{delay15}}I made that...

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ugh, you and your whining! Just
make more!{{pageBreak}}All you need are {{color id="0"}}monster parts {{color id="-1"}}and
{{color id="0"}}warm materials{{color id="-1"}}. I mean, yeesh...
