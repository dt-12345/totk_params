{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Well! You're a new face round here, if I'm
any judge. Welcome to Hateno Pasture!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Nothing like morning air on a farm, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Love to get some sun. Don't my cows look

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Sure you are. The milk from my cows is
the best in Hateno! The secret's in the

Here's some acorns.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll need
more than a kind gesture. It takes at least
