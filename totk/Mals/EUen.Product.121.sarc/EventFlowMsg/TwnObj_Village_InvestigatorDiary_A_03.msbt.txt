The Stone Slab at the Eastern Ring Ruin:
Some Translation Notes
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 　-Tauro
"Wind, flame, water, lightning...and
time... Light... Who holds the power...
secret stone...and...{{pageBreak}}"That person...dwell within...power... 
amplify... Great...might...display..."{{pageBreak}}The thrust of the message on this slab is
about something called secret stones.{{pageBreak}}"Those who held powers such as wind,
flame, water, lightning—and light and
time—amplified them with secret stones.{{pageBreak}}"They used the stones to attain great
might to accomplish their goals."{{pageBreak}}That's what I'm guessing it would say if
we could read the whole thing.
