{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hi, Link! {{delay15}}Here to see how the village
is doing?

label: Talk00_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, hi, Link. {{delay15}}Good to see you here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'll keep getting stronger and stronger
until the day comes when we can fight
together again!{{pageBreak}}I'm a descendant of the Sage of Wind,
after all. I'm not going to be the one who
holds you back, Link!{{pageBreak}}I'm worried about Princess Zelda too, so
I'll keep looking into things from this end.

label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'll take care of Rito Village, so don't you
worry about it at all. Leave it to me!{{pageBreak}}And I'll look into the whole Princess Zelda
thing as much as I can while I'm at it!

label: Talk02

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Guess I'm more tired than I thought.
I'm heading back home to rest a bit.{{pageBreak}}I need to keep the Great Eagle Bow my
dad gave me in tip-top shape too!

label: Talk06

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay8}}Where do you think the {{color id="0"}}slumbering
treasure {{color id="-1"}}is? {{delay8}}Could it really be hidden
somewhere in the Hebra Mountains?

---
label: Talk10_00_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh?! {{delay8}}No way... {{delay15}}You found the {{color id="0"}}hidden
treasure{{color id="-1"}} in the center of the three secret
hot springs?!

---
label: Talk10_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh?! {{delay8}}No way... {{delay8}}Are you wearing the
{{color id="0"}}hidden treasure{{color id="-1"}} that was supposed to be
at the center of the three hot springs?!

---
label: Talk10
---
So it was real after all...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Good thing I found that riddle, huh?{{delay8}}
Way to go, Link!

---
label: Talk10_01

So it was real after all...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I don't know how you already found the
treasure, {{delay8}}but way to go, Link!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I think this was meant for a sage, but it
looks too heavy for me. {{delay8}}Maybe it'll fit
once I'm older.{{pageBreak}}There's definitely some kind of power
stored up in it. {{delay15}}Maybe if you wore it, it'd
make your connection to me stronger.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Yeah! {{delay15}}You should be the one to use
the helm!{{pageBreak}}That power it has is bound to be useful
in your search for Princess Zelda!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Embarrassed_00"}}My spirit is always with you, Link.{{delay15}}
If you're ever in trouble, I'll help you
out first thing!

Hmm...

label: Talk04

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}We're still searching for Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}But there haven't been any new leads.
If we figure anything out, though, you'll
be the first to know!

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}So, Princess Zelda has been in the past
all along. And she's been fighting the
whole time!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[6,0]"}}All we can do for her now is gather as
much information as we can about the
{{color id="0"}}fifth sage{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'll do what I can to look into any ruins
from the age of legends!

in ruins from the age of legends. I'll keep

this, Link, but at least you've got my
power to lean on whenever you need it!{{pageBreak}}I'll be right here, patrolling the village

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay15}}You found {{color id="0"}}the fifth sage{{color id="-1"}}?!{{pageBreak}}So she's an ancient Zonai...{{delay15}}but there's
just the spirit left?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I can't wrap my mind around it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}But it sounds like we can count on her!{{delay15}}
Good job finding her, Link.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}It's finally time to take on the Demon
King! {{delay15}}I need to brace myself for a real
fight, huh?

time to take on the Demon King!{{pageBreak}}I'd better brace myself for a doozy of
a final battle.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'll be fighting right there with you, Link.{{delay8}}
