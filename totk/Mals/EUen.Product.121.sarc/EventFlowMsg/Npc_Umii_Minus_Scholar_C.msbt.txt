{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh?{{delay8}} What's with the outfit?{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}Or...{{delay8}} No. I should act surprised that someone
showed up...{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Get it together, me...{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Oh? {{delay8}}Did you pass the interview too?


{{size value="80"}}He obviously did. Why else would he come strolling
into a place like this? Ugh, why'd I even bring it up?{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Er...{{delay8}}just forget it. It's not important.


What is important is this text we're
investigating. It's fascinating.

It claims that this stone statue should be
able to grant us an "{{color id="0"}}ancient power{{color id="-1"}}."

Ancient power?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That's right. This {{color id="0"}}peculiar stone statue{{color id="-1"}}
is nothing less than one of the fabled
{{color id="0"}}constructs{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In fact, I have some writing here that
explains this so-called "{{color id="0"}}ancient power{{color id="-1"}}"
in detail.
It reads, {{delay8}}"This ability will allow you
to commit {{color id="0"}}any structure you create{{color id="-1"}}
to memory.
"Any object committed to memory
can be {{color id="0"}}instantly reproduced{{color id="-1"}}."

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_01"}}Just think of it! If we could instantly
re-create anything we'd ever made...

the Yi—{{delay15}} Er, I mean, the survey team's,
uh...investigation of this land would be
swift and unstoppable!
The text further claims that this construct
should be able to grant us that power.
Oh, we just have to wake it up!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Indeed. {{delay8}}Apparently, it allows you to
{{color id="0"}}instantly build something{{color id="-1"}}, as long as it's
something that you've built before.
That {{color id="0"}}strange stone statue{{color id="-1"}} is a "{{color id="0"}}construct{{color id="-1"}}"
that can supposedly grant us that power.

But we don't know how to wake it up.{{delay8}}
Hmm...{{delay8}} There has to be some way to get
it to respond, right?

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This {{color id="0"}}strange stone statue{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} It must be
the construct that grants us the{{color id="0"}} power{{color id="-1"}}
we're after, but...
Hmmm... How do we get it?

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}If the {{color id="0"}}text {{color id="-1"}}is correct, then this construct
should hold the{{color id="0"}} power{{color id="-1"}} we seek...
