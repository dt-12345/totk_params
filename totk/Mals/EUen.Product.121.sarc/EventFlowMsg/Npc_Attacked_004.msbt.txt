{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}{{size value="80"}}So, if I gather my thoughts, what I know is this...


The {{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}} is more than fable and far
closer to fact.

Can it truly defeat any monster? Does it truly exist
in Hyrule? Yes and yes.

And it's highly likely to be found in the
{{color id="0"}}something-something woods{{color id="-1"}}.{{size value="100"}}

{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Huh?

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Tell me, you. How long have you
been there?

You didn't happen to...{{delay8}}overhear what
I was just saying, did you?

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hang on. You're still there?


You didn't happen to...{{delay8}}overhear what
I was just saying, did you?

Legendary sword?

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ha, well... {{delay8}}You heard. I thought as much.{{delay8}}
But I have nothing to fear.

I stand comforted that only the chosen
one can wield the {{color id="0"}}legendary sword {{color id="-1"}}that
defeats any monster.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The chosen one isn't an eavesdropper.
He is an eave that is perfectly fine with
being dropped in on. Me, I mean.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Ah, let me share this openly... {{delay8}}Some
days ago, I bid farewell to my dear wife,
Sorelia, to set out from Lakeside Stable.
I find myself now at this stable, but the
{{color id="0"}}something-something woods{{color id="-1"}} that I
seek is still far away.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}So, forgive me if I have no more time
for eavesdroppers. I have to find the
legendary sword to protect my dear wife.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Did you not hear me? My fault entirely.


{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}The {{color id="0"}}legendary sword {{color id="-1"}}is meant for a
chosen one, like me.

I couldn't hear a thing.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Ah! Not a word of it? Well then...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Please, forgive me. I went to great trouble
to learn about the {{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}} that
can defeat any monster.
If I sounded unwelcoming, it's only
because I find myself on a personal
journey of some urgency.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Ah, here is my story...{{delay8}} Some days ago,
I bid farewell to my dear wife, Sorelia, to
set out from Lakeside Stable.
I finally reached this stable, but I seek the
{{color id="0"}}something-something woods {{color id="-1"}}that are
still far away.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_01"}}I must find this legendary sword!{{delay15}} I must
protect my dear wife from all danger!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Hold on there. You didn't happen to...
hear what I was saying, did you?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Please, forgive me. I went to great trouble
to learn about the {{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}} that
can defeat any monster.
If I sounded unwelcoming in the slightest,
it's only because I find myself on a
personal journey of some urgency.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I must protect my dear wife, Sorelia, from
any and all harm.

To do that, I must find that sword in the
{{color id="0"}}something-something woods{{color id="-1"}} soon. Only
then may I return to my wife's side!

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Ah, I shared more than I should have. But
I needn't fear. It...doesn't seem like a
{{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}} is part of your destiny.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}From what I've learned so far, a
{{color id="0"}}legendary sword {{color id="-1"}}exists somewhere
in Hyrule.
And it's highly likely to be found in the
{{color id="0"}}something-something woods{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}So, that much I know, but where might
woods of a something-something
nature be?
I have to find the sword soon and return
to my wife, Sorelia, at Lakeside Stable.

My dear, dear wife...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What? {{delay8}}Th-that sword!


Could it be...the {{color id="0"}}legendary sword{{color id="-1"}}?

That's right.

---
label: Talk_0051

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Ah, no. But it can't be. Y-you're
joking, right?

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}But...{{delay8}}uh...{{delay8}}is it?{{delay8}} It is.{{delay8}} The sword of legend.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I... {{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}I see...{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}} So, you got to it first.


And the fact that you're wielding
the sword means that YOU are the
chosen one.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}All right, then!{{delay8}} Let it be known that you
are an important person, {{delay8}}because the
legendary sword protects such persons!
Now, I must protect my important wife,
Sorelia!{{delay8}} I vow to get a worthy weapon in
place of the legendary sword!

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Ah... {{delay8}}I imagine that Sorelia is all alone,
waiting for my return.

I must find the legendary sword and
return to her side as soon as I can.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You were the one to be entrusted with
the legendary sword!{{delay8}} That sword protects
important people.
