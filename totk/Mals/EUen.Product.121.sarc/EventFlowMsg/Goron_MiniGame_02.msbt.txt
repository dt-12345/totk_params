label: Talk37

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If ya wanna play something laid-back,
talk to {{color id="0"}}Bayge{{color id="-1"}}!

If you're lookin' for something that packs
a punch, I recommend {{color id="0"}}Kabetta's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}Death
Mountain course{{color id="-1"}}!
My course is smack dab in the middle—
not too easy and not too hard.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}With your skills, you might even be able
to beat {{color id="0"}}Kabetta{{color id="-1"}}'s course.

If you're curious, he's up at the {{color id="0"}}peak of{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk18
