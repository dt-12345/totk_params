Oh, we have one of those!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey there! Welcome to {{color id="0"}}Riverside Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now then, as this is your first use of
Riverside Stable...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Not only are we celebrating your first use
of Riverside Stable but you've also
{{color id="0"}}registered a horse{{color id="-1"}}, so...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}To celebrate your first use of Riverside
Stable and your {{color id="0"}}lodging with us{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}That's right! {{delay8}}Have you already been to
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}out {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}}?

Kakariko Village is located between two
steep mountains, so visitors to the village
used to be few and far between.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}However, ever since those distinctive
{{color id="0"}}ring-shaped Zonai ruins {{color id="-1"}}landed there,{{delay8}}
things have been pretty lively!

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Aha. Our decoration caught your fancy,
did it? Clearly you have a discerning eye!

That lovely little wreath is a souvenir from
nearby {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

The artisan apparently based it on the
unusual ring-shaped Zonai ruins that
landed over there.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If you'd like one to take with you, it's only
a short trip {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}!

There's a {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}just nearby, so
I can't imagine you'll have any trouble
finding the place.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}If you're really that taken with our
{{color id="0"}}ring garland{{color id="-1"}}, you should get one of
your own in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's right near the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower {{color id="-1"}}east of
our stable, so I don't think you'll have any
trouble finding it.

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you like our {{color id="0"}}ring garland {{color id="-1"}}that much,
then maybe you should go to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}} and buy your own.
It's near the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}} to the east,
so it shouldn't take you long to figure out
your way there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My mind is made up. I know just what to
hang on that wall...{{delay8}}a picture of a mystical,
blessed, {{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}}!
Oh, and if you're not already aware,{{delay8}} the
"great" in the name refers to how BIG
these statues are.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}They're quietly enshrined throughout
Hyrule, but not many people know their
exact locations...
The closest Great Goddess Statue to us
allegedly stands in a temple {{color id="0"}}southwest of
Hyrule Field{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}But all my search attempts have come
up empty. {{delay8}}Maybe it's somewhere that's
difficult to get to by horse...
But I don't need to see the real thing!{{delay8}}
If I had a drawing of the Great Goddess
Statue, I could copy it down and put it up!

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Wait...{{delay8}} You have a {{color id="0"}}picture of a Great
Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statues{{color id="-1"}} stand tall
and tranquil, quietly watching over all
of Hyrule.
If I could paint a picture of one of them
for my wall, I'm sure it would keep our
stable peaceful too.
Apparently there's a Great Goddess
Statue enshrined in a sacred place
to the {{color id="0"}}southwest of Hyrule Field{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I sure can't find it.{{delay8}} It might be in a
place that's difficult to get to by horse.

label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statues{{color id="-1"}} stand tall and
tranquil, quietly enshrined all over Hyrule.

If I could paint a picture of one to watch
over my stable, I bet it would make this
place feel even more peaceful.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Did you bring me a {{color id="0"}}picture of
a Great Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Even a drawing would be fine. As long as
I could just see a {{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}}
I could copy it down and hang it up!

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you've got {{color id="0"}}a picture of a Great Goddess
Statue {{color id="-1"}}somewhere, please show me!

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's a real blessing,{{delay8}} having an image of a
Great Goddess Statue watching over us.
Towering over us, really!
If you'd prefer a different angle or even a
different {{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}}, I'm happy
to copy and display a new one too.
Simply give me the word, and show me
the new picture!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Whoa...{{delay8}} She is...TREMENDOUS!{{delay8}} Both in
terms of size and tranquil beauty!

What a divine figure she cuts!{{delay8}} It's as if my
heart is fuller just looking at her!

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, Link, with the gift of one blessed
painting,{{delay8}} you've wrapped this stable in
a warm, cozy light.
With this Great Goddess Statue adorning
our walls, I'm sure the Goddess herself
will be watching over our visitors!

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, yes, was there something you wanted
with the {{color id="0"}}Great Goddess Statue painting{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}When I think that the Great Goddess
Statue is watching over me, it makes me
want to work a bit harder than usual!

---
label: 9006

Replace it.

It's fine how it is.
