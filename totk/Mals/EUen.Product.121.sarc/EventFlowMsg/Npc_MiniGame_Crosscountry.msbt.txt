This is ridiculous...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Look, I'm sorry, OK? I'll make your little
uniforms without any more complaints,
I swear!
Hold up...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey...{{delay8}}hey, superstar. You're not with the
Yiga Clan, are you?

Please tell me you're here to rescue me.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's—{{delay8}} That's fantastic! Ugh, I've been
cooped up in here forever.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The name's Konba.


I've got a knack for style and the nimble
digits I need to spin my ideas into reality.

Alas, that pure talent is why the Yiga Clan
kidnapped me and forced me to make
their outfits for them.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If I ever sew one of those tacky rags
again, it'll be too soon.{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}In fact, you should take the {{color id="0"}}Yiga armor{{color id="-1"}}
I just finished. Burn it, toss it, do what
you want. Just get it away from me.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hold on.{{delay15}} Your pouch is full.{{pageBreak}}Well, I'll just put this in a box so the Yiga
Clan won't find it. You can come back and
get it once you've made room.

label: Talk_0003

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The look may lack, but my tailoring is
sublime. If you {{color id="0"}}wore the whole set{{color id="-1"}}, you'd
fit right in with the Yiga Clan.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}On that note, I gotta hurry out of here
before they get back.

Don't worry, I'm more athletic than I look.
They only caught me last time because I
messed up. It won't happen again.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}See you round, and thanks for the save!

close.{{delay8}} Thanks for the superstar save!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That was amazing! {{delay8}}Look, I call a lot of
people "superstar," but you really earn it!{{delay8}}
Thank you!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Nope, nope, nope.{{delay15}} Don't you come talk to
me looking like that. I can't be seen with
someone who cares so little for clothing.
I'm not saying you have to dress fancy,
but at least put on a shirt or some
trousers, you know?
