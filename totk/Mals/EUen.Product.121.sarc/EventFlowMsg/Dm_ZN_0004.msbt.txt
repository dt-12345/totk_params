{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} are the most intriguing
ruins I've researched. Especially this one,
the way part of it {{color id="0"}}floats {{color id="-1"}}up there.
You had the foresight to focus on all of
these special ruins and invite the survey
team to take a look right away.
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm impressed, Chief Paya!

---
label: talk_0004
---
{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Oh, no, I... I'm no chief. I just couldn't
refuse my predecessor when she decided
to pass the title to me rather suddenly.
I'm really a chief in name only, since I still
have a great deal to...{{delay15}} Hm?

---
label: talk_0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Is that you, Master Link?!

---
label: talk_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I'm so happy that I get to see you again!

---
label: talk_0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_02"}}I'm overjoyed that both you and Princess
Zelda are safe, Master Link.

---
label: talk_0089
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What? {{delay8}}Princess Zelda is still missing?


That just...{{delay8}}confuses the matter more.{{delay8}}
You see, {{delay8}}I actually met with the princess
not too long ago.

---
label: talk_0129
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It was immediately after the Upheaval.


Princess Zelda came here to
Kakariko Village.

---
label: talk_0091
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}She ordered us all to stay far away
from the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin that floats {{color id="-1"}}above us,
no matter what.{{delay8}}
I saw her myself—the princess, right
before my eyes.

---
label: talk_0093
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}She {{color id="0"}}left as soon as she arrived{{color id="-1"}}. I wasn't
able to ask her anything more about
those unusual instructions.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We thought it was to protect the villagers
from harm. This ruin does look like it
could crash down at any moment.
That's what Paya and I suspect at least.

---
label: talk_0125
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But still, I know you would not misspeak,
Master Link, especially on a matter of
such importance. How confusing...

---
label: talk_0095
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Oh! My apologies, Master Link!{{delay8}} I was so
pleased to see you, I completely forgot
common courtesy.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Please allow me to introduce Mr. Tauro,
an esteemed member of the Zonai
Survey Team.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I invited him here to investigate the
Ring Ruins that fell on our village.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}He has incredibly deep knowledge of the
Zonai civilization...{{delay8}}

He's even familiar with Zonai script! He is
truly an incredibly talented individual.

---
label: talk_0127
---
{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's clear that the {{color id="0"}}floating Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}that
we were forbidden to explore is a unique
and incredibly valuable find.

---
label: talk_0097
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Several more Ring Ruins with such
a shape have fallen down around
the village.
Most have broken apart in some way.
What's fascinating is that a stone slab
with writing was found at each site.
Deciphering the text showed that each
slab contains rather interesting content,
including mention of "sages."
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}There's still so much we don't
understand...

---
label: talk_0098
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I think that perhaps the ruin floating in the
air also has a slab that makes mention of
the sages!

---
label: talk_0130
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I can't investigate, as that would go
against Princess Zelda's direct orders.

If only I could meet with her again,
I'm sure I could persuade her to
change her mind.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In any case, I'm having trouble squaring
your story about Princess Zelda with the
Princess Zelda we met.{{pageBreak}}If everything is all right, why won't she
just show herself?

---
label: talk_0102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}She must have some reason!


Until we find out Princess Zelda's true
intentions, we have no choice but to
trust her and leave that ruin alone.

---
label: talk_0071
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Are you thinking about the floating
Ring Ruin?{{delay8}}

I am as well. It has been on our minds
for some time.

---
label: talk_0072
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We would like to suggest resuming the
research, if we may.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you since figured out what became
of Princess Zelda?

---
label: talk_0073
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Wh-{{delay8}}what?{{delay8}} The Zelda who appeared after
the Upheaval was a creation of the
Demon King?
And the real Princess Zelda still hasn't
been found?

But...{{delay8}} How can this be true?

---
label: talk_0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's such an unbelievable tale, and yet... 


I trust you completely, Master Link. It
must be as you say.

It is hard to explain, but the princess we
saw was somehow unfamiliar... It was as
though her very aura was different.

---
label: talk_0075
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}But if she was an impostor the whole
time...{{delay15}}that would mean...{{pageBreak}}The real reason she ordered us to close
off the floating Ring Ruin was...

---
label: talk_0122
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Because the Demon King saw it as
a threat!{{delay15}} Isn't that right?!

That only means one thing. {{delay8}}We should
investigate the floating Ring Ruin
immediately!

---
label: talk_0076
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}You are exactly right! There is no longer
any reason to prohibit your research.

Let's open up the floating Ring Ruin at
once, Mr. Tauro!

---
label: talk_0104
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Knowledge is tugging on the line!{{pageBreak}}Time to reel in some results!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk_0119
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Hee-hee.{{delay8}} Your Lurelin phrasing is coming
through, Mr. Tauro.{{delay8}} You must really
be pleased!

---
label: talk_0079
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's just...{{delay8}} Hmm. There's one problem.{{delay8}}
We still need to determine how to
conduct the survey.

---
label: talk_0080
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It's clear that the interior of this Ring
Ruin is hollow.

Sadly, there doesn't seem to be
an entrance.

---
label: talk_0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If the contents of the other Ring Ruins
are any indication...

There should be {{color id="0"}}a stone slab inside
engraved with Zonai script{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_0108
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}First, we should look for a way to {{color id="0"}}confirm
that there's a stone slab inside{{color id="-1"}}.

However, we also don't want to damage
these precious ruins...

---
label: talk_0126
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Oh, pardon me. I was lost in thought.
I'd better hurry and tell everyone about
this so we can open up the ruins.

---
label: talk_0109
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hm?{{delay8}} The Zelda who appeared after
the Upheaval is an impostor born of
the Demon King?
And the real Princess Zelda is
still missing?!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Are you serious, Master Link?! It's
certainly hard to believe...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Yet I find it impossible that you would
make up such a thing.{{delay8}} Hmm...{{delay15}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Come to think of it, {{delay8}}the Princess Zelda
who came to Kakariko Village...

---
label: talk_0111
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}She ordered us not to let anyone go near
that {{color id="0"}}floating Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}}, no matter what.

---
label: talk_0115
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Until now, I'd given up on investigating
the ruin, believing Princess Zelda's orders
were for the best.
But if that princess was an impostor,
that changes everything.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Princess Zelda's impostor...the Demon
King's underling...forbade anyone from
investigating the floating Ring Ruin.
That must mean that doing so would pose
a threat to the Demon King!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If that is the case, we must survey that
floating Ring Ruin as soon as possible!

---
label: talk_0116
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Right you are, Mr. Tauro.{{delay8}} There is no
longer any reason to prohibit your
research.
Let's open up the floating Ring Ruin
at once!

---
label: talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Honestly, I was taken aback when I heard
that Princess Zelda was an impostor.
That's a lot to swallow, you know?
But I'm so glad that I can finally start my
long-cherished research on the floating
Ring Ruin!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The only trouble is...I still can't figure out
{{color id="0"}}a way to see the stone slab inside{{color id="-1"}}. I can't
condone breaking these precious ruins.
This riddle is a tough one, to be sure.{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Still, my hook's baited now, and I'm not
letting go until I get a bite!

---
label: near_0004
---
What to do, what to do...

---
label: talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? {{delay8}}Am I imagining things? {{delay8}}It looks like
you just slipped into the ruins.

No, forget I said anything. It must have
been a trick of the light.

---
label: talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's a silly thought, but I wish I could see
a {{color id="0"}}picture of the inside{{color id="-1"}}.

What a fanciful idea, eh?

---
label: talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Did you really find a way inside the
floating Ring Ruin?!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Sorry, but I have to get this off my chest.{{delay8}}
If it were that easy to get in, I wouldn't be
in such turmoil here. I'm not buying it.
Now, if you{{color id="0"}} showed me a picture of
the inside{{color id="-1"}}, I'd believe you. That would
really help out the research team!

---
label: talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Speaking of pictures, I've heard a rumor
that Robbie made a {{color id="0"}}mechanism that turns
scenery into images{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I could use it to get a good depiction of
the ruin's exterior, though what I'd really
love is to capture whatever's inside.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Perhaps I should go to {{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing{{color id="-1"}}
and have a chat with Robbie.

---
label: near_0002
---
He didn't just... Did he?

---
label: talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay8}} It looked like you disappeared into
the ring...

But that can't be right. Ah, forget I said
anything. I must have imagined it.

---
label: talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh? {{delay8}}It almost looked like...like you just
disappeared into the ring...

No, of course not. That's impossible.{{delay8}}
Isn't it?

---
label: 0001
---
What about this image?

---
label: 0002
---
You're seeing things.

---
label: talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Of course. How silly of me.{{delay8}} Ha...{{delay8}}ha...

---
label: talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Finding out that the Princess Zelda I met
with was a pawn of the Demon King...{{delay8}}
How to put this to words...{{delay15}}
Let's just say it's thrown me off my
balance. It's so hard to believe.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}And yet, I do believe you, Master Link.
I could not bring myself to doubt you for
even a moment.
And if these ruins pose some kind of a
threat to the Demon King...

then we must accelerate our research at
all costs!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}However, looking inside the ruins without
damaging them is a difficult hurdle, one
well beyond my understanding.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Please, Master Link. Lend your wisdom
to Mr. Tauro. With your help, I'm certain
a way forward will be revealed.

---
label: talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Um, Master Link? Did I see you go inside
of the floating Ring Ruin?

I just...{{delay8}} N-no! Never mind! It's nothing!{{delay8}}
My eyes are clearly playing tricks on me.

---
label: talk_0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}What are you doing?

---
label: talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}You again?

---
label: talk_0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Under Princess Zelda's orders, everyone
is strictly forbidden from getting close to
that ring.
If that applies to an archaeologist like me,
it certainly applies to an amateur like you.

---
label: 0018
---
The princess's orders?

---
label: 0019
---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Princess Zelda visited Kakariko Village
recently. Her orders were clear—of all the
Ring Ruins, this site is off-limits.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}She left before giving any sort of
reason why...{{delay8}}

Maybe she wanted to keep the villagers
safe. Ruins aren't known for being
structurally sound, after all.

---
label: talk_0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}{{size value="80"}}I would brave some crumbling architecture if it
gave us more research material, but it's not worth
disobeying the princess.{{size value="100"}}
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}What if she stripped my title? I worked my whole life
for some recognition, and I won't give it up now!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Yes? What is it?


I'm busy, but I suppose I can indulge in a
moment of idle chatter.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I certainly won't have time for it once I've
uncovered the secret of the Ring Ruins.

I'll be the most in-demand scholar in the
world. Imagine it...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}From Hebra to Lanayru, adoring fans will
call my name. "Doctor Calip!" Can you
hear them? A chorus of scholars!{{delay8}}
Doctor Calip, master of the past.
Renowned genius, Doctor Calip!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}...{{delay8}}Ahem.
