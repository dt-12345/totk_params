Let me go!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}I'm working as fast as I can! Please, just
give me a little more time!{{pageBreak}}...Wait. You're not one of them.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You chased off the Yiga Clan? You mean...
I can get out of here?{{size value="125"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}HURRAH!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}Those Yiga guys were forcing me to make
weird outfits for them. It was awful!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Why me? {{delay8}}Your guess is as good as mine!{{pageBreak}}Maybe because of my reputation for
flashy fashion. I only let Cece-brand
threads touch this body.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hm... {{delay8}}I don't want this mask I made to fall into
their hands, but I can't bring it with me.{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Say, would you want to take this?

label: Talk_0004

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Wait just a minute! Your pouch! It's full!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'll stash this away so no one finds it.
Make some room and come back, OK?

label: Talk_0003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}That thing is decidedly NOT my style,
but if it's yours, more power to you.{{pageBreak}}I'm actually dressed like this so that
I can confess my feelings to the woman
who stole my heart.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Her name is Nobo. She's beautiful, with a
fashion sense that rivals my own.{{pageBreak}}She's probably at a stable somewhere...{{delay15}}
I think. Maybe.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}At any rate, we're meant to be, so I know
that fate will guide me toward her.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Take care now. I hope you find someone
to love too!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Phew! {{delay8}}Thanks for handling that!

---
label: SavedLv1_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you!{{delay15}} That was close. If I lost my
life before I could tell my Nobo I love
her...why, I'd simply die!

label: SavedLv2_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Whoa, that was close!{{delay8}} If I fell in battle,
it would break Nobo's heart!

label: SavedLv2_01

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Once again you save my hide.{{delay8}} Amazing!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL"}}Wow, that was amazing!{{delay8}} You're so strong!

label: SavedLv3_01

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I knew it...{{delay8}} As long as you have love in
your heart, nothing can hurt you!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}Whew... {{delay8}}That was dangerous.{{delay15}} Good thing
I survived, for my sake and Nobo's...

label: Failed01

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}No. {{delay8}}No!{{delay15}} My Cece-brand clothes got dirty!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}I...{{delay8}} I can't be done in here!{{delay15}} Not until I've
told my Nobo how I really feel!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Nope, nope, nope.{{delay15}} Don't you come talk to
me looking like that. I can't be seen with
someone who cares so little for clothing.
I'm not saying you have to dress fancy,
but at least put on a shirt or some
trousers, you know?
