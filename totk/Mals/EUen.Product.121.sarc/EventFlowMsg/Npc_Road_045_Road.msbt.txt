{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey, you're {{delay8}}the guy from that time with
the All-Clucking Cucco! {{delay15}}Thanks for getting
all that sorted out.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Since then, I've been traveling all over,
trying to get strong enough to decide my
own path through life.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Maybe running into each other is a sign
I'm doing things right!{{delay8}} I'm going to be just
as strong as you someday, I swear it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh...{{delay8}} You're the guy from that time with
the All-Clucking Cucco. Glad to see you
looking well.
I'm here in Hebra to get stronger.
Training in cold weather is the best way
to bulk up my muscles—{{delay8}}and my spirit!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Fighting monsters takes strength and
skill, yes, but also {{color id="0"}}knowledge{{color id="-1"}}. That's why
I read the {{color id="0"}}newspaper {{color id="-1"}}every day.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You never know. {{delay8}}A trivial-seeming scrap
of information might just be what saves
your skin!

label: StartPoint_01_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Fighting isn't just about physical strength
and skill. It's also about {{color id="0"}}knowing more{{color id="-1"}}
than your opponent.
That's why I read the {{color id="0"}}newspaper{{color id="-1"}}. You
never know what you might need to
know someday.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I heard there's a big picture drawn on the
ground up {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}. A {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}}—{{delay8}}that's what
they call it.
But you know what else they've got up
north? No roads and a huge {{color id="0"}}monster{{color id="-1"}}
with {{color id="0"}}three heads{{color id="-1"}}!
So I'm conflicted. If that thing found me,
I'm not sure how long I'd last.

But you know what else they've got up
in those snowfields? No roads and no
places to hide!
Plus, I hear there's a huge {{color id="0"}}monster {{color id="-1"}}with
{{color id="0"}}three heads{{color id="-1"}}... {{delay15}}Yeesh!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll go someday, but I think I better bulk
up a little first.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's essential that you're prepared to
encounter a monster at any time.{{pageBreak}}You can do that by staying well-rested,
staying {{color id="0"}}stocked-up on food{{color id="-1"}}, and making
sure your {{color id="0"}}weapons are combat-ready{{color id="-1"}}.
These little preparations can make all the
difference when you're in harm's way.

---
label: RestPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I consider rest to be a key part of combat.
I mean it!{{pageBreak}}It's a chance to think about the battle
ahead. How strong are your enemies?
What terrain will you be fighting on?
Most importantly, {{color id="0"}}what food will you bring{{color id="-1"}}
and {{color id="0"}}how will you prepare your weapons{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}If you don't rest, you'll never get to ask
yourself these essential questions!

---
label: GoRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh yeah, I've got some info to share!{{pageBreak}}Have you seen those monsters with one
large eye? They'll {{color id="0"}}chase after any enemy
they catch sight of{{color id="-1"}}.
If only we could use their {{color id="0"}}eyeballs as
weapons{{color id="-1"}}. Seems like the other eyeballs
I plucked from enemies are good for that.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}They say that monsters with one large eye
will {{color id="0"}}chase down any enemy they catch in
their sights{{color id="-1"}}.
One day, I'll be strong enough to try {{color id="0"}}using
one of those big eyes as a weapon{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: GoRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know, some {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}just set up a
{{color id="0"}}large base {{color id="-1"}}nearby.{{pageBreak}}Ever since I heard about that, I've been
dreaming about going in there and taking
'em all out!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But if I tried that today, I think I'd be
dead before I reached the entrance.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, I gotta train up and learn combat
strategies, like how to assess enemies'
moves and time my attacks!
When I'm done with all that, I'll be those
monsters' worst nightmare!

---
label: GoRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Good fighting's all about strategy. You
gotta watch your opponents' moves, and
time your attacks!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}At least, that's what I've heard...
I'm not even strong enough to take
a Bokoblin.
Let alone all the monsters in that
stronghold near here...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But! No point getting down in the dumps
about it. I've got training to do!

---
label: BackRange_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be careful exploring the caves around
here. Sometimes they have monsters
camped out inside.
I learned that the hard way. Once I
walked into a cave, only to be greeted
by a full-blown Bokoblin ambush.{{pageBreak}}Not recommended!

---
label: BackRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Be careful. There's a cave nearby that's
absolutely packed with monsters.

---
label: BackRange_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Watch out for {{color id="0"}}snowballs {{color id="-1"}}out here. Deadly!
I'm not kidding!

You get hit by one rolling down a hill?
Lights out!

A {{color id="0"}}monster {{color id="-1"}}flying overhead {{color id="0"}}pelts you
with one{{color id="-1"}}? Sweet dreams, sword boy!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Or, in the fleeting chance you survive...{{delay8}}
you'll be too embarrassed to tell anyone
what happened.

---
label: BackRange_02_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}A stationary snowball, that's one thing.
But a {{color id="0"}}snowball {{color id="-1"}}with momentum? Deadly!

If you're not careful, a {{color id="0"}}flying monster{{color id="-1"}}
might {{color id="0"}}rain one down {{color id="-1"}}on you before you
can dodge out of the way.
So be vigilant, OK? Eyes up!
