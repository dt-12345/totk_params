{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I have a bad feeling about this thing.
I don't know why, but I do...

label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Is this...pulsing?{{delay15}} How could that be?

label: near0000

Go away!

label: talk0001

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I've had a nagging feeling ever since
I laid eyes on that strange rock. Like
something bad was going to happen.
But I never would have expected this!

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Part of my job as a guard was to keep an
eye on that strange rock, but...I never
expected it to be a Gibdo hive!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}And then, when I stabbed it as hard as
I possibly could...

{{size value="80"}}Could that be why the Gibdos woke up? N-no,
there's no way.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Even though there was no way to know it
was a Gibdo hive... Stabbing it recklessly
was a terrible idea in retrospect.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}That's got to be why the Gibdos woke up. {{delay15}}But maybe
not... {{delay15}}I hope not...{{size value="100"}}

label: Talk_02

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, so we meet again!


...

label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}You don't remember me, do you?!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Just kidding. Well, a little. We DID fight
for our lives together in Kara Kara Bazaar.
I'd be a bit sad if you didn't remember...
Speaking of remembering, I never got a
chance to express my gratitude for your
help back then. Sarqso.
Oh, I guess I should get used to speaking
your language while I'm out here, huh?{{delay15}}
Ahem. Thank you.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}What do you think? My pronunciation was
spot on, wasn't it? {{delay15}}I hope so—I learned
the phrase and practiced all the way here!

label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I'd heard that Hylians tended to avoid
the rain, but I guess that's not true for
you, huh?
I don't mind getting rained on either, but
a lightning storm... Best not to get caught
in that.

---
label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If someone had told me years ago that I'd
stand guard alongside Hylians, I'd have
laughed in their face.{{delay15}} But here I am...

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'd always thought of Hylians as small,
calm people. Now I've learned that you
are also loyal, skilled weapon crafters!
{{anim type="Greeting"}}Those traits are admirable to any soldier.


You know, as long as I'm here...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Maybe after we find Princess Zelda, I
should try to find my special voe...

---
label: BlackZelda_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, whoops.{{delay8}} I'm keeping you, aren't I?


You're here because you heard the rumor,
right?{{delay15}} Get going, then.

---
label: BlackZelda_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}From here, I can just make out the pattern
on Hyrule Castle's flags, but that's it...

Maybe I should've spent some time
training my eyesight rather than focusing
solely on spear practice...

---
label: BlackZelda_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I heard there was no sign of Princess
Zelda within Hyrule Castle...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}We can't give up though. She must be
out there somewhere.

---
label: BlackZelda_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Don't worry. I'll keep this area safe while
you continue the search.

I believe in you! Give it everything
you've got!

---
label: BlackZelda_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh. I'd heard that most Hylians prefer
to avoid the rain, but not you, it seems.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Oh, I understand. This is how committed
you are to finding Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration"}}Admirable. {{delay8}}But watch out for lightning.{{delay8}}
Finding the princess is important, but you
need to take care of yourself too.
