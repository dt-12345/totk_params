{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, been a while!{{delay8}} You helped track down
my friends in Gerudo Canyon, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We went our separate ways after that.


I was walking around, feeling lonely,
when I heard this pretty melody and just
had to stop and listen.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Funny running into you here. I didn't peg
you for a music lover!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This music brings back memories of the
journey that brought me here.

I was so hopeless after my friends got
lost in Gerudo Canyon.

But they got out safe in the end.{{delay8}}
All thanks to you, of course!

see my friends' faces again.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I wonder how they're doing...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah! Now's my chance! I can listen to
the music from up close!
