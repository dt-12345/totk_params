{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, that explains that! And...{{delay15}}sorry

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}OK, mister voe—if you don't mind, would
you consider helping me with my
spa-plan practice?
I call it practice, but I can guarantee that
it will make your body feel good as new.
Don't worry about that!
But—and this is what I'm still working
on—if I get things just right...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}you'll feel a boost of energy {{color id="0"}}just like{{color id="-1"}} with

The apprentice spa plan is only {{color id="0"}}25 rupees{{color id="-1"}}
too! That's {{color id="0"}}half{{color id="-1"}} what the owner's plan
costs, you know!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hee-hee! Just kidding! It's absolutely
adorable when you panic!

You know, we don't get many...any...
voe customers.

Would you consider helping me with my
spa-plan practice?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You came back!


We don't ever get any voe customers,
so of course I remember you!

How about it? Will you {{color id="0"}}help me out {{color id="-1"}}with
my spa-plan practice?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I have a better chance of getting it right
using these beds than with the ones in
the shelter.

Help you practice?

No, thanks.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Oh... Looks like you don't have enough
money. Don't get me wrong, it's nice
that you're up for helping me practice...
But it still costs me a little to get all
the oils and such. I can't really lower
the price.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso! How long would you like

Until morning.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}OK... I've got to put all of my focus—all

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}I've mostly worked on vai, so let me know

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Good practice for me! A good deal on

Always glad to practice more, so you're
welcome back anytime!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}H-how...was that?{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, you might not be fully relaxed, but
you seem to be less tired, at least.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Clearly I still have a lot of practice ahead
of me, so come back anytime!

label: talk0008

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'm really only an apprentice, so there's
a lot left to learn.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Oh,{{delay8}} but even so, I can guarantee that
it will make your body feel good as new.
Don't worry about that!
