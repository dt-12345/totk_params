Legend has it that the Zonai hid a
treasure in this cave long ago. The
clue is as follows.
"Throw the Zonai spear with a wing
from the pedestal, through the ring.{{pageBreak}}"Should your aim be true and right,
you'll be blessed with dispelling light."{{pageBreak}}I have thrown the spear countless times
in pursuit of this legend, but never once
managed to get it through the ring.
My spirits blunted, I have given up. I leave
a record of this clue in the hopes that
whoever tries next will have better luck.
