{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}You a nomad?{{delay8}} S'pose you've already
seen the horses round the Faron
Grasslands, then?
Well, I grew up taming those horses,{{delay8}} and
I've polished my ridin' skills till they shine.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}In fact, I'm sure there's nobody better'n
me. {{delay8}}But these days, putting my ridin'
skills to the test isn't enough.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So, being the horse enthusiast I am,
I've come up with a contest guaranteed
to push me even farther.

---
label: Talk_10_00_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}And what is this contest exactly?!{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Why, it's a race to see how fast you can
gallop around the course...{{delay8}}without losing
the cargo off the horse's trailer!

---
label: Talk_10_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In fact, if you fancy yourself skilled in the
horsemanship department, why not take a
run at my record?

---
label: Talk_11_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey, it's you.{{delay8}} Ya came back.

---
label: Talk_11_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hey now, we meet again.{{delay8}} Maybe you've
seen the horses that live around the
Faron Grasslands?

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}In this new test of horsemanship skills I've
come up with, riders gotta pull a trailer
while competing for the fastest time.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Whaddaya say? {{delay15}}You got the grit to step
up and challenge the master?

---
label: 0001
---
Let's do it.

---
label: 0002
---
How does it work?

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The challenge here is to go as fast as
you can without letting the cargo fall off
the trailer.{{delay8}}
The course takes you one lap around the
Faron Grasslands.{{delay8}} And don't go trying to
enjoy the sights!
You gotta get through the {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="MiniGame_HorseRace_NumofCheckpoint" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="checkpoint" arg2="checkpoints" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}
and across the finish line as fast as
you can.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Do well, and there'll be some Pony Points
in it for you.

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}How about it? You think you got what
it takes?

---
label: 0003
---
I'll pass.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny_00"}}I thought you had harder bark on you
than that.{{delay8}} Well, you ever change your
mind, come back and see me.

---
label: Talk_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Well shoot, fella. You can't enter a horse
race without a horse to ride!

Go mount up, and come back to me when
you're serious.

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Ah... {{delay8}}Brought that horse here so you
could take part in a certain race, did you?

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've got a towing harness as well.
All right, looks like we're all set to go!

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Just double-checking...{{delay8}} You do want to
challenge my record, don't you?

---
label: Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}That horse you're riding,{{delay8}} it isn't properly
{{color id="0"}}registered{{color id="-1"}} yet.

Go take care of the paperwork at the
stable counter before you try to beat
my best time.

---
label: Talk_60
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}See here...{{delay15}} This is a HORSE race.{{pageBreak}}If you want in, you gotta be on a horse.
Not...whatever this ride of yours is.

---
label: Talk_65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkDeny"}}Huh?{{delay8}} Hold on a sec...{{delay15}} It looks like
you can't use a towing harness with
that horse.
Sorry, but I can't let you run this race
like that. You best come back on a
different horse, you hear?

---
label: Talk_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oops, sorry fella...{{delay8}} You gotta equip a
{{color id="0"}}towing harness{{color id="-1"}} to take part in this race.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You can get a towing harness at the
stable. So save up your points, trade 'em
in, and then see about challenging me.

---
label: Talk_70
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Great! There's just the little matter of
the entry fee.{{delay8}} That'll be {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_71
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}You don't have the dough to race.{{delay15}}
Come back when you've got {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 0004
---
Here you go.

---
label: Talk_72
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}All righty then, let's get ready!

---
label: Talk_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}First, we connect your horse to the trailer
like...{{delay15}}this.

Next, we take a wooden box...{{delay8}}and put it
on the cart...{{delay15}} Alley-oop!

There we go.{{delay15}} Everything's sorted.

---
label: Talk_74
---
Hoo-hee, I can't believe you're gonna give
it a run in your skivvies! Can't wait to see
the results!

---
label: Talk_80
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Now then, time for me to do
some explainin'.

---
label: Talk_81
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}See, you gotta do one lap around this
prairie, {{delay8}}and you can't let the cargo fall
off the trailer along the way.

---
label: Talk_82
---
There are {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="MiniGame_HorseRace_NumofCheckpoint" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}checkpoints{{color id="-1"}}, all told.{{delay8}} And
you can't cross the finish line till you've
passed through every one of 'em.

---
label: Talk_83
---
So clear the {{number14 ref="MiniGame_HorseRace_NumofCheckpoint" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} checkpoints and then
hightail it back here.{{delay8}} Simple, right?

---
label: Talk_84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Be warned, if the cargo falls off your
trailer...you fail.{{delay8}} And no getting off your
horse during the race either.

---
label: Talk_86
---
Do well, and there's Pony Points in it for
you.{{delay8}} How many depends on your time.

---
label: Talk_87

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's it for the rules. Now then,{{delay8}} you
ready to give it a go?

I'm ready!

Tell me the rules again.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}To start, try doing a lap in {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="MiniGame_HorseRace_QualifyingTime_Minutes_Mals" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="minute" arg2="minutes" arg3=""}} and

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Want me to give you a rundown of
the rules?

No need.

---
label: Talk_91

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Then let's get started! Giddyap!

---
label: Talk_92
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This contest puts your horsemanship skills
through their paces, see?{{delay15}} If you want a
good time, you can't just tear through it.
Gotta keep tight control of your steed
so you don't drop what's on the cart.

label: Talk_100

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise"}}Something eating you?

label: 0008

I'm dropping out.

---
label: Talk_101

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Once you pay the {{color id="0"}}20 rupee{{color id="-1"}} entry fee,
you're locked in,{{delay15}} so be real sure first.

---
label: 0009
---
No, I'll keep going.

---
label: Talk_102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Then get going!{{delay8}} This is no time to dawdle!

---
label: 0010

I quit.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That so? What a shame. Just let me know
if you want to give it a go another time.

---

Never mind.

---

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Then what're you doing here? You're not
gonna break my record lollygaggin' about
like this!

---

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Where do you think you're goin'? The
race is on!{{delay8}} Get back here!

---
label: Talk_201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You'll never finish the race if you veer off
course!{{delay8}} Just get through the checkpoints
proper-like, and then get back here.

---
label: Talk_300

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Time's up already, fella!{{delay8}} Come on back!

---
label: Talk_301

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Something eating you?{{delay8}} You'll need a full
attitude adjustment to beat me!

---
label: Talk_400
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Looks like you lost all your cargo!{{delay8}} Better
come on back here.

---
label: Talk_401
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}This contest isn't just about the speed of
the horse.{{delay15}} You gotta control the reins so
the cargo doesn't fall off. That's the key!
Focus on speed too much, and your cargo
will be gone before you know it.

---
label: Talk_420
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}You can't finish the race on foot, you
clodhopper!{{delay15}} I'm shuttin' it down.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}What's the big idea? {{delay8}}This horse race
doesn't work if you're not on a horse!{{delay15}}
Stay put till you cross the finish line.

---

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Uh-oh...{{delay8}} Looks like your trailer's come
unhitched!{{delay15}} Come back this way!

---
label: Talk_452
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}To get a trailer unhitched like that...{{delay8}}
You must've been running reckless.

Hate to say it, but you can't carry cargo
like this...so I have to disqualify you.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Next time, make sure you run steady as
can be. Riding reckless won't win ya
any records.

---
label: Talk_450
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Wanna try again?

---
label: Talk_453

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Uh-oh...{{delay8}}looks like your load is damaged!{{delay15}}
Come on back this way.

---
label: Talk_454
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}You went and let your cargo get
damaged?{{delay8}} What's the big idea?

You can't finish this here contest if you
can't keep your cargo in one piece. I've
got no choice but to disqualify you.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, go break that record! Just be sure
to keep your load in good condition, OK?

---
label: Talk_455

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Hey now,{{delay8}} looks like that trailer of yours is
broken!{{delay15}} Better come on back here.

---
label: Talk_456

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}Went and broke your trailer, eh?{{delay8}} How's
that workin' out for ya?

Can't finish this here contest without a
working trailer. Hate to say it, but I've got
to disqualify you.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Next time you try to break the record,
just be sure to keep that thing in one
piece, OK?

---
label: Talk_500
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration"}}You made it!

---

label: Talk_520
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Whoa, now...{{delay8}} That was pretty impressive!{{delay8}}
You're not too far off my own record.

You'll blow clean past it if I'm not careful.

---
label: Talk_522
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That was a real good run!{{delay15}} Looked like the
horse felt good about it too.

---
label: Talk_523
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well done!{{delay8}} That was a pretty good time.{{delay15}}
Way you rode, I know you're gonna get up
to good things on the next run you take.

---
label: Talk_530
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Hmm...is that all you got in ya?{{delay8}} You won't
be unseating my record that way.

Or maybe you just weren't in the mood to
show off your real riding skills...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Either way, if I were you, I'd convince that
horse of yours to pick up the pace. Might
get a better time that way.

---
label: Talk_533
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Of course, ya did break your own record,{{delay8}}
so your skills are improving!

---
label: Talk_534

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And ya also broke your own record.{{delay15}}
So good for you!

---
label: Talk_614
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_01"}}How 'bout that! You got about the same
score as I did!

You and your horse are gonna have to
be of one mind if you're gonna beat
this time!

---
label: Talk_615
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Well now, you didn't beat this horseman
at his own game.

But don't go feeling sore about it.{{delay15}}
You're just green at this, and there's
no shame in that.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Besides, it won't be long before you've
got experience under your belt.{{delay8}} Then
you'll be the one setting records.
