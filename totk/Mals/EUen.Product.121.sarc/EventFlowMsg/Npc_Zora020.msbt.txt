Begone, sludge!

label: talk45

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}Ugh, I have been shuffling all over {{delay8}}
because bits of sludge keep making
their way onto my lovely beds!
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Wait... {{delay8}}Are you here as a customer?{{delay15}}
Even amid the sludge?! 

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Um...{{delay8}} We're open, of course!{{delay8}} And our
beds are perfectly clean!

---
label: talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Ha! Wow!{{delay8}} Hylians must be made of tough
stuff to come here on a day like this!

{{size value="80"}}Does that mean Sasan is tough as well?{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Ah, oops...{{delay8}} I really must return to
my work.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Link!{{delay8}} Welcome.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We have lost many customers because of
the sludge.{{delay8}} It does not bode well for us.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And we are unsure where Sasan has gone
off to. My daughter is quite attached to
him, so we are all worried.
{{size value="80"}}He might be covered in sludge at this very moment...{{delay15}}
I certainly hope that is not the case.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Ah, oops...{{delay8}} I really must return to
my work.

label: talk1003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}To be able to make it to the domain
even amid the phenomena... You are
amazing, Link.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Sasan is also Hylian. He and my daughter
are quite attached, but sadly it seems he
has not been so lucky in making it here.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Poor Finley is very worried. In fact, it is
all she can think about.

{{size value="80"}}I know she is a young adult, but as her father,
I cannot help but worry that she will go running
off in search of him.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}Oh, oops...{{delay8}} I really must return to
my work.

label: talk1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh! Link!{{delay8}} Thank you so much for once
again saving the domain!

As I'm sure you know, Finley was in
pieces worrying about Sasan, who did
not show up here as planned.
However, thanks to the sludge finally
disappearing, Sasan was able to arrive
here safe and sound!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Finley was over the moon to see him.{{delay15}}
The two have a lot of catching up to do
and have gone off somewhere together.
I am just so relieved that she is happy
once more.{{delay15}} As a father, that is practically
on par with the sludge being gone!
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, heh... {{delay8}}Please forgive me if I am
oversharing.{{delay15}} Anyhow, back to work I go.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Now that Sasan has arrived safely,{{delay15}} my
daughter, Finley, is over the moon!

I am just so relieved that she is happy
once more.{{delay15}} As a father, that is practically
on par with the sludge being gone!
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Hm, perhaps I should show Sasan how to climb
waterfalls... He must be able to get here should
trouble ever come to the domain again.{{size value="100"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Oh, oops... {{delay8}}I got a little too distracted
there.{{delay15}} Back to work I go.

instead of cotton.

It is like being embraced by the motherly
ocean.{{delay8}} The water gently enfolds you in
its all-consuming benevolence...
In fact, our establishment was highly
praised by the princess of Hyrule when
she came to visit the domain.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So, would you care to indulge in the
blissful bed,{{delay8}} which, again, Princess Zelda
