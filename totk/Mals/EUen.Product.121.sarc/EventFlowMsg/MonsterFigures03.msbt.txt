If I had a monster picture...

---
label: Talk73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}If you have any {{color id="0"}}monster pictures{{color id="-1"}} on you,
Hudson can use them to make more
{{color id="0"}}sculptures{{color id="-1"}} for me.{{delay15}} So happy I will be!

---
label: Talk68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hayaa-pweee! You'll hear my request?


In that case, a sculpture of a {{color id="0"}}Battle Talus{{color id="-1"}}
is what I desire more than anything.

---
label: Talk76
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You see, a {{color id="0"}}Battle Talus{{color id="-1"}} is a monster, but
it's ALSO a house. Or maybe it's a...fort?
Hmmm, well...
It's certainly a busybody in the truest
sense! That is, it allows its friends to run
about willy-nilly on its laaarge body.

---
label: Talk78
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Wheefoofoo! The {{color id="0"}}Battle Talus{{color id="-1"}} has inspired
you! Of course, I am happy to describe it
to you again and again and again.

---
label: Talk72
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If I had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}} of a Battle
Talus...or of some other monster...I could
make a sculpture.

---
label: Talk61
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A grin is sure to grow between my ears if
you have any {{color id="0"}}monster pictures {{color id="-1"}}Hudson
can use to make {{color id="0"}}sculptures{{color id="-1"}}.

label: 0001

How about this picture?

---
label: 0013
---
Got a monster in mind?

---
label: 0002
---
Never mind.

Goodbye.

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huu...{{delay15}}hayeee!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


Th-this is the wonderful, lovable
{{color id="0"}}Battle Talus{{color id="-1"}} I was hoping for.

---
label: Talk67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}*sigh* I hope I can add a Battle Talus sculpture
to my collection too.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}M-may we borrow this picture?!

---
label: 0003
---
Of course!

---
label: 0004
---
I'll pick a different one.

---
label: 0005
---
Sorry, but no.

---
label: Talk44
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hwoof!{{delay8}} Nonono!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I had that picture, the sculpture would
be son and done. But...I can't force you.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yep. Right. I'll get it built, son and done.

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Used my imagination to fill in the blanks.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha-hiyaay!{{size value="100"}}


I-it's perfect! This monster sculpture
doesn't have a single flaw!

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Just like you asked.

---
label: Talk83
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, it would make a grin grow between
my ears if you could select the perfect
spot on the {{color id="0"}}stage{{color id="-1"}} for this sculpture.

---
label: Talk84
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry, I've got a rule against making
that kind of decision. Too much
responsibility. Not my thing.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Won't someone decorate the stage
for me?

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We went to so many troubles to get the
sculpture made.

All that's left is for it to be{{color id="0"}} placed upon
the stage {{color id="-1"}}so all the eyeballs can see it.

---
label: 0006
---
I found a nice spot for it.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hwaaah?! What did you just say?

---
label: Talk26
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ooh! OOOOOOH!{{size value="100"}}


See how it blends in there with the stage!
Exactly the kind of clever camouflage
you'd expect from a Battle Talus.
Such artistry! It's exactly what I was
hoping for.

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}There's no way anyone would know it's a
monster at first glance.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes! Now let's put it before all the
eyeballs in the village.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!


This is a Battle Talus...a creature sure to
shock you when you first meet it.

But do not fear. Draw near! This is the
only place you can safely admire such
a monster up close. The only place!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Monster? It looks like a pile of rocks!

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
Now, give me your ears! All of them!

Once again, this enchanting monster is a
Battle Talus.

With a body that looks made of rock, it
doesn't mind that other monsters climb
around it and build their nests upon it.
It's a generous monster, you see, 
both in the size of its body and the
size of its heart!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Don't you wish you, too, could live on top
of it? At the very least, I bet you wish
you could give it a hug. I know I do!
Sadly, they aren't known for enjoying
such emotional outpourings...so it's
best if you give them a wide berth.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Aww... I wanted to try to ride on one,
ZIP-ZAH.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
Understand what you fear and you'll
feel great!
For those with an open mind, wonders
always await!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!


Hoohoohee, the stage has gotten so very
busy. And it's all thanks to you!

Please, take this gift as a sign of
my gratitude.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}It's something I made a long time
ago. I recommend using it on your
favorite horse.
Ah, and take this as well...

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}For so long I've dreamed of collecting
these sculptures and showing the world
how wonderful monsters truly are.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And now that dream is coming true...
all because of you! Thank you!
Thank you many times over!

---
label: Talk85
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Oh phooey! Your pouch is full! To the top!


I've got monster extract to give you, but
first you'll have to make room to carry it.

---
label: Talk86
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hooyagee?! {{delay8}}I was going to give you
a thank-you gifty, but that pouch of
yours is full.
Make some room in there and I'll give
you the monster extract that's waiting
for you.
