YunoboCo HQ?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Oh, sorry, sorry. I mistook you for
someone else.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Just earlier, a {{color id="0"}}blond-haired {{color id="-1"}}Hylian like
you headed off towards {{color id="0"}}HQ{{color id="-1"}}.

Now that I think about it, that Hylian was
a {{color id="0"}}woman{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's rare to see a Hylian around here
unless they're part of YunoboCo.

The one who headed to {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo HQ{{color id="-1"}}
earlier was a{{color id="0"}} blond-haired lady{{color id="-1"}}. Sorry for
the mix-up.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was worried that {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain {{color id="-1"}}had

young Gorons are back to work.
Maybe I can take a little break.
