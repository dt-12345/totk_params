What is that?!

label: near0012

A waterfall from the sky?!

That fish!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Wow! I was wondering who that might
be, and it turns out to be none other
than Link!

label: talk0019_01

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Wow, it's Link! {{delay15}}It's so good of you to
come visit Lady Mipha.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Look... {{delay8}}Do you see how much Ploymus
Mountain has changed?{{delay8}} It now enshrines
a glorious statue of Mipha.
She looks after the Zora from here.
Just like she always did...

The reason we can endure this sludge is
because of everyone's efforts {{delay8}}and also
thanks to her kind protection.

---
label: talk0044

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Mipha is always protecting the Zora.


We must work hard to honor her legacy by
overcoming this troublesome sludge.

label: talk0043

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}By the way, there are some fish I've never
seen before swimming at the base of
this statue.
Just now, I could have sworn I heard
something plop into the water.

Whatever it was, I wonder if it was hoping
to get closer to Mipha.

label: talk0045

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I thought I heard something plop into the
water, and then I saw some fish swimming
there that I've never seen before.{{delay15}}
I wonder if they are hoping to get closer
to Mipha.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Over there...{{delay8}} What is that?!


Something resembling a {{color id="0"}}pillar of light{{color id="-1"}} has
appeared at {{color id="0"}}East Reservoir Lake{{color id="-1"}}! I wonder
if this, too, is related to the Upheaval.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}I can hardly believe it!{{delay8}} A {{color id="0"}}massive waterfall{{color id="-1"}}
came down from the sky?!{{delay8}} Everything is
topsy-turvy ever since the Upheaval!
Princess Mipha...{{delay8}} Please protect your

The water!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Well, now! Is that not you, Link?!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Let me guess... Have you also come here
in search of a lovely new diving spot?

If so, I have some heartbreaking news to
share.{{delay8}} This will be tough to bear, but I ask
that you stay strong.
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_01"}}There is...{{delay15}}no water here!{{delay8}} NONE!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{size value="100"}}I had hoped to break new ground by
diving amid these solemn ruins. I was
positively brimming with excitement!
Alas, my joy was short lived. {{delay8}}When I
arrived, the water suddenly retreated
until I could see the ground beneath!
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_00"}}A diver without water...is like a bird
without sky.{{delay8}} It is a sad state of affairs,
I assure you.{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0053
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Link!


I find myself reluctant to leave this spot,
but in truth, the water is still nowhere to
be seen.

---
label: talk0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired"}}Argh. {{delay8}}I am battling terrible bitterness over
this.{{delay8}} The water has retreated so much you
can see the ground beneath. How pitiful!

---
label: talk0054_01
---
When I arrived, I heard a thunderous roar.
It was as though the ground itself was
crumbling. Then the water retreated.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}As these ruins are quite old, I have
wondered if perhaps a gaping hole
has opened up somewhere.
If only there was still precious water
here, it would have been a glorious
diving spot. Alas...

---
label: near0013_01
---
A gaping hole!

---
label: talk0054_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link!

---
label: talk0054_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}My word!{{delay15}} You really found a gaping hole
in the dried-up ruins?!

And also a wide space at the bottom
of the hole housing those incredible
greaves?!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Now that all is said and done...it is clear
that my instincts were spot on! I knew this
was destined to be an ideal diving spot!
Let us now break new diving ground,
fellow diving fiend. Off we go, into that
gaping hole of promised diving glory!
Link...Hero of the Dive. {{delay15}}Thank you for
sharing this important update with me!

---
label: talk0054_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah, Link!{{delay15}} About that gaping hole you
found...{{delay8}} It is a truly fantastic diving spot!

---
label: talk0054_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}To think that my precious diving water
was draining out through a gaping hole.

I knew without doubt that this would be
an ideal diving spot. My instincts have yet
to lead me astray!

---
label: near0014
---
On to the next dive...

---
label: talk0055
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ah! {{delay8}}Link!{{delay15}} I have not set eyes on you
since we met beneath the whirlpool.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Who could have guessed that a gaping
hole in these solemn ruins would drain
out all of the precious water.
I have just returned after enjoying a lovely
dive into said gaping hole. It was all that
I hoped it would be!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Leaving such an ideal spot is regretful,
but I have little choice...{{delay8}} I must chase the
next perfect dive! Such is my destiny!

---
label: talk0056
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}A whirlpool that previously did not exist.{{delay8}}
Such an exciting diving spot is a rare
gift indeed!
If I do not dive there, who will?! It is my
DUTY to take the plunge!

{{anim type="Work_01"}}I was determined to do just that. {{delay8}}I took a
deep breath, kicked off the ground in a
single bound, and dove in, full of grace!
Instead of my perfect dive...I was greeted
with these solemn ruins within.

I was so profoundly moved by the promise
of such a breathtaking new diving spot.

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="WorkHeavy_01"}}But alas!{{delay8}} There was no water!{{delay8}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As masterful as I am, I still cannot dive
where there is no water.{{delay8}} Sadly, I must
find some other spot to dive.

---
label: talk0057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Link! I am on the hunt for the next perfect
diving spot!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}My eye has been caught...by that massive
waterfall that begins waaay up in the sky!

If I dive in from there, I am certain I will
find ultimate peace and clarity as I fall!

---
label: talk0058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}That massive waterfall that begins waaay
up in the sky... It is my destiny!

If I dive in from there, I will see my true
colors shine brighter than ever upon the
water's surface as I gracefully fall!
