{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I'm glad to see you made it to
Outskirt Stable!

These horses are quite the charmers, eh?{{delay8}}
They used to be stabled southwest of
here in {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Canyon{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But when the {{color id="0"}}weather changed{{color id="-1"}} after the
Upheaval, it took that stable by surprise.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}The horses couldn't handle the {{color id="0"}}extreme
temperatures{{color id="-1"}}, so I took them in.

I just guard the horses. If you want to

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}If you take the road north, there's a place

they appear there {{color id="0"}}night after night{{color id="-1"}}.
Are they spirits of dead horses that can't

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Ah, I'm sorry. I lose my head as soon as

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Thank you, traveler. I can scarcely believe

You know, if I thought this beauty was

it myself.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But it seems like it has friends {{color id="0"}}somewhere

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Say, have you ever tamed any {{color id="0"}}other

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}When I was young, I tried to tame {{color id="0"}}forest
animals{{color id="-1"}} like bears and deer, but I was
thrown off. Sent flying, in fact.
I wonder if it's possible to tame {{color id="0"}}anything
besides horses{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Wouldn't that be amazing? If someone
rode up on a {{color id="0"}}creature other than a horse{{color id="-1"}},
then I'd have really seen everything.

Back in my youth, I would go into forests

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}They sent me flying every time.
I tried so hard, it's a miracle I'm here to
talk to you now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I wonder if it's possible to tame {{color id="0"}}anything
