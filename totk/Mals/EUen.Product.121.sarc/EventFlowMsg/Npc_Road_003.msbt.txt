Hey! The Ring Ruins!

Guess I'd better head out.

I should eat first.

I'll go tomorrow.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Need something?{{delay8}} Better make it quick—
I'm supposed to be on my way to the {{color id="0"}}Ring
Ruins {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You need something else?{{delay8}} Like I said,
I should really start heading to the {{color id="0"}}Ring
Ruins {{color id="-1"}}in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I really shouldn't be making conversation.{{delay8}}
I'm supposed to be on my way to the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins in Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
Then again, when the sun goes down,
the monsters come out, so...maybe I'll
wait till morning.

Kakariko Village?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you want to go to Kakariko Village, just
head toward that ring-shaped thing in
the distance.
That's one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}} Lots of folks
have been talking about that spot—in our
research team as well as the public.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you {{color id="0"}}head south {{color id="-1"}}on the road from this
stable, you'll come upon a crossroad that
takes you to the mountains.
Head all the way down that crossroad and
you'll be in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It's a bit easier to find after the {{color id="0"}}Ring
Ruins {{color id="-1"}}fell, since you can use them as
a landmark.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Fair warning—you'll run into some
tourists. They've been flocking to the
ruins lately.

The Ring Ruins?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}You probably know that fallen Zonai ruins
have been found all over the world since
the Upheaval.
Well, the ones at {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} have
been dubbed the "Ring Ruins," owing to
their distinctive {{color id="0"}}circular shapes{{color id="-1"}}.
There's also some stone slabs there with
words like "sage" and "Demon King"
carved in Zonai script.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The leader of our team—the best in the
world at deciphering Zonai script—is
heading up the investigation in person.
It's all very, very exciting. I just wish the
place was a little easier to get to...

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I should get going too. My fellow

I am.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Kakariko Village is hidden away in a
mountain range. Even with a landmark to
go by, I worry I'll get lost.
Maybe I'll run through the directions a
few more times in my head...

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Then again, with the sun up, it'll be easy for

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Then again, with this rain muddying up the road,
I might slip and break my neck, so maybe I'd better

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}Then again, my metal tools might attract lightning.{{delay8}}

label: Talk1008

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Then again, monsters come out in full

at sunup.
