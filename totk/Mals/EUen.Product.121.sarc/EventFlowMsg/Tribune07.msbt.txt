{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've been hearing some interesting chirps
and warbles...

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, you're also a reporter?


I just had a bit of a strange experience
is all.

---
label: Talk1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You see, I was by the debris near the
{{color id="0"}}three-way intersection{{color id="-1"}} up ahead when a
{{color id="0"}}woman {{color id="-1"}}came up to me.
"Please! Please, you have to help {{color id="0"}}her{{color id="-1"}}!


"Her life is in danger! It would only make
it worse to reveal who she is...

"But please, you must save {{color id="0"}}her{{color id="-1"}}!"{{delay15}}
That's what she said to me.

---
label: Talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The woman sounded really desperate, so
I decided to follow her.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't
keep up.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Eventually I lost track of her. {{delay8}}That's all
there is to it.

---
label: Talk1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, partner...


Does something strike you as odd about
this person whose identity can't
be revealed?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And if revealing who she is to strangers
is dangerous... Could she be someone of
great importance?
And if her life is already in danger...


Well, combining these facts makes me
wonder if this isn't actually a particular,
important person who has gone missing.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I can't be sure, of course, but if there's a
slight chance...

There's only one way for us to know for
sure though. We'll have to peck away at
this news and see what the truth is!

---
label: Talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}{{size value="80"}}...Now that I'm thinking about the whole thing again,
why was that woman staring so hard at my hair?{{delay8}}
How strange.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm going to keep asking around and see
what else I can learn from the folks here.

Why don't you head up to that {{color id="0"}}three-way
intersection{{color id="-1"}} and take a look around?

---
label: Talk1044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I have a hunch that the {{color id="0"}}person{{color id="-1"}} that
woman was referring to and the {{color id="0"}}person{{color id="-1"}}
we're looking for are the same.
I can't be sure, of course, but if there's a
slight chance, well...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}On my honor as a reporter, I swear we
will peck away at this and see what the
truth is!

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I couldn't get a read on her at all...
Except that she was definitely giving off
some strange vibes.

---
label: Talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}She came up to me when I was by the
debris near the {{color id="0"}}three-way intersection{{color id="-1"}} up
ahead and said, "You have to help {{color id="0"}}her{{color id="-1"}}!"
Then she said, "Her life is in danger!{{delay8}}
It would only make it worse to reveal who
she is..."

---
label: Talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I tried to follow her to help, but I just
couldn't keep up with her. {{delay15}}I lost track

you please help me!

My poor, regal friend's life is in danger!
I cannot reveal who she is, for that would
only make things worse...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}She's in hiding and unable to move.
My {{color id="0"}}friend{{color id="-1"}} is in such danger...

Please! I cannot help her all by myself!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh, thank you so much!


My friend is in hiding right now. That is
the only way for her to remain undetected
by those with ill intent!

---
label: Talk1028

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We should go to where my friend is... But!{{delay8}}
Be careful not to be seen. We do not want

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}She told me that, so long as the one who
came to her aid was {{color id="0"}}a man with blond

Oh no... I worry that time is short for
my {{color id="0"}}friend{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, it is the blond-haired man! I knew

I shall guide you to where {{color id="0"}}she{{color id="-1"}} is hiding.
Will you follow me?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}She is waiting nearby, around the

you are coming!

for me to test you.

Blond hair, courage to overcome a
challenge. And then another challenge.
And then another!
Oh, and your disgusting, unwavering
commitment to do "good."

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You are Princess Zelda's chosen

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar"}}Hey!{{delay8}} Hey, partner!

---
label: Talk1057
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}So this is where your investigation took
you. Looks like you really got yourself out
on a limb there!
I've been scouting from the skies, trying
to get to the bottom of this story. I heard
that woman was luring people away...
I thought I heard her voice, so I swooped
on down. And, hey, here you are!

---
label: Talk1054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So tell me...{{delay8}} What have you unearthed?

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}I see... {{delay8}}Who could have guessed that this
whole story would be an elaborate trap
set by the {{color id="0"}}Yiga Clan{{color id="-1"}}...
If you didn't know, they're a group of
assassins trying to bring down the
kingdom of Hyrule.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I heard they were good at disguising
themselves,{{delay8}} but playing the part of a
villager? I never would have guessed.
And all to flush out the swordsman who
protects the princess...

---
label: Talk1060
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What's that?{{delay15}} The woman who was asking
for help was actually a member of the
Yiga Clan?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So she disguised herself as a villager
and was trying to lure the princess's
appointed knight to a trap...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It really is some impressively bad luck
that they keep coming after you instead,
isn't it?

---
label: Talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}They thought you, a young up-and-
coming reporter who just happens
to have blond hair...
They believed you were actually that
swordsman? {{delay15}}That's just bad luck for you!

---
label: Talk1058
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}You've definitely got some skills, though,
if you can escape from the Yiga Clan.{{delay8}}
I'm proud of you, partner.

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'm glad I don't have to write a headline
like, "Junior Reporter Falls to the Cruel
Blade of the Yiga in Pursuit of Truth!"

---
label: Talk1032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, it's time I took off and turned
these unusual details into an article.{{delay15}}
You take care, partner!
