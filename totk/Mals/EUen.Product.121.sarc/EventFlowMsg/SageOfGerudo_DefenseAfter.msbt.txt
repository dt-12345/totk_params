{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link! I am incredibly grateful for your help
in the battle. On behalf of all the Gerudo,
thank you.
I suspect the Gibdo threat will calm down
a bit now that we've wiped out the hives
that were surrounding the town.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I noticed that the hives crumbled into
sand when we destroyed them...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I wonder if the Gibdos have some kind of
connection to the sand?

Or maybe... {{delay8}}Maybe they're connected to
the sand shroud? Did they make it? Did it
summon them?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hmm...{{delay15}}


And then there's the voice that you and I
both heard.

A voice and lightning... This reminds me
of something!

{{anim type="Understand_01"}}Link, there's something you should see.
Come down to the {{color id="0"}}mural in the
underground shelter{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}It is my duty to let you know that the
attire you are wearing is...unacceptable.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Yiga have been our enemies for some
time, and it would be inappropriate to
walk around our town dressed as one.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}It is my duty to let you know that you are
underdressed at the moment.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It would be better if you put on some
more clothing before you head into
the shelter.
