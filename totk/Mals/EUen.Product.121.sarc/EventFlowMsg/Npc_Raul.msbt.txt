{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Nostalgia_01"}}I love this view of the {{color id="0"}}Temple of Time{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
I always took a moment to appreciate it
whenever I passed by here.{{pageBreak}}The {{color id="0"}}Garden of Time{{color id="-1"}} was quiet. The only
sound to be heard was the {{color id="0"}}time bell{{delay8}}{{color id="-1"}}
ringing in mornings and evenings.{{pageBreak}}It was as if the whole place changed at
its chime. {{delay8}}Especially at night, when the
sound signaled the emergence of fireflies.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Those were glorious times.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Nostalgia_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}The {{color id="0"}}time bell{{color id="-1"}} that sounds from the Temple
of Time rings at a set time each morning
and evening.{{pageBreak}}Along with the constructs, {{delay8}}we woke to the
sound of the bell. {{delay8}}When we heard it in the
evening, we knew it was time to rest.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}It also played its part in our traditional
ceremonies. {{delay8}}In a way, it was this place's
beating heart.{{pageBreak}}The sight of the temple and the sound of
its bell stir fond memories in me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I see that they're still at work even now.{{pageBreak}}We originally created the constructs to
assist in our endeavors. {{delay8}}All of us were
fond of them.{{pageBreak}}I never imagined they would continue to
carry out their assigned tasks to this day.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Nostalgia_06"}}The fact that their labor no longer serves
any purpose, yet they perform it still...{{delay15}}it
is disquieting to me.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I am troubled by the sight of the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The {{color id="0"}}Steward Constructs {{color id="-1"}}were the first to
be built. {{delay8}}After that, we crafted others
suited to different roles.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Culinary Constructs, Maker Constructs...{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}}
You'll find all sorts of them still active in
this place.{{pageBreak}}Some became so skilled within their
specialties that they surpassed us.{{delay8}}
We began to learn from them instead.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You should take time out to talk to them.{{delay8}}
They can teach you many things you
might not yet know.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Nostalgia_01"}}{{color id="-1"}}There are many types of constructs to be

protect our land from invaders.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I am terribly sorry for any threat they
pose to you now.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}We find ourselves in a sea of clouds.{{pageBreak}}Interesting. {{delay8}}That would mean we're at

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Nostalgia_06"}}But I remember it being on the surface.{{delay8}}
What has happened in the ages since?
