{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Are you also stuck here thanks to the
{{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}? Ugh, is it ever going to
let up?
I came out here to investigate the ruins
that fell around the Digdogg Bridge...

But this intense daytime heat and the cold
nights have messed with my skin, so I
figured I'd take some time off at the spa.
{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}But thanks to the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, I can't
get to Gerudo Town! This is just...the
worst! Argh!
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hmph. {{delay8}}OK.{{delay8}} I'm fine now. Just need to turn
this frown upside down. No wrinkles, just
have to unfurrow my brow...
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Which I'd do, no sweat, if I could just take
advantage of that {{color id="0"}}spa plan{{color id="-1"}}! Ugh.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Is the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} ever going to
stop? Seriously...

I've been investigating ruins in intense
daytime heat and freezing cold nights,
and it's done a number on my skin.
I took some time off to go visit the spa...

Spa plan?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}There's a skilled aesthetician in Gerudo
Town named Romah.

The fluffy beds here are great and all,
but I hear Romah's spa plan is something
else entirely!
Apparently nothing else can make you feel
as relaxed and refreshed as it does!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Shitauchi"}}I just want to soothe my poor skin and
bone-tired body! Excavating at Digdogg
Bridge has been exhausting! Argh!
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hmph. {{delay8}}OK.{{delay8}} I'm fine now. Just need to turn

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If I read "Three Big Ideas" one more time,
I'm going to start seeing the pages in
my dreams...
Had I known I'd be stuck waiting this
long, I would have at least brought a real
book. Or a newspaper. Or anything else.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Wait...Gerudo Town isn't in danger...right?
What if Romah was attacked by those weird
monsters from before and is hurt?
No, no...even if she were attacked, monsters like
that wouldn't stand a chance against Romah's
special technique...right?{{size value="100"}}
