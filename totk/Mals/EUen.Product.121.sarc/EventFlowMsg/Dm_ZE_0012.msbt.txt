{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Link? You look distracted. What's wrong?

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Goodness! {{delay15}}You say you had a vision?
Saw mysterious figures?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And then Princess Zelda?! {{delay15}}Hmm...


The geoglyphs, the literature, the
Dragon's Tears...and now, a vision
of the lost princess.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}What if these are all connected?


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Let us continue to examine the geoglyphs.
They may contain further clues that lead
to Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}You know, according to the literature,
there is something to do with geoglyphs
in the {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple{{color id="-1"}}.
The {{color id="0"}}Forgotten Temple {{color id="-1"}}lies at the bottom
of a canyon in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}. I think we should
make our way there soon.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}I am also curious about whatever it
was the Light Dragon dropped. {{delay15}}Worth
investigating, I think.
