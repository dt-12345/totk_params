{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's the same Hyrulean script, and yet it's
so different from our modern language...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I still have a lot to learn. {{delay15}}Hm?

{{color id="5"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}{{color id="-1"}}Don't tell me. {{delay15}}Based on your stature,
physique, and distinctive right arm...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}you must be Link. {{delay15}}Am I right? Purah has
told me so much about you.{{pageBreak}}{{color id="5"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}I'm Wortsworth. My research specialty
is ancient Hyrulean.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}And by ancient Hyrulean, I don't mean
the text found in the Ring Ruins, but
something different.{{pageBreak}}It's what we call the language used at the
time of Hyrule's founding. Our modern
language is built on that foundation.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}These books here are written in that
ancient tongue. They'd look like gibberish
to your average Hyrulean.{{pageBreak}}Are you curious about ancient Hyrulean?
I don't have anything to show you as
things stand now.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}But I'm sure I'll someday have results
posted and ready for all to see at the lab
in Kakariko Village.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I've been studying documents containing
ancient Hyrulean, discovered all over and
collected in Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}But the text in these sources only appears
in bits and pieces, so my research is
going very slowly.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}But I'm sure I'll someday have results
posted and ready for all to see at the lab

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Our sources of ancient Hyrulean are few

progress in my studies.{{pageBreak}}I'm sure I'll someday have results posted
and ready for all to see at the lab in
Kakariko Village.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}When I discovered the stone tablet at
Lookout Landing, I could barely believe
my luck.{{pageBreak}}I never dreamed I'd get a glimpse of a

a lot to me, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That's a depiction of the stone tablet
