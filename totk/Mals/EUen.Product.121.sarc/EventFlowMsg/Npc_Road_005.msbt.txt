{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Been a while since I saw another Hylian.
Around here, it's Gorons as far as the
eyes can see.
I'm en route to Goron City. I hear that's
the place to go if you want {{color id="0"}}fire-resistant
clothes{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hopefully they're not too pricey.
