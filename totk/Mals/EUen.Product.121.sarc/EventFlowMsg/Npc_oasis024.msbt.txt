What could I use?

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}{{color id="0"}}Lady Riju's{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}lightning strikes{{color id="-1"}} clearly damaged
those monsters...

I wonder... If I {{color id="0"}}attached{{color id="-1"}} an {{color id="0"}}Electric Lizalfos horn {{color id="-1"}}to
this spear, would that be enough to let me fight back
against them myself?
But Electric Lizalfos horns are valuable... I wonder
if there's some other {{color id="0"}}material{{color id="-1"}} I could {{color id="0"}}attach in
its place{{color id="-1"}}.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}What do you think of this? Pretty great,
am I right?{{delay8}} It was all my idea too!

Who else would think to attach a {{color id="0"}}fire fruit{{color id="-1"}}
to a spear?

Oooh, I can feel my fighting spirit yearning
to be unleashed with this in hand!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Prepare yourselves, monsters!{{delay8}} Tremble in
the face of my blazing fighting spirit!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The battle was fierce, but in the end, we
paid them back for our earlier failures.

Unfortunately, the spear I made—the
one with a fire fruit attached to it—broke
during the fight.
No lives were lost though! A spear is a
small price to pay, all things considered.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}While voe in general are not allowed to
enter the town, you helped us fight off
the recent threat...
Pass through with your head held high!

Hmm? Do you need something else?


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Are you interested in my spear? My
custom-modified spear?

I'm not surprised—isn't it amazing?{{delay8}} All my
idea too!

label: Talk_AfterChallenge_01

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}This is it—my masterpiece. No one else
would think of attaching a mirror to
a spear!
At first glance it may appear to only be a
well-adorned weapon, but think about it
for a moment...
If the sun strikes this weapon on a
cloudless day, the tide of battle will turn
in your favor!
How?{{delay8}} From the sun's reflection blinding
them, of course! They'll stop right in
their tracks, dazzled by the light!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Don't worry. You have my permission to
copy this amazing idea!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, check this out!{{delay8}} Isn't this attachment
something special?

One of the younger guards made it
for me!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Have you ever seen something that
captures a burning passion as well as
this does?
You'd think, living in a desert, I'd get sick
of anything that hints at heat. But you'd
be wrong!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I know, I know. {{delay15}}You're a bit jealous just
looking at it, right?{{delay15}} You can make one
yourself though! I won't stop you!
