{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}It looks like my brother Yolero is slacking

I've definitely gotta find him tomorrow

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I guess my brother Izra isn't coming back
until he finds the farming tools he lent to

And I have to find my brother Yolero...
