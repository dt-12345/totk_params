And now it's raining.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You're a Goron. You should know the way
to {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}.

How in the name of Hylia did you forget?

---
label: Talk4002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Lay off! I'm embarrassed enough as it is!{{pageBreak}}Besides, it's not that I forgot. When I left
the city, there was still lava everywhere.{{pageBreak}}I didn't know {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain {{color id="-1"}}would stop
erupting, the lava would cool, and {{color id="0"}}new
roads {{color id="-1"}}would form!

---
label: Talk4003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You don't have to tell me there was
lava everywhere.{{pageBreak}}It used to be so hot that Hylians couldn't
step foot on the mountain without
fire-resistant gear.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Even if I wanted to take a trip that way,
I couldn't.

---
label: Talk4004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Well, thanks to this guy, now ya can!{{pageBreak}}First, we have to walk down the road
toward {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}, which you can
see over in the northeast.
Then we'll arrive at {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}},
and from there, we keep goin' north.

Thanks again for the directions, fella!

---
label: Talk4011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Happy to be of service.


Using {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}} as a landmark is all
well and good, of course.

But the {{color id="0"}}red haze {{color id="-1"}}around the summit looks
worryingly like gloom.

Try not to get too close.

---
label: Talk4005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right—let's go!{{pageBreak}}And on our way, we'll stop by that bistro
place you keep mentioning.

---
label: Talk4012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right—{{delay8}}let's get going, then! Might as
well get out of this rain.

And on our way, we'll stop by that bistro
place you keep mentioning.

---
label: Talk4006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now you're talking!

---
label: Balloon1001
---
The ruins ain't far now!

---
label: Near_07
---
Ack! I'm soaked!

---
label: Talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You traveling alone?

---
label: Talk1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Are you traveling alone?

---
label: Talk1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We used to be solo travelers too, until
we ran into each other on the road.{{pageBreak}}The big lump's got no sense of direction
at all. Would you believe he forgot the
way to {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}, his hometown?
I couldn't bear to watch him flail around,
so now we're travel buddies.

---
label: Talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}I didn't forget the way! The way changed!
How was I s'posed to know the lava would
cool like that?{{pageBreak}}It used to be scorching hot, crisscrossing
the mountain...

---
label: Talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}You're right. I'm being harsh. The way to
{{color id="0"}}Goron City {{color id="-1"}}is very complicated now.{{pageBreak}}It's not as if you can find it by simply
heading toward {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain {{color id="-1"}}in the
northeast.

---
label: Talk1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That's it! If you keep makin' fun of me,
I won't cook anymore!

---
label: Talk1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Hahaha, all right, you win. I'll stop, since
I can't cook to save my life.{{pageBreak}}That's why we're such good traveling
buddies. We make up for each other's
weaknesses.

---
label: Talk1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry for nattering on. The sight of
you traveling alone just made me a
bit nostalgic.{{pageBreak}}We're thinking of going to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in the Necluda region next. That's in
the east.
This guy's dying to see the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Course I am! The ruins' ring-like shape is
one of a kind!{{pageBreak}}I can't WAIT to taste them! {{delay15}}I...mean chew
them! {{delay15}}I mean...

---
label: Talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise"}}We've talked about this! Priceless ruins
are for seeing, not eating!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyway, {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} is where
we're headed.

---
label: Talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Kakariko Village is right over there next
to that {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}And the ring-shaped rock to the left of it
is probably one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}If you get turned around on the journey,
you can look at those two things to
reorient yourself.

---
label: Talk1009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They're harder to see in the rain. But that
should clear up sooner or later.

---
label: Talk1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The weather's a little overcast right now,
so they're hard to see. But it should clear
up sooner or later.

---
label: Talk1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Then why wait? Let's go!

---
label: Talk1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, big guy.

---
label: Talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}We're off. See you on the road!

---
label: Talk1023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, I recognize you from Lookout
Landing! You traveling alone, brother?

---
label: Talk1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}We met you at Lookout Landing! Good to
see a familiar face.

---
label: Talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We're thinking of going to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in the Necluda region next. That's to
the east.

Nice to take a break.

---
label: Near_08
---
Darn rain. I can hardly see!

---
label: Talk2001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey! You headed to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}too?

---
label: Talk2010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, you're that traveler we saw at the
stable. You going to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}} too?

---
label: Talk2002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Well, you're almost there.

---
label: Talk2005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's on top of that hill.

---
label: Talk2011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}It's on top of that hill. {{delay8}}Hard to see
through the rain, but I promise it's there.

---
label: Talk2006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oof, I'm hungry... You SURE I can't have
a taste of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}? A little nibble?

---
label: Talk2007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}A little nibble of rare, otherworldly ruins?
{{delay8}}I don't think so, Kairo.

---
label: Talk2008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Bwahaha! I'm just joking!

---
label: Talk2009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry. Pretend you didn't hear all that.{{pageBreak}}We're well-behaved travelers. We'd never
dream of sullying the places we visit.

---
label: Talk2012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm starving. If I take one more step, I'll
collapse from hunger!

---
label: Talk2013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh_00"}}Yeesh, so dramatic.{{pageBreak}}I guess we'll stop here and have
something to eat.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm starving. If I take one more step, I'll
collapse from hunger!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}Yeesh, so dramatic.

---
label: Talk2016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You go on ahead to {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
We're going to rest here a while.

---
label: Talk2017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And have a meal! I can't travel on an
empty stomach!

---
label: Near_01
---
Maybe we should back off.

---
label: Near_02
---
Come on! Let us in!

---
label: Near_05
---
We'll get in tomorrow, yep!

---
label: Near_03
---
You're not permitted!

---
label: Near_04
---
Gah...

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}I told you! You're not permitted!

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Kairo, she's getting angry. Maybe let's—

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Why? Why won't you let us in?!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}As I have said, males aren't allowed here!
Give up! Go back where you came from!

---
label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}My buddy told me you let him in! How
come he could go in and we can't?

---
label: Talk_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}What? That is a lie! Your voe friend did
NOT get in!{{pageBreak}}There's only one voe with permission to
enter this town.

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}That one. Right there.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Aren't you the traveler we met on the
way to Kakariko Village?

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Runaway"}}What? No fair! I smell favoritism!

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Favoritism? That voe is special!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}You're lucky you are dealing with me and
not Merina over there. She'd have carved
you to pieces by now.

---
label: Talk_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Come ON! Let us in!

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Gerudo Town is a sacred place! I told
you, voe may not enter without express
permission, and that's final!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}All right. We tried. Perhaps it's time to
give up and go somewhere else.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}No way! I'm not givin' up!{{pageBreak}}My friend told me he got in! If we keep
asking, they'll let us in too!

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, it's you.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I've just about had it with Kairo's
stubbornness. Now he's set up a tent
to camp out by the gate.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}By all accounts, the place is off-limits
to males. I doubt they'll decide to bend
the rules for us.
How you got permission to enter, I can
only imagine.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So it's true what folks say—males really
are barred from Gerudo Town.{{pageBreak}}But you've been there, right? I'd love to
hear what it was like sometime.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}My friend told me he got into
Gerudo Town.{{pageBreak}}He said there were lots of heavenly
smells—which means there are tasty
things to eat!
{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You've been there, right? How? What was
your secret?{{pageBreak}}Persistence, right? You didn't give up,
so I won't either!

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}How come you and my friend were
allowed into Gerudo Town?{{pageBreak}}I can't stop wondering what's in there!

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You have permission. Come in.

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Those two are testing my patience.{{delay8}}
I'm so busy with them, I've had no time
to decorate my weapons.
But I'm fine. Who I worry about is Merina.
She can't stand voe, and these ones are
especially annoying.
If she gets any madder, it'll turn into a
scuffle, and I do not want to be around
for that...

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Now those two have set up a tent in front
of the gate. {{delay8}}The audacity!{{pageBreak}}I'm so busy keeping an eye on them that
I have no time to decorate any weapons.{{pageBreak}}But I'm fine. Who I worry about is Merina.
She can't stand voe, and these ones are
especially annoying.
If she gets any madder, it'll turn into a
scuffle, and I do not want to be around
for that...

---
label: Talk_25

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Those two are troublemakers. {{delay8}}I had been
hoping to go off duty for the first time in
ages and decorate my favorite weapon.
