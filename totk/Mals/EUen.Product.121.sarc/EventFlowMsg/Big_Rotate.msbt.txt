Mr. Hero!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}One of my friends told me there's
someone at Lookout Landing who
made a tool that makes pictures.
If you happened to have that thing, I
wouldn't even need to leave to see the
whirly circle.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But, you know that friend of mine? They
told me something else... Something
shocking!
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}They said there's more than just whirly
water circles. There's a {{color id="0"}}big swirly sand
circle{{color id="-1"}} too!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Swirly sand!{{delay15}} Could such a thing
really exist?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}WHOA! Look at that big swirly sand circle!

the center.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wonder what would happen if you got
