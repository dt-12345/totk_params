{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Welcome! You've found your way to
{{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Com_FirstTime_Only01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Now then, since this is your first time with
us at Woodland Stable...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Since this is your first time visiting 
Woodland Stable, and I see you've
also {{color id="0"}}registered a horse {{color id="-1"}}here...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Since this your first time visiting
Woodland Stable, and you also had
yourself a good {{color id="0"}}sleep{{color id="-1"}} here...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}We are the closest stable to {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}},
home to the Gorons, of course.

Death Mountain is done erupting, and the
city and roads are in good condition.

Though, you'll still find hot lava {{color id="0"}}inside the
caves{{color id="-1"}}, so take care not to get {{color id="0"}}burned{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Goodbye_03

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Link, did you already pay the {{color id="0"}}hot spring{{color id="-1"}}
a visit? Just a dip and your fatigue
will melt away, I swear.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Once upon a time, a hot spring sprang
from the {{color id="0"}}well {{color id="-1"}}here too.

label: DoNotWakka_01

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Sir! Sir! That bit of decoration is a
beloved fixture here at the stable.
You must not remove it!
It was made in a place far to the south of
here called {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

It's said that the shape of the {{color id="0"}}ring garland{{color id="-1"}}
brings good luck. We have it on display
because it's our lucky charm.

label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Sir! Please! I'm telling you that's the
stable's good-luck charm! You simply
can't take it!
If you find it so desirable, go get
one yourself!

They sell them far off to the south in a
place called {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.

label: BurnedWakka_01

{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_01"}}Look here, if you're so interested in that,
how about you go get one for yourself.

You'll find they sell them in a place called
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village {{color id="-1"}}far off to the south.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}It's a big picture frame, eh?{{delay15}} Now all
I need is the perfect painting to put
inside it.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}There are these famous hot springs near
Goron City {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}} of here. {{delay8}}So maybe a
painting of the springs would be nice?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But I don't know...{{delay8}}a picture of hot water?{{delay8}}
That wouldn't be very interesting to look
at, would it?
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}What I'd really like to do is hang a{{color id="0"}} picture
of a Goron soaking in hot springs{{color id="-1"}}. Now
THAT would be compelling.{{color id="0"}}
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}But when will I have time to head over
there and then paint up a picture? Never!
That's when. 
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}What I need is a picture of some sort—one
that captures the scenery. {{delay15}}I could use it
for reference and paint up a copy, easy.

label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}Pardon?!{{delay8}} You...have a {{color id="0"}}picture of a
Goron soaking in hot springs{{color id="-1"}}?

label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}There are these famous hot springs near
Goron City to the {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}. I'd love to hang a
painting of them on the wall here.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In fact, I understand Gorons love to spend
their time relaxing in the hot water there.

So what I'd really like to do is paint
a {{color id="0"}}picture of a Goron soaking in the
hot springs{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Ah, but I can't just up and leave this
place. And if I can't look at the scenery
for inspiration...how can I paint it?

label: Com_Photo_09

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}What I'd like to do is hang up a {{color id="0"}}painting
of a Goron soaking in hot springs{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}It would be good advertising for the
hot springs, and would go perfectly on
the walls here since we're so close.

label: 9001

I have a picture.

---
label: 9002

All the best with that.

I changed my mind.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_01"}}What?!{{delay8}} You have a {{color id="0"}}picture of a
Goron soaking in hot springs{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If only I had a picture like that in front of
me.{{delay8}} I could paint a copy of it, easy as
can be.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}If you happen to have a {{color id="0"}}picture of a
Goron soaking in hot springs {{color id="-1"}}I do hope
you'll show it to me.

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Now, this is certainly a feast for the eyes.


But if you ever want to see a different
{{color id="0"}}painting of a Goron soaking in the hot
springs{{color id="-1"}} on the wall, just let me know.
Just show me the picture you have in
mind. I'll paint a copy and put it on
display for all to see.

label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}I have to say,{{delay8}} that hot spring looks like it
feels wonderful. Makes me think I should
ditch my post and go for a soak!
Heh, who am I kidding.{{delay8}} It's back to work
for me.

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Thanks to you, Link, I've got a painting
on the wall and a stable with a bit more
personality.
Those hot springs look so soothing,
I swear I feel the stress float away
every time I glance at that picture.

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} would you like to do something
with the {{color id="0"}}painting of the soaking Goron{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Ahhh, what a splendid painting. Just
looking at it makes me feel like I'm the
one relaxing in a hot spring.

Let's change it.
