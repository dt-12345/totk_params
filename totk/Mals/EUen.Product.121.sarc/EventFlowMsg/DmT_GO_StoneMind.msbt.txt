Yunobo, little rock...

label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_001_b
---
I've heard that voice...

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_002_b
---
Are you the one who's been talking to us this whole
time, goro?

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_003_c
---
Yes. I am your ancestor from a time long past.

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_004_b

I served the first king of Hyrule as a mighty warrior
and as a sage who, like you, could command fire.

label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_005_b

You fight using your body as a weapon... Impressive!
You ARE my descendant—the pride of the Gorons.

You defeated that monster—the source of those foul
rocks. But it was the Demon King who summoned it.

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_007_b
---
He sent that monster to keep you from obtaining the
stone you just found—my secret stone.

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_008_b
---
Secret stone? Demon King?

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_009_b
---
Hah, so this is the first you've heard of any of this...

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_010_c
---
Then listen carefully to what I have to say.

---
label: DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_012_b

Let me tell you about the Imprisoning War and the
duty of our people.
