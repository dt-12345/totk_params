{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}What are we going to do with that boy?{{pageBreak}}It's just like him to fly off on his own and
leave all the food we collected behind.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I'll be! What is a Hylian doing all the
way up here in such a fierce blizzard?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}You're here to talk to Tulin, eh? {{delay8}}You just
missed him, unfortunately.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Our task was to scavenge food in this
area, but we just saw a flock of monsters
fly past outside the cave.{{pageBreak}}The same ones that have been sighted
around the village lately, in fact.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I told the others we should return right
away to report them, but Tulin clearly
wasn't listening at all.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}He said, "I'm gonna follow them back to
their nest," and flew off alone before I
could protest.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If you leave the cave and head north, you
can spot a {{color id="0"}}lone cedar tree{{color id="-1"}} on Talonto
Peak. That's where we saw the monsters.{{pageBreak}}No doubt Tulin followed them there.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}I know he thinks he's unbeatable, but he
really shouldn't be taking these chances.
