{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I got to a good stopping point with
my work, so I plopped down here in
the springs to restore myself.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}{{1:1 arg="0x0000003F"}}Whoo-whee.{{delay8}} {{1:1 arg="0x0000803F"}}I had heard plenty of good
things about Goron Hot Springs, but
there's no denying it's the best.
My stiff, achy muscles are getting all
loose and floppy thanks to the magic of
these waters.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If you can't tell, I just love this place.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}As you might have guessed, all the
springs around here in Eldin are
piping hot.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Recently Death Mountain calmed down,
so the waters have cooled to a
temperature Hylians can enjoy.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Even with the waters being as perfect as
they are, some folks have a rough time
climbing up to Goron Hot Springs.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}So there's always the springs located
in front of Bedrock Bistro. Those
ones are relatively easier to get to.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}Oh yeah, Elmerson said he'd be going to
that restaurant...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}It'd be a real shame to make your way
to Death Mountain and not hit Goron
Hot Springs.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Indeed. The secret springs in Hebra
up in the northwest are your best bet
for something hot in someplace cold.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There are three secret springs in the
Hebra Mountains, but it's absolutely
frigid there.
You'd be risking your life if you
tried going.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}As a hot-springs fanatic, I'd love to go...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}But I've tried three times now and had
to give up due to inclement weather.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You know, I've also heard that on clear
nights, there's an extremely rare aurora
phenomenon that sets the sky alight.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Can you imagine... Soaking in a luxurious
hot spring while gazing at a sparkling sky.{{delay8}}
That's the stuff of dreams, my friend.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Well now. {{delay8}}There are quite a few
springs to choose from. Ultimately,
it's a cost-benefit analysis.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}How quickly and easily can you achieve
contentment? {{delay8}}That's what you've got to
consider here.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}By that measure, the Meda Mountain
secret springs would be my top
recommendation.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There's a place called Hateno Village to
the south. Meda Mountain is on the road
leading there.
Nothing more than a little detour to find
it. The scenery's a beaut, and the springs
themselves? Perfection.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}It's my happy place, so do me a favor and
keep it secret from the rest of the world,
will ya?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hey, stop adding outside water!{{pageBreak}}It's not the temperature that matters at
a hot spring. It's the water quality!{{pageBreak}}So please don't dilute it with...wherever
that came from.
