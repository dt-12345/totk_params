{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}All right...{{delay8}} Mind going through it all one
more time, just to make sure I have all
the details correct?
What happened that night when the
{{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} hid herself away?

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Well, {{delay8}}we had our accident here one awful
night, some time after the Upheaval.

We saw the Great Fairy nearby...{{delay8}}vanish
from view. It was troubling somehow.
We got in our wagon to go to her.
That's when it happened...

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Frightful, the whole thing!


That's when the{{color id="0"}} woman with blond hair{{color id="-1"}}
jumped out in front of us.

Our {{color id="0"}}horse{{color id="-1"}} bolted away—off it ran, into
the night.

{{anim type="Sad_00"}}But the real tragedy! That involved
one of the most crucial members of
our troupe...

---
label: Talk_0043
---
Our beloved {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}!


Some of its {{color id="0"}}wheels{{color id="-1"}} broke, and now we
can't even transport our instruments to
performances! Or us!

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}At least no one was hurt.


But since that night, the Great Fairy has
been hiding in her {{color id="0"}}bud{{color id="-1"}}. She seems afraid
of something.

---
label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}It was that woman, I tell you! She did
something to the Great Fairy!

She's a villain twice over! She left the
scene of our tragic accident without so
much as an apology.

---
label: Talk_0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Whatever reasons the Great Fairy has
for hiding herself away, we thought a
{{color id="0"}}performance {{color id="-1"}}would cheer her up.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But with {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}} broken down, we
can't transport our small troupe or
our instruments there.

---
label: Talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And the one who caused all of this...{{delay8}}was
a {{color id="0"}}blond-haired woman{{color id="-1"}}, you say?{{delay8}} Hmm.
Could that have been...

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh! Hello there, partner! I didn't know
you were out this way!

---
label: Talk_0031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Oh! Hello there, partner! I didn't know
you were out this way!

I didn't notice you just now on account
of the rain.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You have perfect timing though. Sorry to
spring this on you so suddenly, but we've
got work to do.
These fine {{color id="0"}}musicians{{color id="-1"}} here were just
telling me an interesting tale.

Apparently, the Great Fairy who lives near
this stable has shut herself away in her
flower bud.
Why, you ask? Well, it seems to have
something to do with a mysterious
{{color id="0"}}blond-haired woman{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}My reporter instincts are calling out!
Could the mystery woman be her?

{{size value="80"}}Could she be {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}?{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Of course, we can't put anything to print
until we're sure it's true, so we have to
talk to the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}, first.

---
label: 0004
---
Great Fairy?

---
label: Talk_0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Ha! Asking all the right questions. Good
instincts, kid. You'll make a decent
reporter yet.

---
label: 0005
---
OK!

---
label: Talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hold on! You have to learn to flap before
you can soar, after all. Let's give you
the rundown on the Great Fairy first.

---
label: Talk_0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My vision isn't that great when
it's raining...

---
label: Talk_0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Look way up those hills. See that big
plant in the distance, the one that's
spouting that pretty stuff?
That right there is the flower bud where
the Great Fairy lives.

They say she really likes this {{color id="0"}}musical
troupe{{color id="-1"}}, and that's why she moved near
the stable recently.
A Great Fairy who loves this troupe's
{{color id="0"}}music performances{{color id="-1"}}?{{delay8}} That alone is
something worth looking into.

---
label: Talk_0029
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We mustn't forget that the Great Fairy
bestows {{color id="0"}}protective blessings{{color id="-1"}} on travelers!

Her presence is essential to the stable.{{delay15}}
I do hope we can help her soon.

---
label: Talk_0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If only we had a {{color id="0"}}way to reach her{{color id="-1"}}...


But {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}} is broken, and we don't go
anywhere without it. Not to mention, our
{{color id="0"}}horse{{color id="-1"}} is gone. We're stuck here.

---
label: Talk_0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What are you thinking, partner? The
members of the troupe mentioned a 
woman with blond hair...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}I think it might be Princess Zelda!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We should check in with the Great Fairy
and find out what she saw, but if she
won't show herself, hm...
Maybe we can get her to come out if we
bring the musicians to her somehow?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Their {{color id="0"}}wagon{{color id="-1"}} is busted though. What do
we do...

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Breezer {{color id="-1"}}is broken, and we don't go
anywhere without it. And of course, our
{{color id="0"}}horse {{color id="-1"}}ran off too.

---
label: Talk_0124
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'll try to think of a {{color id="0"}}way to reach the
Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} You're taking the troupe members
up to the Great Fairy, partner? That's
impressive.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I suspect that the blond-haired woman
the troupe members saw might be
Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But we can't just write that in the paper
without any proof.

---
label: Talk_0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is inside that flower bud
just up the road.

If she comes out, make sure to get the
whole story from her!

---
label: Talk_0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But first, you'll need to get the {{color id="0"}}troupe
members{{color id="-1"}} up to the {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} safely.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Y-you want us to get out?!

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Huh? No way...

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The Great Fairy's presence is essential to
the stable.{{delay15}} I wish we could {{color id="0"}}perform{{color id="-1"}} for
her. I think she'd feel better then!

---
label: Talk_0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}If only our music could reach the Great
Fairy from here. But it can't.

---
label: Talk_0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And we can't go anywhere if our {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}
won't budge.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Is there trouble?! I do hate trouble!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But as soon as it's safe, we must press
on! Fetch us from the stable when we
can continue.

---
label: Talk_0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I can't believe it!

---
label: Talk_0037
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Violynne! He's made some sort of
change to {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}.

We may be able to be on our way now.
Quick, let's get in. We wouldn't want to
be left behind!

---
label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}The {{color id="0"}}Great Fairy{{color id="-1"}} is just up the mountain.
She lives inside a {{color id="0"}}flower bud{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}My first ride in a while. Feels new.
Away we go!

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Our {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}} takes us and our instruments
from place to place...

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But some {{color id="0"}}wheels {{color id="-1"}}came off and broke in
our accident.

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}And it isn't going anywhere without
a {{color id="0"}}horse{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Runaway"}}Aaah! We're falling! Nooo!

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Runaway"}}Aaah! We're drowning! Nooo!

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}That was close. A little too close,
I must say.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I suppose we'd better try again.

---
label: Talk_0049
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}What are you doing?


Please don't do anything strange like
that to our dear {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I think you're going in the wrong
direction. We need to go to the
Great Fairy.

---
label: Talk_0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If you're not going to head for the Great
Fairy, then I'm sorry to say that we'll
be returning to the stable.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Wh...{{anim type="Notice"}}what's this? We can't get into
{{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}} if something's where we sit!

---
label: Talk_0054
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Wh...{{anim type="Notice"}}what's this?


We couldn't possibly get into {{color id="0"}}Breezer{{color id="-1"}}
while it's in such a state!

---

I'll take you.

Let's start over.

...

---
label: 0003

Where's the Great Fairy?

---
label: Talk_0100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Should we tell the newspaper...{{delay8}}what
happened here?

---
label: Talk_0101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Absolutely. We'll tell this whole awful
story to the {{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}} and no
one else. They'll take it seriously!

---
label: Talk_0102
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I don't know how we'll get word of this
to them though...

The {{color id="0"}}Lucky Clover Gazette{{color id="-1"}} is in the Hebra
region. They're working out of a stable,
I heard. That's all so far west though...

---
label: Talk_2000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you. We can take it from here!


All right, Mastro, lead us into the
performance...

---
label: CarryNpc_Vio_Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Our little troupe must play with all the
heart we can—for the Great Fairy!

---
label: Talk_3000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Behold, Violynne! The Great Fairy graces
us with her presence!

---
label: Talk_3001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Truly divine...

---
label: Talk_5001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well, look at this! You really helped out
here, partner.

---
label: Talk_5002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I flew here as fast as I could when I saw
the bud opening up.

---
label: Talk_5003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So this is...a Great Fairy.

---
label: Talk_3009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ahhh...{{delay8}} I couldn't resist coming out to
bask in your beautiful music.

Now that I'm outside, I see that the
world is not at all how Princess Zelda
described it to me.
She warned me that an awful gloom was
spreading over the land, and that the
world would soon be lost to monsters.
I hid myself away.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But now that I look back on it, while
Princess Zelda was speaking to me, I had
the feeling something wasn't right.
In the deep dark of that night, I couldn't
see her face clearly. Maybe it was
{{color id="0"}}someone else{{color id="-1"}} entirely...

---
label: Talk_4003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}So, she looked like Princess Zelda...{{delay8}}but
wasn't Princess Zelda.{{delay8}} I don't like the
sound of that at all.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I think our reporting work might be
taking a darker turn here.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}On the bright side, the Great Fairy is out
of hiding, and that's a big scoop!

I've got to take wing and get this news
written up for the newspaper!

---
label: Talk_4004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}OK, I'm going to take this story and
head back! This article will keep readers

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Mastro...{{delay8}} I thought...{{delay15}}the rest of our
musicians left the troupe because they
didn't like how I played my violin.

---
label: Talk_3003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Violynne! That wasn't it at all!


Why, you moved the heart of the Great
Fairy herself with your violin. Your playing
is impeccable.

---
label: Talk_3004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I guess...{{delay8}}I really did do that, didn't I?


I've heard the {{color id="0"}}other Great Fairies {{color id="-1"}}also
are hiding away in their buds...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I bet if you—I mean, we—play music for
them, that'd cheer them up too!

---
label: Talk_3005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}A brilliant idea! And you know what that
calls for? Reuniting our troupe...

{{size value="125"}}The Stable Trotters!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_3006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thank you for helping us get here.
It means a lot to me.

We're a troupe of two for now. But, oh,
you just wait! I just know we'll get the
other musicians back with us somehow!

---
label: Talk_3008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Now that that's decided, we should get
ready for our journey, Violynne!

Let's hurry to the other {{color id="0"}}Great Fairies
and bring them out of hiding{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I was about to return to my spring and its

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been worried about our safety, but
