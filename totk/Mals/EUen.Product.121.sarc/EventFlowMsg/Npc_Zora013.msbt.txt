{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionSurprise_00"}}Hm?!{{delay8}} Have you suffered damage from the
sludge, friend?!{{delay8}} Are your gills well?!

I am in the midst of a battle, so I cannot
accompany you, but please pay a visit to
the infirmary if need be!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}With this mop as my weapon, {{delay8}}I must
resume the fight! {{delay15}}It is me against this
dreaded muck!
In other words... I must keep this place
clean, otherwise it will hinder our ability
to bring in more patients.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hm?{{delay8}} Ah. Upon closer inspection, it's you. A Hylian.
Without a gill to your name!{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}When sludge gets in a Zora's gills, their
health fails fast.

That is why the infirmary has been set
up—to give victims of that gunk a safe
place to rest.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}It is also why I must continue fighting this
accursed sludge, day in and day out.
The domain must be kept clean!

be found at {{color id="0"}}Mipha Court{{color id="-1"}}.

And that place can be found at Ploymus

I've considered not telling others about it.
Although...I suppose I just did. Hm.

Shooed away...

label: talk1131

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Well, then. When I was cleaning the
throne room, the children shooed
me away.
They declared that they were playing a
secret game and insisted, vehemently,
that adults are "not allowed."
I did hear something interesting about
their little game though...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}They're allegedly pretending to be
{{color id="0"}}King Dorephan{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay8}} What's more, it seems
they're recreating {{color id="0"}}recent events{{color id="-1"}}.
It is ill-advised to allow them to mess
around over there. As an adult, I must
participate! I mean, watch over them!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}The question is, how do I sneak a
peek?{{delay8}} I wonder if there's somewhere
I could hide...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Could it be{{delay8}} that you somehow managed to

about King Dorephan?
Please, tell me! What did they say?!


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Ah... I have gotten carried away.{{delay8}} I'll just

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I am terribly fascinated by how the young
ones are pretending to be King Dorephan.

I was just pondering if there's some way
I could sneak closer to overhear their
chatter!
Please, tell me! What are they saying?


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Ah... I have gotten carried away.{{delay8}} I'll just

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}In the end I was unable to glimpse the

It is a shame, but I really must return to
my duty.

label: talk1125

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}My duty is to repair the domain, but I
have not touched the tools necessary
for that in days.
The building damage concerns me greatly,
true, but my most important task at
present is to fight the sludge's mess!
I am...{{delay8}}quite motivated.

---
label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Now I will resume my thorough

my cleaning wrath!

label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I am speaking of the filthy sludge and the
sullied water that it has melted into.

The sludge started falling on the day of
the Upheaval.

When the sludge touches the water,
that sweet, life-giving liquid becomes
instantly sullied.
I am sure this fact is blatantly obvious
when strolling the domain, {{delay8}}but the water
that is that awful color is the dirty water.
{{anim type="Ease_00"}}As Zora, our existence is irrevocably
entwined with the water. It's our lifeblood.
We cannot live without clean water.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If I leave any trace of sludge, it will dirty
the water that Prince Sidon has so

That stone was absolutely ideal for

I intend to try my best at making it look
