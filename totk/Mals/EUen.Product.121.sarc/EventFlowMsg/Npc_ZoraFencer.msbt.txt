{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Link!{{delay8}} Thank you ever so much for saving
the domain!

As it were, there is something that I would
like to speak with you about, if you have a
moment to spare.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It is about an item of yours that you
entrusted the domain with repairing—
your {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}!
The repair is mostly complete, but it does
require just one more thing...

I need a fish called an {{color id="0"}}ancient arowana{{color id="-1"}}.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I can finish the armor right away if I can
somehow acquire a scale from that fish.

We have not seen {{color id="0"}}ancient arowanas{{color id="-1"}}
around lately, {{delay8}}and I have no idea where
they can be found.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If you locate one, Sir Link, please bring it
to me.

Do so, and I shall fix your precious item
at once and return it to your care!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}As you well know, the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor {{color id="-1"}}allows
even a Hylian like you to climb waterfalls
with ease.
I am certain that such a skill will aid you
on your journey, so please do not forget!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Sir Link! {{delay8}}Thank you ever so much for
saving the domain. You are everything
that Sidon claimed you to be.
Though this is hardly sufficient remittance
for the debt we owe, know that your {{color id="0"}}Zora
armor {{color id="-1"}}is nearly repaired.
As you well know, the Zora armor allows
even a Hylian like you to {{color id="0"}}climb waterfalls{{color id="-1"}}
with ease.
I am certain that such a skill will prove
useful to you, Sir Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The only trouble is that I cannot find an
{{color id="0"}}ancient arowana{{color id="-1"}}, the last thing I need to
finish the repair. I am at a standstill.
We have not seen them here recently, and
I have no idea where they can be found.

I must find a way to acquire an {{color id="0"}}ancient
arowana {{color id="-1"}}as soon as possible...{{delay8}}

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}However, in order to finish the repair,

Oh, {{color id="0"}}ancient arowana{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}} Where in the world
are you?

Oh, that reminds me. I can finally give you
your precious {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}, which is once
again as good as new.

{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}Please, take this.


{{anim type="Ease_01"}}I am so happy that I was able to repair it
for you. It is a precious piece of armor,
after all.
As you well know, that Zora armor allows
you to climb waterfalls with the ease of
us Zora.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I hope that this will aid in you your
search for Princess Zelda!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}I finally had the opportunity to have a
meaningful conversation with my
dear Sidon.
Ever since the sludge started falling,
we simply could not manage the time
for it, as much we both needed it.
Once all of these strange phenomena are
taken care of, {{delay15}}he and I will be able to have
many more important conversations.
{{resetAnim arg="[13,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I am certain that his sweet sister, Mipha,
is looking down on us, through our
struggles as well as our triumphs.

{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}From here on out, I shall make it a point
to always keep the lines of communication
open with my dear Sidon.
It is my duty as a queen and as his
adoring wife!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I thought I was prepared to become a
queen, but now that it is actually coming
to pass...I am in disbelief.
At the very least, I must strive very hard
to ensure that I do not embarrass myself!

{{anim type="Chat_00"}}To start, I shall prepare my dear Sidon's
throne. I hear the Exalted Dorephan will
be returning to his palace as well.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}In time, and little by little, I will perhaps
become used to this new position of mine.{{delay8}}
I already have much to do!
I intend to prepare Sidon's throne for him.{{delay15}}
Ah, and I must make arrangements for
the Exalted Dorephan's new abode.
