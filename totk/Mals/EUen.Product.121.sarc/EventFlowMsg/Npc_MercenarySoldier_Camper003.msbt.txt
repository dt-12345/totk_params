A dish worthy of the elite...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Are you...a traveler? {{delay8}}Lured here by the
aroma of my cooking, I imagine.

label: Talk_0002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This camp belongs to {{color id="0"}}Captain Toren's
squad of the monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}They
are executing a major strike as we speak.
I recommend you clear the area before
things get hectic.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} that serves as the monsters'
base is {{color id="0"}}up the hill and down the road{{color id="-1"}},
but even here we might be in danger.
Captain Toren is on his way there now
to clear those monsters out.

label: Talk_0004

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}As the squad's chef, I stayed behind.{{delay8}}
I may not swing a sword, but my ladle
prepares meals worthy of this elite team.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}If you followed your nose here, you must
be hungry. {{delay8}}Take this. It's one of my
personal specialties.

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Hm? {{delay15}}Your pouch is almost spilling over
with food. Oh well. I suppose you'll have
to wait to try my cooking.

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The members of Captain Toren's squad
are skilled, but they get hungry quickly.{{pageBreak}}I'm worried that their hunger may
distract them, allowing a monster to
catch them unawares.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}How I wish they had {{color id="0"}}someone to aid them{{color id="-1"}}
should their appetites waylay them...

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Oho, there you are again! {{delay15}}The day has
hardly dawned, and yet the smell of my
cooking is impossible to resist.

---
label: Talk_0010_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Hello again! {{delay15}}Lured back by a craving for
my cuisine, I presume?

---
label: Talk_0010_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Welcome back! {{delay15}}It's only natural you would
dream of my cooking as night falls.

---
label: Talk_0010_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Ah, there you are! {{delay15}}Proof that my cooking
can draw a hungry audience even in the
foulest weather.

---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Captain Toren's squad of the monster-
control crew {{color id="-1"}}is executing a strike ahead.{{delay8}}
Careful you're not caught up in it.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sometimes monsters can get the better of
even the most elite fighters. {{delay8}}I hope our
squad is safely able to claim victory...

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It was your appetite that brought you
here, yes? {{delay8}}Have some of this. It's one
of my specialties.

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}The captain left that weapon here {{delay8}}so that
I might defend myself when left to guard
the camp.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But so long as I live, this chef's only
weapon will be this ladle! {{delay8}}You're welcome
to use that blade as you see fit though.

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Did you...{{delay8}}come here knowing that this
is the camp for {{color id="0"}}Captain Toren's squad of
the monster-control crew{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Captain Toren's squad is now leading a
dangerous and important strike. Mind that
your curiosity doesn't get you involved.

---
label: Talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}{{color id="0"}}Akkala Span{{color id="-1"}} is down the road from here.
The squad's mission is to strike at the
monsters that have taken it over.

---
label: Talk_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Of the three monster-control-crew
squads, Captain Toren's is the cream of
the crop.
I consider myself fortunate to serve them
meals befitting their premier status.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Your growling stomach led you to me, did
it not? {{delay8}}I'm happy to share my cooking
with you, if you'd like.

---
label: Talk_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's the duty of an elite squad to confront
powerful foes, and I know they're up to
the task.{{delay8}}
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}But this fight comes right on the heels
of the one in Eldin, so I worry they might
be exhausted.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I would feel a lot better if they had a
{{color id="0"}}skilled ally{{color id="-1"}} to assist them.

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Captain Toren's squad of the monster-
control crew{{color id="-1"}} is mobilizing nearby. {{delay8}}Tread
carelessly and you may get involved.

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I've heard they're dealing with some
troublesome foes. I can only pray they'll
be all right.

---
label: Talk_1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}The squad members left that weapon
behind for my self-defense.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But I've never wielded anything heftier
than a ladle! {{delay8}}I'd be grateful if you could
put it to good use.
