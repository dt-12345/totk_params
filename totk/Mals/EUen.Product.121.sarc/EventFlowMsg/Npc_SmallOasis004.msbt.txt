{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq_00"}}Vasaaq!{{delay8}} This desert is a dangerous place.
My products make it less so!

---
label: GreetingAfter03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq_00"}}Vasaaq!


Now that the sand shroud has lifted, the
weather's perfect for some exploring! How
about something to keep yourself safe?

---
label: near1002
---
{{anim type="Happy"}}Need some travel security?

---
label: near1003
---
We're sold out! Thank you!

---
label: talk1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq_00"}}Vasaaq! A journey through the desert is
dangerous, and a fully stocked pouch is
the best defense!
By the way, the counter in the back is the
{{color id="0"}}front desk for the inn{{color id="-1"}}—just in case you
want to rest up before your travels.

---
label: talk1017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I was really surprised when all of those
strange monsters swarmed the oasis...

But thanks to the effort and guidance
of the guards, my shop and everyone in it
made it through without a scratch.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I hear you were a big help too!


You must be tired. The {{color id="0"}}front desk for the
inn{{color id="-1"}} is in the back, so you should go and
rest. You've earned it!

---
label: talk1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="CustomVasaaq_00"}}Vasaaq! The sand shroud might be gone,
but that doesn't mean the monsters are.

The first step of any journey is ample
preparation, so buy until you drop!

If you need to recover from your shopping
spree, the {{color id="0"}}front desk for the inn{{color id="-1"}} is
conveniently located at that back counter.

---
label: talk1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Journeying through the desert is rough!
If you don't prepare right, you could try a
hundred times and never make it through.
The counter in the back is the {{color id="0"}}front desk
for the inn{{color id="-1"}}, so you can rest up before your
travels, if you like.

---
label: talk1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I like the way you shop! I can't say
sarqso enough.

I'll be closing up shop until my next
shipment of stock arrives.

But the {{color id="0"}}front desk for the inn{{color id="-1"}} will still
be open, so feel free to stay with us
if you like.

---
label: 0012
---
Buy my stuff!

---
label: talk1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oooh! You have something to sell me?

---
label: 0013
---
Wait, where's the inn?

---
label: talk1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Sorry, it's pretty far back there, so it's
kind of hard to see.

---
label: talk1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}The counter back there is the front desk.


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Oh dear... She's back to her book again.

---
label: talk1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm very sorry.


I've told her a million times not to read
when we have customers.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Before we switched jobs, I used to have
her working this general store, but, well...

She's a little...hm. How do I put this?{{delay15}}
Quiet?{{delay15}} Unsociable?

Customers are rare enough as it is.
We don't need her attitude driving
them away.

---
label: talk1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I personally think customers should be
welcomed with a smile when they walk in,
so I'm filling the role of greeter now.

---
label: talk1025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}That said, I hear we have a customer
who's come back to stay at the inn
multiple times.
I think she might be drawing in customers
simply by being herself. Maybe that's
charming in its own way.

label: 0014

So long.

---
label: talk1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}This oasis is safe because of the guards,
but be careful if you leave it, OK?

---
label: talk1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Oh dear, I shouldn't have said that...{{delay8}}
Anyway, is there anything else you need?

---
label: Com_Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What would you like to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}How does{{color id="0"}} {{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} sound?

label: Com_Talk_02

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso!

label: Com_Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh dear...you changed your mind?

label: Com_Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Take your time.

---
label: Com_Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}How many would you like to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}OK, so {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them? That'll come to
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}! Sound good?

---
label: Com_Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh, er... We don't deal in that here.

---
label: Com_Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}If you want to sell that, I'm afraid you'll
have to take it off first.

---
label: Com_Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}How many do you want?

---
label: Com_Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Just one will come to {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}},
all right?

---
label: Com_Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}All of them will be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Com_Talk_35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}All {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them... That'll come to a total
of {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}! Sounds good, right?

---
label: Com_Talk_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}! Sound
all right?

---
label: Com_Talk_52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}So, {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} of them will be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Com_Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh dear...you changed your mind?

---
label: Com_Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Looks like you don't have enough rupees.
Why not sell something you don't need?

---
label: Com_Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Looks like your inventory is full... Why not
sell something you don't need?

---
label: Com_Talk_56

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Just one will be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso! Want to sell something else?

---
label: Com_Talk_02c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso! Anything else to show me?

---
label: Com_Talk_02d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso! Anything else?

---
label: Com_Talk_05b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Still have things to sell?

---
label: Com_Talk_05c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Always gotta keep your pouch organized.

---
label: Com_Talk_05d
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Anything else?

---
label: 5500
---
Yes.

---
label: 5501
---
No.

---
label: 5502

I'll take it.

---
label: 5503

Never mind.

---
label: 5507

I'll take 'em all!

All of them.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso!

label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso for your business! Why not stop by
the inn while you're here?

---
label: Talk_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Sarqso for your business! I hope to see
you back once I've restocked!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What are you trying to pull?! Get out of

We never turn folks away!
