{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Managing food reserves and supplies,
granting audiences and such...this village-
elder gig just isn't sitting right with me.{{pageBreak}}Life was so much easier when all I had to
do was hunt. Just me and my bow...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But you didn't come to hear me complain.{{delay8}}
What can I help you with?

label: NpcTalk_002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello, Link. Is there something you need
help with?

---
label: NpcTalk_003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Anything else you want help with?

label: NpcTalk_004

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If there's anything I can answer for
you, ask.

label: NpcTalk_005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Is there anything else you want to know?

---
label: NpcTalk_006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I've told you what I know. Unless you
wanted to hear it again?

The Stormwind Ark?

Anyone seen Zelda?

Nothing.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's the name of a ship that features in
an old Rito children's song.{{pageBreak}}As the song goes, long ago when a
disaster threatened our village, a god
sent us a {{color id="0"}}great flying ship{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The blessed winds created by the ship
put everything right.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Doesn't sound like something that really
happened, huh? But this never-ending
blizzard counts as a disaster to me.{{pageBreak}}I'd take anything if it would save us from
this. Even a children's story.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}I guess the truth is somewhere up there
past that ominous cloud...

label: NpcTalk_009

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Haven't heard anything myself. Did you
try asking Harth?{{pageBreak}}He has good sources. If anyone has a lead
on Princess Zelda, it would be him.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You'll find Harth in the {{color id="0"}}lodge to the north{{color id="-1"}}.
If you get lost, use the {{color id="0"}}pair of bonfires{{color id="-1"}}
they keep burning as a landmark.

---
label: NpcTalk_011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, then. If you decide to visit Harth,
take care of yourself.{{pageBreak}}The closer you get to that cloud, the
{{color id="0"}}colder it'll get{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}You'll need to take extra
precautions against the blizzard.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Once again, we owe you so much. Not
only did you save the village, you helped
set Tulin straight.{{pageBreak}}The Rito will never forget this debt.
It is now our turn to aid you.{{pageBreak}}You can leave the Hebra Mountains to us.
We'll scour them and find you your lead
on Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Our hearts are always with you, Link.
Remember that. And don't be a stranger.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}We will repay the debt we owe to you.
When we turn up a lead on Princess
Zelda, you'll be the first to know.

a mountain of things I need to see to.{{pageBreak}}I'm on my way home to think about our
next steps.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I've got a long way before I can live up to
Kaneli when it comes to being elder.

You don't have the bow?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Why don't you have the Great Eagle Bow?
Did it break or something?{{pageBreak}}Well, if you collect some materials and
bring them here, I can remake it for you.{{pageBreak}}I'll need five bundles of wood, three
diamonds, and a swallow bow.{{pageBreak}}I can't help you without all of those
things, so be sure to bring back enough.

Remake it, please!

Never mind.

Problem with the bow?

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That Great Eagle Bow is nice, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I made it, but my work has the seal
of approval from Harth, the Rito's
greatest craftsman.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Take good care of it, and it'll take care of
you in return.

label: Talk0017

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Oh? I don't see the Great Eagle Bow on
you anywhere. Did you decide not to
take it with you?{{pageBreak}}I'll remind you that bow is a masterpiece
which has the seal of approval from
Harth, the Rito's greatest craftsman.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}So try not to lose it, will you?{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}None of us had any time for leisure while
the blizzard was still a problem.{{pageBreak}}But now that it's behind us, I can take the
time to tinker with my newly crafted bow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}It's nice knowing my son is using the
same bow that I do.
