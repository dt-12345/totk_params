{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Welcome.{{delay8}} You have tread upon the land
of a sacred shrine. I am the keeper of
said shrine.

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}My task is to guide visitors here to the
sacred shrine by conveying this message:

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}"Dye the white pattern black when the
sun awakens in the sky. Then will the
sacred shrine appear."{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The shrine will appear when you unlock
the true meaning of these words.

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Oh. You discovered the shrine already?
Before I imparted my words of guidance?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Well. That makes me feel rather
superfluous.{{pageBreak}}I should have spoken up sooner.
Apologies.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This shrine is mine to oversee whether in
the sky or on the surface. As is the land
where it resides.

My task is complete.

---
label: talk0005

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}The task I was given is complete thanks
to you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Now I will watch over the sacred shrine.

label: talk0006

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Welcome back to the land of the sacred
shrine.{{delay8}} I am glad to have you here again.

label: talk0007

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}My task is complete thanks to you.


Now I will watch over the sacred shrine.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Your skill is impressive.{{delay8}} Have you
considered taking part in the
{{color id="0"}}dive ceremony{{color id="-1"}}?
You should participate if you have not
done so.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}The dive ceremony is a test of bravery
that young Zonai must pass in order to be
considered adults.
You can earn a {{color id="0"}}special outfit {{color id="-1"}}as proof of
your maturity by clearing the trial.

But this island is not where it takes place.

---
label: talk0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The dive ceremony is held on three
sky islands.

One {{color id="0"}}north of Central Hyrule Sky{{color id="-1"}}...


another {{color id="0"}}west of Central Hyrule Sky{{color id="-1"}}...


and a third {{color id="0"}}south of Lanayru Sky{{color id="-1"}}.


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}I have no doubt you will be able to pass
the trials on all three islands and thereby
obtain the outfit.
Please do so when you have time.

label: talk0010

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Oh... You have already gone to all three
sky islands and completed the ceremony?

I should have guessed as much...{{delay8}}
Your talent is plain as day.
