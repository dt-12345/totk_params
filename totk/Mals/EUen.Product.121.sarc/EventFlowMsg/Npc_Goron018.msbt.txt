{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'm Ramella. I'm a jeweler from Gerudo
Town in southwestern Hyrule.

The {{color id="0"}}ore {{color id="-1"}}that {{color id="0"}}YunoboCo {{color id="-1"}}handles are
high quality, so I always travel here to
procure them.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But at the moment, there aren't any
available here.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I don't suppose...{{delay15}}you have any amber,
do you?

---
label: Talk_00

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'll buy 10 pieces of {{color id="0"}}amber{{color id="-1"}} for
{{color id="0"}}200 rupees{{color id="-1"}}.

label: 0000

I'll sell.

Nope.

---
label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You won't? Certainly you can sell your
ore at any old shop.

Amber is getting easier to come by, so the
selling price is lower than ever.

I'm the only one who puts such a {{color id="0"}}high
price{{color id="-1"}} on {{color id="0"}}amber {{color id="-1"}}these days.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Sarqso! Oh, {{delay15}}sorry.


"Sarqso" is another expression where I'm

Kids these days shorten it to "sarq."

---
label: Talk_31

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That was very helpful. I'll buy ore from
you anytime.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Though keep in mind that I'm often
looking for different ore at
different times.
So check in with me every so often to see
what I'm looking for.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You know, it seems most everyone's into
that marbled rock roast and not much
else. Not a great time to procure ore.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since you're speaking to me again,{{delay15}}
I assume you have ore to sell me?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that the marbled rock roast is gone,
the Gorons are back to their usual grind.

I finally feel like I can relax and get the
