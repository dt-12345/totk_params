{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}A traveler coming to Goron Hot Springs
at this hour?{{delay15}} You must be some kinda
hot-spring connoisseur or something.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Ah, but I promise ya this—I'll always be
the first one in the water!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Coming to the hot spring at this hour, 
when the sun is beating down...

Ya got to be some kind of hot-spring
connoisseur to do that,{{delay15}} traveler.

label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ya don't often see a Hylian turn up at the
Goron Hot Springs at this hour.

Ya must be quite the hot-spring
connoisseur or somethin',{{delay15}} traveler.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ya don't often see a Hylian turn up at the

I'd wager you're some kind of hot-spring

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Got yourself to Goron Hot Springs at this
early hour, did ya?{{delay15}} Why, you're a real
hot-water buff, aren't ya?
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Well, no matter how big a fan ya are,
no one—and I mean no one—beats me
into the hot springs.

label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You made it to the hot springs at this
hour? With the sun blazin' down like that?

I guess ya really are a hot-water buff after
all,{{delay15}} traveler.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hylians don't turn up at Goron Hot
Springs at this late hour very often.

Well, traveler,{{delay15}} I suppose you're a real
hot-springs buff after all.

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Ya just don't see Hylians show up at
Goron Hot Springs like this.

But you, traveler... {{delay15}}You're quite the
hot-springs buff, aren't ya?

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Sure, sure. There are other hot springs
boiling away in other places, but the hot
water here is the best.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Though it used to be {{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}}
had the best water...before the entrance
collapsed and ya couldn't get in.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}The hot water here at the Goron Hot
Springs is real nice and all...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But talking about {{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}}
makes me want to go there again.

Simmerstone Springs?

label: Talk_04

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Simmerstone Springs is in the {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}
of {{color id="0"}}Gorko Tunnel{{color id="-1"}}, which is southeast of
these springs here.
They're top secret, ya see.{{delay8}} Ya gotta be
a Goron in the know to know about 'em. 

The water at those springs is the perfect
temperature and goes real nice with all
the steam in the caves.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But the entrance got blocked off so...


I can't ask YunoboCo to fix it, and I can't
clear it out myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}But this spring here is my favorite right
now, so I guess I don't need any others.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Well, no matter where it's located,
a hot spring is a hot spring. It all feels
the same.
This one here is pretty nice though. After
all, you can look at the Death Mountain
scenery while ya soak.

label: Talk_17

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}This hot spring does happen to be a good 
one. After all, you can take a soak while
gazing at the Death Mountain scenery.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Up until a little while ago, red smoke and
big ol' clumps of red rocks were flying
right out of it.
I was worried it might erupt again.{{delay8}} But it
seems to have calmed down now.

Talk about a relief.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Hey now... Where's your manners?


Some of us are enjoying the water the
way it is.{{delay15}} If it's too hot, you'd better go
somewhere else.
