{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Huh?


Oh.{{delay15}} You're the voe...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry,{{delay8}} I don't have time to deal with a voe
right now.

All my attention needs to be on preparing
to welcome the {{color id="0"}}out-of-town vai{{color id="-1"}}. The sand
shroud is making things difficult...

Sorry, I still don't have time to deal with
you right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry, I don't have time to deal with you
right now.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I need to hurry and prepare to welcome
the {{color id="0"}}out-of-town vai{{color id="-1"}}.

The sand shroud is a real pain though...

Out-of-town vai?

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I suppose I can tell you. After all, your
situation is unique.

As it happens, young Gerudo aren't
traditionally allowed to interact with voe.

And for vai born outside town, when they
reach a certain age, they're summoned
back to Gerudo Town.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}That small vai over there is named {{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}.


She recently arrived here along with her
mother, {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But Perda started working at one of the
{{color id="0"}}shops{{color id="-1"}}... One that has a...{{color id="0"}}complicated
relationship{{color id="-1"}} with the town.
So she is rarely in the {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}} anymore.


{{anim type="Tired_01"}}That must be why Aaqlet spends so much
time looking at that {{color id="0"}}drawing on the wall{{color id="-1"}}
over there.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Thankfully, this town is like one big family.


I'm sure that little one will get used to
living here soon enough.

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}That {{color id="0"}}new vai{{color id="-1"}} should be arriving sometime
soon, I imagine.

Though I guess the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} will make
it really hard, if not impossible, to reach
the town right now...

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh? You're back again?

---
label: talk0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry,{{delay8}} I don't have time to deal with you
right now.

There's a{{color id="0"}} vai from out of town {{color id="-1"}}arriving
soon and I need to be prepared to
welcome her.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Have you seen the little vai around town?
Little {{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}?

She recently arrived here from out of
town, too, along with her mother, {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}But Perda started working at one of the
{{color id="0"}}shops{{color id="-1"}}... A rather {{color id="0"}}frustrating shop{{color id="-1"}}...

In any case, we rarely see her out and
about anymore.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I think Aaqlet misses her a lot. She
spends so much time looking at the
{{color id="0"}}picture of Perda {{color id="-1"}}on the wall in the {{color id="0"}}shelter{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Thankfully, this town is like one big family.
Everyone is going to look out for her, no
matter whose vehvi she is.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Still, I'm glad the repairs on this place are done.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Huh?


Oh.{{delay15}} You're the voe...


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Sorry,{{delay8}} but the children are sleeping
right now. Tread quietly and try not
to wake them.
It looks like the {{color id="0"}}vai from out of town {{color id="-1"}}have
adjusted to life here.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Knowing that, it makes all the hard work
preparing for them worth it.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Hmph. There are better times to visit
than when they're all sleeping...

It looks like the {{color id="0"}}vai from out of town {{color id="-1"}}have
adjusted to living in town. They run
around playing during the day.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Please let them sleep.

Vai from out of town?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The two newcomers are {{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}
and {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}}.

You can easily tell which two they are—
they're very small!

Aaqlet's mother, {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}, is working at
a...{{color id="0"}}frustrating shop{{color id="-1"}}, so she's rarely seen
around town.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I can tell Aaqlet misses her though.
She keeps going down into the {{color id="0"}}shelter {{color id="-1"}}to
look at {{color id="0"}}Perda{{color id="-1"}}'s picture...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}But I think {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}}'s arrival has cheered
Aaqlet up some. I see her smiling more
often, at least.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} arrived in a yellow balloon.
It was like the sun itself was coming to
set on top of the town.
She's always smiling, even though I'm
sure she's missing her parents a lot.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But that little vai is like the sun, always
beaming brightly!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Huh?


Oh.{{delay15}} You're the voe...


{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry, but I need to go check on the
little ones right now.

There are {{color id="0"}}vai from out of town{{color id="-1"}}, so I've

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Sorry, but I'm feeling pretty drained.
I know it's still bright out, but I want to

If you've got some free time, it'd be great

company, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We prepared this room for {{color id="0"}}Mattison{{color id="-1"}} and
{{color id="0"}}Aaqlet{{color id="-1"}}, who recently came to this town.

But they're not interested in sleeping in
here. They want to sleep where everyone
else sleeps.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If that means they're comfortable here in
town, then I'm all for it.

label: 0003

Goodbye.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup"}}All right, well, I'm going to get a little
more sleep now.

The bed is brand-new, after all. It'd be a
shame to let it go to waste.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}They sure are cute when they're asleep,
aren't they?{{delay8}} After playing all day, they've
really tired themselves out.
Ha, and when they're playing, they go
absolutely everywhere. {{delay8}}I bet these little
ones know more about town than anyone.

label: talk0038

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}They sure are cute when they're asleep,

their dreams too.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Seeing them running around town playing
during the day...

Well, it makes us adults want to do our
very best to keep them safe and set good
examples for them.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}In a way, these little ones are responsible
for keeping everything together!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}They sure are cute when they're asleep,

dreams right now...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Most Gerudo sleep really deeply, you
know.{{delay8}} We get high-quality sleep that way,
which helps us build up our bodies.
It's one of the reasons we grow quicker
than anyone else.

Of course, we sleep less deeply as we
get older...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Ha! I'm told that when I was a child,
hardly anything could wake me from a
sound sleep!
