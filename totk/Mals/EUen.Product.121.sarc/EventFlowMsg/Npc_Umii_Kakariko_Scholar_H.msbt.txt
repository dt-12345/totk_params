get along...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know what I mean?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I don't know what their problem is, but
those two are at each other's throats
from morning to night.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I don't know what their problem is, but

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Back again, huh?


Look at those two. They're still going
at it.

in these hills, but some monsters have set

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Hey now! I've had to listen to them
bickering, so the least you can do is

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} in the {{color id="0"}}nestled{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruin {{color id="-1"}}inscribed with Zonai writing.{{pageBreak}}What if the monsters destroy that

---
label: Talk_0018

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}They ignored the monsters and started
arguing as soon as one of them brought
up who was stronger.
Do they even care whether some awful
monster in the {{color id="0"}}nestled Ring Ruin{{color id="-1"}} destroys{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
that precious {{color id="0"}}slab{{color id="-1"}}?{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}I doubt it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I don't care if they argue, but I want them

It's sure quiet...

label: Talk_0021

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I can't hear the monsters anymore.
Do you know if something happened?

label: Talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}You got rid of all those monsters?! Wow!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You should let those two know you
handled it.

---
label: Talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! I can't wait to get back to
my investigation.

Make sure to let those two know you took
care of the monsters. Not that I want to
see the looks on their faces, but... Well.

label: Talk_0012

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Now that you've chased off the monsters,
I can go back to investigating the stone
slab in the Ring Ruin. Thank you!

I'm glad it's safe now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Don't worry, the monsters didn't get to
the {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} in the ruins. Phew!

Y'know, it feels a little lonely without
those two arguing...

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I can finally investigate without worrying
I'm about to get eaten!

Even better, the {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} and its
precious writing are safe. You did
good work here.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Looks like the monsters are gone for
good. I can finally research in peace.

Best of all, the {{color id="0"}}stone slab{{color id="-1"}} and the
precious writing carved on it are safe.
Thank you. Seriously.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is one of {{color id="0"}}five ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}} that
fell in the area.{{pageBreak}}They're all broken open except for the
{{color id="0"}}floating one {{color id="-1"}}within the village itself.{{pageBreak}}When that happened, chambers with
{{color id="0"}}stone slabs {{color id="-1"}}were exposed. These slabs
provide rare examples of Zonai writing.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Someone placed them very carefully.
They must have been important objects—
I can't believe I get to study them!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Tauro has translated a bit of it already.{{pageBreak}}This particular stone slab seems to detail
requirements for becoming a "sage."{{pageBreak}}Apparently, not only did you need to be
exceptional in some way, you also needed
a secret stone.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I'd never heard of these secret stones
before reading this! {{delay8}}There's still so much
mystery in the world.{{pageBreak}}If you want the exact text, you can read
the {{color id="0"}}translation {{color id="-1"}}next to the stone slab.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It must have been important. {{delay8}}It's a shame
we don't yet know what they meant by
"sage" and "secret stone."
