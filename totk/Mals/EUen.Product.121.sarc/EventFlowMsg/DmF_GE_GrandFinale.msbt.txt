{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Ah, Link...


I am grateful to you for helping me save
the Gerudo.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I've received reports that ever since the
sand shroud dissipated, Gibdo attacks
have almost entirely stopped.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It will no doubt take some time to rebuild,
but it is thanks to your help that we can
live on the surface again.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_13
---
On behalf of all the Gerudo people,
thank you.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}I am sorry to say, though, that despite the
safety of Gerudo Town no longer being a
pressing concern...
we still haven't been able to uncover any
information on the whereabouts of
Princess Zelda.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_04
---
{{anim type="Think_01"}}Actually, Buliara...


I do have a small piece of information
regarding Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I experienced a vision when I took the
secret stone in my hand.

The person that my ancestor referred
to as the Sage of Time looked identical
to Zelda.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_05
---
But it'd be impossible for that person to
be Zelda...wouldn't it?

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_14
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}Hmmm.


My ancestor claimed to have been from
the distant past.

It's just not possible for Zelda to be in
that era...{{delay15}}

{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Hmm. Pay me no mind. I'm just thinking
out loud.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_06
---
Could that person have been Zelda?

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_15
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}Was that Zelda in the distant past? In the
same era when my ancestor was alive?

No, it's just not possible.


After all, we saw someone who looked
exactly like Zelda recently too.

She vanished without saying a word, but
that had to have been Zelda.

{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Hmm...


We're going to have to keep investigating
if we want to find any answers...

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_07
---
What if that was actually Zelda...

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_16
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}Then the Zelda that was in the distant
past... The one my ancestor knew...
That's the real Zelda.
The Zelda we saw has to be someone
else. Things start to fit together if we
assume that much is true.
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Hmmm... There's still more to investigate.
We don't have enough information to
be sure.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_09
---
Someone who just happens to look like
Zelda... That doesn't explain everything
that's been going on.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_17
---
{{anim type="Think_00"}}But it's impossible to deny that someone
resembling Zelda has been spotted across
Hyrule, and that terrible events follow her.
The Zelda we know and the Zelda we saw
in the vision of the distant past are
incredibly similar.
{{anim type="Sad_01"}}If the Zelda in the past is our Zelda,
then who is this other person?

We must uncover her true identity.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I'm sorry, Link. Although the threat of the
sand shroud and the Gibdos has passed...

I cannot leave Gerudo Town at the
moment. Things need some time to settle.

However, we will take on the task of
searching this area for any signs of Zelda.

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_22
---
{{anim type="Understand_01"}}And with my newfound power as a sage,
I will still be able to support you. {{delay15}}I swear
that I will do anything I can to help!

label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_19

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Link... If you are planning on traveling to
the other regions in your investigation,
why don't you visit Lookout Landing?
Hmm? You aren't familiar with
Lookout Landing?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}My understanding is that those concerned
with Princess Zelda's whereabouts and
other recent events are gathering there.
Last I heard, Lookout Landing was
being constructed just south of Hyrule
Castle. Why don't you try heading there?

---
label: Dm_GE_GrandFinale_20

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Link... You said you had already
visited Rito Village, Goron City, and
Zora's Domain...
Hmm. I'm sure Lookout Landing would
welcome any information you could share.

{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I hope your travels bring you back here
again, Link.

I look forward to such a reunion.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble"}}I hate to tell you this, but the attire you
are wearing is...not acceptable.

What I mean to say is...I would ask you to
not dress as an enemy.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're wearing an item identical to what
a group that regularly attacks us wears.

You may return when you are
dressed appropriately.

What I mean to say is...please put more
on before coming into town.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're always welcome in town so long as
you are dressed appropriately.
