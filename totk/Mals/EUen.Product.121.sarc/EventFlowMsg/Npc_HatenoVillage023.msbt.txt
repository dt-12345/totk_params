it's more like an empty lot, but it used to

I need my full night's rest if I don't want
to wake up tired tomorrow.{{pageBreak}}And I've got an early start, so if you don't

What can we grow?

---
label: Talk_3003

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}I'll rattle off the list for you. I can grow...


Pumpkins, {{delay8}}carrots, {{delay8}}tomatoes, {{delay8}}radishes,{{delay8}}
wildberries,{{delay8}} or hydromelons. Wheat and
rice too. Can't forget those.
Oh, and if it's wheat or rice you're after,
remember you gotta {{color id="0"}}cut the plants before
you can harvest 'em{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Also, I should come clean about one
thing. {{delay8}}I have more experience with some
crops than others.
I don't know too much yet about raising
endura carrots and hearty radishes.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You'll have to forgive me if the yield on
those ends up a little lower than the rest.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Anything else you want to know about
farmwork? Or are you ready to roll up

Yes.

---
label: Talk_3009

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}You can leave me to it. Just know that this
kind of work takes time.{{pageBreak}}That's all there really is to raisin' crops,
you know. Love and patience.{{pageBreak}}The veggies take life at their own pace.
Try to hurry things along at an inn or a
fire and you make 'em feel unappreciated.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Once they're ripe for pluckin', they're all
yours, Professor Link. Happy trails.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Looks like you don't have anything we

fine. Just come talk to me about it.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It takes time to raise crops, but once
