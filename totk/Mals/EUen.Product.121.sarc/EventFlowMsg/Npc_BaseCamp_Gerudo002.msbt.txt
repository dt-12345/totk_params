{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hey! What are you... Listen, this is
the lighthouse for the bazaar.

It's not a tourist destination, or a place
to play around on.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}That said, I guess it's fine now that you're
already here. Go ahead and enjoy
the view over the desert.
After all, this is the only place in
Kara Kara Bazaar where you can see
over the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This lighthouse is the only place in
Kara Kara Bazaar where you can see
over the sand shroud.
I'm not really supposed to let regular folks
up here, but since you've made the climb,
you might as well enjoy the view.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is really beautiful at sunrise.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Sunset really brings out the beauty of

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The sand shroud is a real pain, but it does
make it look like {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is floating
in a sea of sand...

I'll fight to the end!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Everyone who can't fight, get to safety!
I will defend this place!

If you want to help, protect the chief!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey!{{delay8}} What's the Yiga Clan doing here?!{{delay15}}


Listen, I'll overlook you getting to this
point—as long as you haven't caused any
trouble—but you must leave.{{delay15}} Now!

label: talk0002

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}It's all thanks to the lighthouse that the 
reinforcements could get here so quickly.

It works like a guidepost, even in this
intense {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}This is the first time we've had a chance
to talk to one another, but I know a lot
about you already.
We fought together at Kara Kara Bazaar,
after all.

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}I was impressed to hear that you are such
close friends with our chief.

And I'm grateful. We would have been in
serious danger if not for your help.

In fact, it would be fair to say that you
saved Gerudo Town.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}That's probably obvious though.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}It's my first time being here in Central
Hyrule... The weather here is so strange!

Who ever heard of a place that's basically
the same temperature in the afternoon
and at night?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Water falls from the sky here... {{delay15}}Is there
an oasis floating up there, do you think?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're looking for Princess Zelda, right?
I heard a rumor that she was spotted at
Hyrule Castle.

---
label: BlackZelda_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My eyes are good enough that I could
count the spikes on a Molduga from a
very, very safe distance...
But even I couldn't see any sign of the
princess without using {{color id="0"}}Purah's telescope{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I was sad to hear that there was no sign
of Princess Zelda at Hyrule Castle...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}You're going to continue searching for the
princess, though, aren't you?

Don't let the safety of this area worry you!
We'll protect it while you continue your
search!

---
label: BlackZelda_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}We Gerudo take full responsibility of
protecting Lookout Landing.

Remain focused on your search for
Princess Zelda. We'll keep this area safe.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Water falling from the sky won't deter us
