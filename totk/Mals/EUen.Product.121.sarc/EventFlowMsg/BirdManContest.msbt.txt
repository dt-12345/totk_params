{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa!{{delay8}} A visitor? That's...new. What are
you doing here?

---
label: Talk49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What is it?{{delay8}} Did you need something
from Mr. Branli?

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Mr. Branli!

---
label: 0011
---
Exploring!

---
label: 0012
---
Who are you?

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hm! {{delay8}}Exploring a remote island like this...{{delay8}}
Very well.

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Answering a question with a question?
That's pretty rude... But very well.

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I am a scholar, presently engaged in
{{color id="0"}}research on the mechanics of flight{{color id="-1"}}.

Mimo and I ran into each other when
I was searching for a test site where
I could perform my experiments.
It was he who suggested this island.

---
label: Talk41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Mr. Branli told me he dreamt of flying
without wings. It was all so intriguing,
I had to get involved.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}You know, I could use a test subj—{{delay8}}
Ah, research assistant.

---
label: Talk58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}What's happening in that head of yours?
Taking an interest in my work, hm?

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hello, young man!{{delay8}} My {{color id="0"}}flight research {{color id="-1"}}is
progressing by the day. Lots of interesting
insights and learnings, yes indeed.
Is that why you're here? You want to
assist me?

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}How about it? Feeling flightworthy?{{delay8}} 
Ready to help with my research?

---
label: 0000
---
I'll do it.

---
label: 0006
---
I need more details.

---
label: 0001
---
No way.

---
label: 0013
---
I'm not interested.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay15}}You could just sit back and let the
science happen, but no. You want all the
ins and outs picked apart... {{delay8}}Fine.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Mimo, fill the young man in!

---
label: Talk40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right... See the object over there that
looks like {{color id="0"}}a set of wings{{color id="-1"}}? {{delay8}}It fell from the
sky recently.
Mr. Branli thinks it may be an ancient
flying device that could be used to {{color id="0"}}soar
freely through the air{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
But at present, that's only an
untested hypothesis.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}We need you to prove or disprove it
by {{color id="0"}}getting on the wings {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}flying {{color id="-1"}}to
the objective.

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}How about it?{{delay8}} Ready to cast off gravity's
cruel bonds and SOAR?

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Marvelous! {{delay8}}You won't regret it!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Now, to be totally candid, we've run into
an unexpected funding shortage...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So I hate to ask, but would you mind
kicking in, oh, let's say {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0007
---
Fine...

---
label: 0008
---
I'm not paying that!

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm.{{delay15}} So, the miracle of flight doesn't
interest you... {{delay8}}That's fine. Let me know if
you change your mind.

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ugh!{{delay8}} Don't you care AT ALL about
supporting science?!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Researchers have to eat, you know!
If you don't contribute, then you don't
get to fly.

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Hrrng!{{delay8}} You don't have enough!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}PLEASE save up and come back!

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Excellent... Thank you for your generous
contribution!

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Mimo!{{delay8}} Ready the wings!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes, Mr. Branli. One moment.

---
label: Talk44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}All ready, sir!

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm.{{delay8}} Seeing as you're new to this
experiment, we had best lay out the
parameters.
Mimo!{{delay8}} Tell the young man what he'll
be doing!

---
label: Talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that you're {{color id="0"}}on the wings{{color id="-1"}}, it's nearly
time to {{color id="0"}}take flight{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk57
---
The rain may limit your visibility
somewhat, but no matter.

---
label: Talk43
---
We are asking you to aim for the {{color id="0"}}center
of the circles {{color id="-1"}}over there. {{delay8}}{{color id="0"}}Land as close
to the target as you can.{{color id="-1"}}
Maneuvering with the wings may be
difficult, but we believe you can steer
by maintaining good balance.
{{anim type="Think_00"}}Note that {{color id="0"}}you may not get off the wings{{color id="-1"}}
until the experiment is complete, as that
would render the data useless.
The closer you get to the goal, the better
data we'll be able to yield, and the more
we'll compensate you for your help!

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Would you like to have the parameters
explained once again?

---
label: 0009
---
No need.

---
label: 0010
---
Yes, please.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Hmm.{{delay8}} I would have expected you to
remember. But very well. It is YOUR life
we're risking, after all...
Mimo!{{delay8}} Refresh the young man's memory!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Ready?{{delay15}} Then fly, bird-man! Flyyy!

---
label: Talk55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hm? What are you doing?

---
label: Talk56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We need those wings for our research.
Please leave them where they are.

---
label: Talk50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*siiigh*{{delay15}} It's raining, and we still aren't
taking a day off.

---
label: Talk51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm also curious how this weather may
affect the wings' aerodynamics.

---
label: Near01
---
You can fly rain or shine!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What?!{{delay8}} What's so important you had to
stop the experiment?{{delay15}} Please don't tell me
you're backing out.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Is something wrong? {{delay8}}Mr. Branli, I think he
wants to talk to you.

---
label: 0004
---
I'm backing out.

---
label: 0005
---
I'll still do it.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Since the experiment already began,
I can't give back the {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}} you
gave me. Is that OK?

---
label: Talk52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Guhhh...{{delay15}} Fine.{{delay8}} Mimo!{{delay8}} Clean this up!

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That's a bold way to talk to your only
employee...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}If you have second thoughts about your
second thoughts, we'll be here.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, then!{{delay8}} Get back out there!

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What are you doing?!{{delay8}} You can't get off
the wings in the middle of the experiment!
{{delay8}}Mimo! {{delay8}}Go pick him up!

---
label: Talk53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! HEY!{{delay8}} How am I supposed to see you
that far away?

Mimo!{{delay8}} Go pick him up!

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You landed...{{delay15}} {{color id="0"}}{{number9 ref="BirdmanContest_Score" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} m {{color id="-1"}}from the center.

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Dear oh dear. {{delay15}}Did you slip and fall off?{{delay8}}
That didn't yield any useful data at all...
No reward for you!

---
label: Talk54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I said to fly to the {{color id="0"}}center of the circles{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}
You've screwed up the entire experiment.{{delay8}}
No reward for you!

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}That was our best flight so far!{{delay8}}


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Here's hoping that you continue to smash
record after record!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}How awe-inspiring!{{delay8}} You landed right
inside the circles! A perfect flight!

Which means that my research is
finally complete!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Mimo!{{delay8}} Give the young man his reward!
He deserves everything we've got!

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That was impressive. Even we Rito can't
fly that accurately.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Here's your reward.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}WONDERFUL! {{delay8}}You looked like a bird
soaring through the heavens!

This will push my research forward by
leaps and bounds!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Mimo!{{delay8}} Give the young man his reward!
And make it big!

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That really was a beautiful flight! {{delay8}}You
controlled the wings like they were an
extension of your body.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Here's your reward.

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm!{{delay8}} Not quite bird-like, but not bad by
any means either!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}This will give me a good starting point
for my research. {{delay8}}Mimo! Give the young
man his reward!

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Well done today. A little more practice
and you'll be flying like a pro.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Here's your reward.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm.{{delay15}} Well, not every experiment can be a
resounding success. I'm sure I'll find
some use for this data in my research.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}In terms of compensation...{{delay15}}I'd say you
earned a small reward. {{delay8}}Mimo!

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Here you are.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hnng...{{delay8}} What happened? You looked
so confident, and yet failed so badly!
This does nothing for my research!
I'm sorry, but I won't give you a reward
for...that!

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Flying is all about equilibrium.{{delay8}}
To maneuver the wings, start from
{{color id="0"}}a position with good balance{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Then to steer, try moving around—
{{color id="0"}}forward, backward, side to side{{color id="-1"}}.
That should, in theory, do the trick!

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You know, I could still use more data...{{delay8}}
Another experiment wouldn't hurt!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}How about it? Want to take to the skies
again?

---
label: 0002
---
Sure!

---
label: 0003
---
No, thanks.

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, marvelous!{{delay8}} The more you fly, the
more my research progresses!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Naturally, I'll need you to provide another
contribution of {{color id="0"}}20 rupees{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm.{{delay8}} So, you had your taste of flight,
and now you're done?{{delay15}} Fine.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, I'll be here, tirelessly working on
my research! {{delay8}}Come back if and when
you're ready to make scientific history!
