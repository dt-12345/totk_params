{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey there. {{delay8}}Are you here because you
spotted the {{color id="0"}}bonfires{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}The blizzard makes it hard to see where
you're going, so we keep these bonfires
going as a beacon for lost travelers.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}They eat up a lot of firewood, but it's
worth it—you can spot them even from
up in the air!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Though as proud as I am of them, they
can't beat the spotlights set up around
that fancy {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}It won't warm you up like a {{color id="0"}}bonfire {{color id="-1"}}will,
but it's hard to beat it for size and
sheer brightness.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}What were they calling it? A {{color id="0"}}Skyview
Tower {{color id="-1"}}or something?{{pageBreak}}It's still dark right now, but when it's
turned on, they say it'll light up the sky
pretty far out.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I doubt it'll warm you up like a {{color id="0"}}bonfire{{color id="-1"}},

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Although... Let's be honest—the {{color id="0"}}Skyview

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}All right, I admit it.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}Once that {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower{{color id="-1"}}'s flashy lights
