{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Whoa, you back?


No, I get it, believe me. This lineup is

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}This {{color id="0"}}Hylian armor series{{color id="-1"}} has caught your
eye too?

label: Talk_1_6

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}The design is so cool, and it fits like a
glove! It's popular with travelers too,
which means it's a must for adventuring.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}At that price, I can afford it if I sell off my {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}}...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}In your case, you should just put
something on. Anything, really.

You're fine walking around like that in

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Aw, shoot. I can't believe the snowquill

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I've been eyeing that beaut for a
while now. But I don't quite have
enough rupees.
Maybe I should sell off my {{color id="0"}}ore {{color id="-1"}}so I can
buy it already...

---
label: Talk_1_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I've been eyeing that beaut for a
while now.

But even if I sell the {{color id="0"}}ore {{color id="-1"}}I've got, it
wouldn't quite be enough.

Maybe I should go rooting around in a
{{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}to look for more.

---
label: Talk_1_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}I've wanted this outfit for a while. Never
thought I'd eventually be able to get it
at Lookout Landing.
Anyway, it's made with Sheikah tech!


Word is you're {{color id="0"}}way quieter {{color id="-1"}}when you run
around in this gear.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}So...that means catching horses would be
easier, for one thing.

And just think about all the surprise
attacks you could unleash on monsters!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But even if I sold the {{color id="0"}}ore {{color id="-1"}}I've got, I still
wouldn't be able to afford it.

Maybe I should go rooting around in a
{{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}for ore.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, you like clothing, too, huh?

---
label: Talk_1_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}This outfit is pretty great, but I've been
obsessing over a different one lately.

Specifically, the {{color id="0"}}stealth series{{color id="-1"}} outfit.
They sell it over in the Sheikah area,
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Word is that it uses Sheikah tech!


I guess wearing it {{color id="0"}}makes you super quiet
when you move{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_1_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I'd love to make a quick trip out to
Kakariko Village to buy some things.

But it's a small village to the southeast,
and it's fairly secluded and hard to find.
I always get lost looking for it...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Although I guess now I could use those
huge {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}as a {{color id="0"}}landmark{{color id="-1"}}, so maybe
I'm fretting over nothing.

---
label: Talk_1_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The outfits here aren't bad.


But I've been drooling over the stealth
clothing that makes you {{color id="0"}}super quiet when
moving around{{color id="-1"}}.
Except it's only sold in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}...


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}If I had that set, I'd be catching horses
left and right. Not to mention all the
{{color id="0"}}surprise attacks{{color id="-1"}}. The possibilities!
It's no wonder everyone wants
that clothing.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Kakariko is small and secluded, so I
always get lost trying to find my
way there.
I suppose now there's those {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
that'll serve as a {{color id="0"}}landmark{{color id="-1"}}, so I'm sure
I'll have no problems next time.

---
label: Talk_1_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Wow... Used to be you could only get
this outfit in a {{color id="0"}}specific area{{color id="-1"}}. Now?
It's available in Lookout Landing.
What a dream! Just look at the quality on
this. The QUALITY. Makes you wanna get
the whole set, don't it?

---
label: Talk_1_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I gotta buy them before they sell out!{{delay15}}


{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Except... I'm kinda broke at the moment. No, wait.
I just need to sell my {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}}!

Oh, hang on... I need more than I have. Better go
find a good {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}to dig some up in.{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk_1_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Aw... I didn't think it'd sell out so fast!
Didn't give me enough time to save up
or anything...
I should've just sold off my {{color id="0"}}ore{{color id="-1"}}...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Whoa... {{delay8}}This thing came crashing down
here. I wonder if I could sell it for my
wardrobe fund.
Then I could buy up ALL the outfits
I've been eyeing.

---
label: Talk_1_38

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If I can sell this thing off, I bet I'd be able

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}So it turned out this stone tablet is crucial
for research...{{delay8}} Here I thought I'd sell it for
some good money.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Looks like I'll have to go the slow, boring
route of saving up money over time for all
those outfits I've been wanting.

---
label: Talk_1_40

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I shouldn't fantasize about selling off
