{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Wait... Link?!


You came here to see Prince Sidon?


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Well, since it's you, that should be no
problem at all.{{delay8}} I'm sure Prince Sidon
will be thrilled to see you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Ever since the Upheaval, Prince Sidon
has been working so tirelessly, he hasn't
been able to return home to the domain.
Lady Yona has been providing leadership
at Zora's Domain in his stead.

{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Our precious Zora's Domain is to the {{color id="0"}}west{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Rivan {{delay8}}is still fussing...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}His only daughter, Dunma, is on a
solo assignment. I can understand
why he'd be worried.
But Dunma is over 60 years old. Sure,
she still has some of the mannerisms of
childhood, but she's a first-rate soldier.

---
label: talk0037

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}As a veteran soldier himself, it's simply
not fitting for him to get distracted just
because he's apart from his daughter.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Only Prince Sidon could keep purifying
that amount of filthy water.

Naturally, Lady Yona can also control the
water like that, but there's a good reason
that she isn't here.
You see, Prince Sidon asked her to watch
over the infirmary.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}It turns out she really was the best Zora
for the job!{{delay8}} That role was perfect for
Lady Yona, who is kindness incarnate.
While the young ones are in the
throne room, {{delay8}}he's generating water and
overseeing the investigation of the ruins.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Prince Sidon's command is exceptional,
to say the least!

---
label: talk0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's no small task to continuously clean
that amount of dirty water.

On top of that, he must also deploy
everyone where they're needed most and
oversee the investigation of the ruins.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Prince Sidon really is amazing!

---
label: talk0044

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The water that Prince Sidon has cleansed
flows from Mipha Court to Zora's Domain.

That's why we can climb the waterfalls
from the domain all the way here.

{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I really wish we had been able to return
your {{color id="0"}}Zora armor {{color id="-1"}}to you, Link. It would be
really useful to you about now.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But I hear she needs some kind of special
fish in order to finish repairing the armor.{{delay15}}
Hm...{{delay8}} I wonder kind of fish.
That reminds me that Gruve is over by
Mipha's statue, and he said he's seen
some unusual fish there recently.
