{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}This is a shop where you can buy cooking
ingredients, plus all sorts of other stuff!{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Although we haven't gotten much
business since the blizzard took out
the bridge...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, mister, have you seen the building
with the big horse on top of it {{color id="0"}}across
the bridge{{color id="-1"}}?{{pageBreak}}The people there make these kind of thin

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Sorry our shelves are kinda empty. {{delay15}}It's
'cause of all the heavy snowstorms.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you need food, like {{color id="0"}}fish {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}mushrooms{{color id="-1"}},
you could try poking around in the caves
outside of town.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}There's a bunch of {{color id="0"}}caves {{color id="-1"}}along the road
to the east, and even more of them in the
Hebra Mountains.

label: Talk1012_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you poke around inside the caves, you
might find {{color id="0"}}fish {{color id="-1"}}or {{color id="0"}}mushrooms {{color id="-1"}}that I don't
have for sale right now.{{pageBreak}}Try the road to the east of here or up in
the Hebra Mountains to see if you can
find any {{color id="0"}}cave {{color id="-1"}}entrances.

---
label: Com_Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="-1"}}All right. How many were you thinking?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}{{color id="-1"}}Sure. That'll be {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}, OK?

---

---
label: Com_Talk_52

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}You want {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}? Ummm...that'll be
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 5507

---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}Our whole stock?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Ummm, we have {{number15 ref="Shop_TradeItemNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} on hand, so...
That'd come to {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: 5503

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Whoa, hey, you changed your mind?

label: Com_Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh nooo! You don't have enough rupees
to pay for that, mister.

---
label: Com_Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Huh? Your bag's all full. We can fix that!
Just sell me anything you don't need!
