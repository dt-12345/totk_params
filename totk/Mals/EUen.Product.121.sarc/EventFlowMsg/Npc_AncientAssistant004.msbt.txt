{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hey, I know that face!


And any face I know is the face of
a friend!

Please, Link. Help yourself to anything in
this shelter. It's all yours to {{color id="0"}}use as you
see fit{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}But don't you dare go making a mess
of this place and kicking up dust!

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}I spend so much time cleaning in here,
and there's still endless amounts of dust.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Where does all this dust even come
from, anyway?

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}Why? Why does this spot, specifically,
get so dusty?!

I'm fed up with all the dust.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Anyhow. Help yourself to anything in this
shelter. It's all yours to {{color id="0"}}use however
you want{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}But don't you dare go making a mess

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}I went to town with a broom in here just a
bit ago, and POOF. MORE DUST.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Where does this level of dust even come

So beautiful.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you greeted the Goddess today?
She watches over Hyrule, you know.

Good morning, good night, see you later,
I'm home.

{{anim type="Chat_01"}}It's important to touch base with
the Goddess.

label: Talk_2_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}Good morning, good night, see you later,
I'm home.

Those who don't converse with the
Goddess regularly are not to be trusted.

How are you doing?

label: Talk_2_8

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I can't hear that frightening voice
anymore. I bet even the {{color id="0"}}horned
statue{{color id="-1"}} is feeling better now!

---
label: Talk_2_3
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you said hi to the {{color id="0"}}horned statue{{color id="-1"}}?


After hearing the story from you, I make
sure to say hello to both the Goddess and
the {{color id="0"}}horned statue{{color id="-1"}} too.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I never hear that frightening voice
anymore. I bet the horned statue is
feeling better for it too!

---
label: Talk_2_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What is it? I'm busy cleaning the dais for
the {{color id="0"}}horned statue{{color id="-1"}}.

The horned statue?

---
label: Talk_2_6
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}"A dealer in life and power, touched by
the wrath of the Goddess, fallen to ruin."

So the horned statue must be the entity
who deals in life and power...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}Which would make the dais the place
where it was enshrined, back when
it was still a god.
As there is the Goddess of light, then it
follows that she would have an opposite—
the horned god.
Like light and dark, one cannot exist
without the other—their power manifests
through the other's existence.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's what I think, anyway. And that's
all I've got for you. I'm going back to
work now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Once I've cleaned up the {{color id="0"}}horned statue{{color id="-1"}}'s
dais, I've got the {{color id="0"}}Goddess Statue {{color id="-1"}}to tidy.
