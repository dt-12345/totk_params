{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}To start...{{delay15}}did you know that there's
actually a {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}} right nearby?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There's an opening in the ground north
of us that leads into it.{{pageBreak}}I didn't find many ingredients in there
when I poked my head in, but I did see
a fair share of {{color id="0"}}ore deposits{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Break one of those with a {{color id="0"}}hammer{{color id="-1"}} or
something and you're in for a treat.{{pageBreak}}There's flint for starting fires, {{delay8}}rock salt

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Caves are tricky things. {{delay8}}Sometimes
passages—or even the entrance—can
be completely blocked by rocks.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}If that happens, the only way through is
through. You just have to {{color id="0"}}smash those
pesky rocks{{color id="-1"}}!
{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Regular swords and spears won't do
you any good though. You'll need a
{{color id="0"}}hammer{{color id="-1"}}-like implement with a blunt tip.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So it never hurts to be prepared to smash
some rocks before you enter a cave.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}And hey, a blocked path isn't all bad.
Sometimes you'll even find ore in the
rocks you've smashed!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}If you're exploring a cave and find your

your way through!
And to do so, a {{color id="0"}}hammer{{color id="-1"}}-like implement
with something blunt on the end is
absolutely essential.
{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Sometimes you'll even find weapons and
ore in the rocks you've smashed. {{delay15}}So it
never hurts to have a hammer on hand!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Funny thing about the rocks that block
off the passages in a cave... Different
{{color id="0"}}rocks have different toughness{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The harder ones take multiple hammer
blows to break through.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Given that, I should probably prepare a
more {{color id="0"}}powerful hammer{{color id="-1"}} for myself.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Maybe I could replace the head of my

some {{color id="0"}}hard material{{color id="-1"}} I could use?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Have you ever seen {{color id="0"}}glowing cave fish{{color id="-1"}}
flitting about in cave pools? How about
{{color id="0"}}brightcap{{color id="-1"}} mushrooms?
Both are rare organisms found only in
caves and wells.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Though I suppose their rarity is less
important than their glowiness.{{pageBreak}}If you cook and eat either one of them,
they'll make your body {{color id="0"}}glow{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}Isn't that neat? {{delay15}}It's just a slight glow and

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Are you familiar with {{color id="0"}}hearty truffles{{color id="-1"}}?
They're valuable and delicious fungi.{{pageBreak}}You used to be able to find them on the
surface, but lately, I've only been able to
find them in {{color id="0"}}caves and wells{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Hearty truffles are black and tend not to
stand out,{{delay15}} so it's important to keep a
watchful eye out when searching for them.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Though rumor has it that a few lucky
people have stumbled onto {{color id="0"}}white hearty
