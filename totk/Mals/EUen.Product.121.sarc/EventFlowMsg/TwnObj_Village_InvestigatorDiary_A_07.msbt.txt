The Stone Slab at the Nestled Ring Ruin:
Some Translation Notes
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 　-Tauro{{pageBreak}}"Those who...most elite among the...
granted...qualifications...are chosen
as sages...{{pageBreak}}"Those...worthy...secret stones...and
henceforth...sages."{{pageBreak}}Clearly, the sages are the subject of
this slab.{{pageBreak}}Filling in the blanks, I think it's basically
saying, "Talented individuals become
sages by taking up secret stones."
