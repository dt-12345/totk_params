Long ago, a monstrosity of the sands
attacked Gerudo Town. Its war cry rang
out over the dunes like a raging demon.{{pageBreak}}We seven heroines of the Gerudo—the
most stalwart, chosen vai—surged forth
to engage it.{{pageBreak}}Yet this monstrosity tossed us about like
the tumbling weeds. We feared that the
proud Gerudo would be extinguished.{{pageBreak}}And then...a hero appeared from afar.
He marshaled the seven heroines,
counseling us to combine our strengths.{{pageBreak}}The strength upon strength of we seven
routed the monstrosity. We named our
benefactor, "the guiding light of Gerudo."{{pageBreak}}Yet though we had naught but the highest
praise for him, he was refused entry into
Gerudo Town.{{pageBreak}}'Twas Gerudo law that all those like him
were barred.{{pageBreak}}How hollow our gratitude and praise
must have rung in this hero's ears!{{pageBreak}}Thus was the link between his people and
the Gerudo severed.{{pageBreak}}Though we never bequeathed it to him,
the gift into which our feelings are bound
is enshrined at this sanctuary.

ruler imprisoned the Demon King.{{pageBreak}}To ensure the king's magic would hold,
we erected a castle here to protect
this sacred site.{{pageBreak}}Without the castle in place, the site may
be disturbed, allowing the Demon King's
hatred and rage to be revived.{{pageBreak}}The preservation of this castle is therefore
tied to the prosperity of the kingdom.{{pageBreak}}May it watch over an eternal peace.
