How disappointing...

---
label: Dm_GA_0015_Text_001_b
---
This world should be shrouded in darkness, not
bathed in insufferable light.

label: Dm_GA_0015_Text_002_b

All these weak, peace-loving cowards
running rampant...

It would have been more...satisfying to overcome a
worthy foe.

Do not look away.

You witness a king's revival.

label: Dm_GA_0015_Text_009_b

And the birth of his new world!
