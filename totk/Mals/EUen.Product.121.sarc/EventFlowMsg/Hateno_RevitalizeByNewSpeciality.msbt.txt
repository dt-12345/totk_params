{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, you're...the traveler I saw at
Ventest Clothing, right?{{pageBreak}}Did you come to check up on me because
you were worried?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Yeah...I lost my head a little there. I'm not
too proud of the way I behaved.{{pageBreak}}But don't you worry about me. {{delay8}}I have a
couple {{color id="0"}}tricks up my sleeve against Cece{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}I might not be able to pull one of them off
in time for the mayoral election.{{pageBreak}}So I'm focusing on the second plan—to
bring back a {{color id="0"}}taste{{color id="-1"}} no one's tried here
in years.

What kind of taste?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Way back when, {{delay8}}my grandfather worked
with {{color id="0"}}someone from the village{{color id="-1"}} to create
a special kind of food.{{pageBreak}}It was too ahead of its time to catch on,{{delay8}}
so it never went further than the first trial
run, but I never forgot it.{{pageBreak}}Even today, I can still recall the {{color id="0"}}gooey
mouthfeel{{color id="-1"}} of the one bite my grandfather
shared with me.{{pageBreak}}In the back of my mind, I've always
wanted to make it a {{color id="0"}}signature staple{{color id="-1"}}
of this village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}If I could accomplish that, then I'd have
something that could stand up to Cece!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Except...{{delay8}}I can't remember {{color id="0"}}who{{color id="-1"}} in the
village my grandfather worked with or
{{color id="0"}}what they created{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}And now that I think of it, it also had a unique,
pungent scent. If I could just smell that {{color id="0"}}aroma{{color id="-1"}}
again, it might jog my memory.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Ahh, but don't worry about my problems.
I hope you have a nice, relaxing time in

food{{color id="-1"}} my grandfather created with {{color id="0"}}a fellow

{{color id="0"}}who{{color id="-1"}} in the village my grandfather worked

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Unconscious_00"}}Sorry about that.{{pageBreak}}I didn't mean to imply that the unique,

with a new {{color id="0"}}signature staple{{color id="-1"}}, and I guess
I have interesting smells on the brain.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}This is it... {{delay8}}This is just what I've been

{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}{{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}! Of course!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It makes sense that my grandfather would
have been working with someone from the
farm up there.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}It's a miracle that Koyin not only found
the recipe but managed to reproduce it.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}But this is great news! It's a clear sign
that we ought to make Hateno cheese a
{{color id="0"}}new village staple{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}That ought to swing the election for me.{{pageBreak}}Let me pay you for that cheese, OK?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_00"}}Believe me, it's worth every rupee!{{pageBreak}}Now then! {{delay8}}I should get in touch with
Koyin so we can start preparing for
mass production.{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I'll ask the Hateno Village {{color id="0"}}general store{{color id="-1"}}
and some {{color id="0"}}traveling merchants{{color id="-1"}} to add it to
their wares too.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Shouldn't take much more than that to tip
the election my way. {{delay8}}You should come out

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The {{color id="0"}}mayoral election{{color id="-1"}} begins soon, if I
