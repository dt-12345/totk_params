{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Hm?{{delay15}} Ah,{{delay8}} Link!


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'd heard that you and Princess Zelda
had gone missing. I'm thrilled to see
you alive and well!
But where's Princess Zelda?

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}What?!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}So, Princess Zelda is still missing.{{delay15}}
Well then, Link...

You may want to meet with {{color id="0"}}Lady Impa{{color id="-1"}}.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}She's investigating the {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} that
have appeared across the land—a curious
name for this strange phenomenon.
Lady Impa believes that they're crucial
to the search for Princess Zelda.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}She's traveling in one of those new
balloon contraptions and should be at
{{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable {{color id="-1"}}right now.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'm in a hurry to meet with Lady Impa,
but I can't go anywhere nearly as fast as
she can in her balloon.
Let's see... {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable {{color id="-1"}}is just a
little to the northwest of central Hyrule.

If you'll excuse me, I need to be on
my way!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, Link! We meet again!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you found any clues as to where
Princess Zelda might be?

Lady Impa believes she has found a
source of information that might help
in the search for Princess Zelda.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd suggest that you go meet with
Lady Impa.

She should be at {{color id="0"}}New Serenne Stable {{color id="-1"}}in
North Hyrule Plain.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}I'm trying to reach her myself, but I'm
sorry to say that I'm so bad with
directions, I haven't gotten there yet.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I hope to get there soon though, so
forgive me if I excuse myself!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hmm?! You...{{delay15}} You...{{delay8}}are Link, right?


{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Ha! I've been around a long time. You're
not going to fool me!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}I'd heard that both you and Princess
Zelda had gone missing. I'm thrilled to
see you alive and well!
But where's Princess Zelda?

She is standing on the ruins over there.
Please, go see her.
