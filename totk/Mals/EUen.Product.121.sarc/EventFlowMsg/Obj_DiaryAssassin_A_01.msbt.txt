We've now taken over the Sheikah lab,
and filled out the map with the locations
of our hideout and branches.
The lab is located near a local stable. It's
also not far from Tarrey Town, which was
impacted by falling Zonai ruins and parts.
Suffice it to say, I think both of these
locations will be suitable for procuring
supplies and intel.
Though we haven't yet received any word
of Zelda, there have been many reported
sightings of her swordsman, Link.
His days are numbered, though, as the
surface division is setting up a network
of their terrifying banana traps.
I'm embarrassed to say I've fallen for one
myself... Tempting though it may be, try
not to pick any bananas up off the road.
