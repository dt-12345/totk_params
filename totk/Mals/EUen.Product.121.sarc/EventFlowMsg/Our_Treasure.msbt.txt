Almost got iiit...

label: Near02
---
The treasure...

---
label: Near03
---
He took it...

---
label: Near04
---
Hmmm, I can hardly see...

---
label: Near05
---
This rain's a nuisance.

---
label: Talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I've almost figured it out. Just a bit more
brainstorming, and... Hmm...

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You've got this, Dak! That treasure is as
good as ours!

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Hang on a sec, Prissen.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}Hey! You! We're having a private
conversation here!

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}Oh, it's you. You know it's rude to
eavesdrop, right?

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Huh? What are you— How long have you
been there?!

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}So you used the rain to sneak up on us,
did you?

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}It's hard to keep an eye out in this rain.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}We found that chest first! It's ours!


I mean, it's in a {{color id="0"}}bottomless bog{{color id="-1"}} of certain
doom{{delay8}} with no place to {{color id="0"}}put your feet{{color id="-1"}}, so
you probably can't get to it anyway.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}But any {{color id="0"}}hidden treasure{{color id="-1"}} that's maybe,
certainly, definitely in there is OURS!

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Prissen! Cut it out!

---
label: Talk08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}S-{{delay8}}sorry, Dak.{{delay15}} It just slipped out.

---
label: Talk09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Yeesh. I need to think about how to get
that treasure, so do your job and keep
watch. Got it?

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}As you can see, we're working here.
So buzz off.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Put the foothold there...{{delay15}} No, higher...


If it weren't for this {{color id="0"}}bottomless bog{{color id="-1"}},
getting the treasure would be a piece
of cake.

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The rain only makes things worse too.
How are we gonna get through this?

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}D-Dak... I'm not sure how to tell you
this, but...

The treasure is gone.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Wha?! Prissen, you were supposed to
be keeping watch!

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I WAS keeping watch!

---
label: Talk44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}I mean, yeah, I had to squint through the
rain, but my gaze never once left the bog!{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}That guy took it! I was watching him the
whole time!

---
label: Talk15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}You gotta tell me these things. Keeping
watch means you have to do more than
just...watch.

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Ah, well. Can't get 'em all. No use crying
about it.

You know, you're pretty good. Almost
as good as us at hunting treasure.

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Ah, well. Can't get 'em all. {{delay8}}No use crying
about it.
{{pageBreak}}You're pretty good, y'know. You might
just make it as a treasure hunter!

---
label: Talk42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Wait, don't tell me you're after Misko's
treasure too...

---
label: Talk41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Surely you've heard the rumors that
Misko hid pieces of their famous
{{color id="0"}}clothing collection {{color id="-1"}}across Hyrule.

---
label: Talk48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}The problem is, so did everyone else.
Every would-be treasure hunter in the
kingdom is out to expand their wardrobe.

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh? You're a treasure hunter too? Are
you also going after {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasu{{color id="-1"}}—

---
label: Talk18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}Prissen! Hush!

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Uh, sorry. Just ignore him.

---
label: 0001
---
Misko's treasure?

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful_01"}}So much for the "just ignore him" gambit.{{delay8}}

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There's no way you're also a treasure
hunter if you don't know about {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}}, so we can tell you a little.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Misko {{color id="-1"}}was one of the greatest bandits
Hyrule ever saw. And not just a bandit...

They were also a fashionista. Rumor has it
Misko's renowned {{color id="0"}}clothing collection{{color id="-1"}} is
hidden somewhere in Hyrule.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}We think the clothes are hidden in the
{{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} that appeared during the Upheaval!

Like up ahead in the Eldin region.
You couldn't really explore back
when Death Mountain was erupting.
But now everything's cooled down, and
the place is all rocky and rugged.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}There are probably tons of secret {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}
perfect for hiding treasure!

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Runaway_00"}}PRISSEN!{{delay15}} What...are...you...doing?!

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}Haha, {{delay15}}um, {{delay8}}oops. Definitely forget he
said anything.

---
label: Talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I've almost got it... Almooost...


Maybe we can get the treasure chest if
we... {{delay15}}Huh?

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}H-{{delay8}}hey! Prissen! {{delay8}}Where'd the treasure go?

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The treasure? Oh, that guy took it.

---
label: Talk40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}The treasure? Oh, he took it.

---
label: Talk29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Wha... Weren't you keeping watch?!

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Hey, Dak! Let's head to those caves to
get {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Can't get soaked by rain or struck by
lightning if we're in a cave, right?

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Before, you couldn't get close to Eldin
with the lava and all.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But now that it's cooled off, I'll bet there
are lots of {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}} no one knows about!

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,1]"}}{{anim type="Work_00"}}Prissen! What did I tell you about
keeping quiet?
