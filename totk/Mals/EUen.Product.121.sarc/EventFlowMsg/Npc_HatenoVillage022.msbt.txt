{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}You collect some hot-footed frogs for me,
I collect a few more myself, and Ms. Ivee
will be swept right off her feet!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Or so that friend's friend I was talking
about said, I think. {{delay8}}Either way, I owe
you one.{{pageBreak}}So...did you want something?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I'm here on duty, checking on Ms. Ivee.{{delay8}}
Sorry, no. {{delay15}}I mean I'm keeping watch over
the village entrance.{{pageBreak}}Too busy for chat, sad to say.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It's a wild world outside the village, what
with all the Upheaval stuff going on.
I gotta hold fast and protect Ms. Ivee.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It's a wild world outside the village, what

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thanks to the Cece brand, we see more
people coming and going from the village.{{pageBreak}}I'm just checking out the beauties—{{delay15}}
Uh, I mean tourists— Wait, I mean
suspicious characters! Yeah, that's it!{{pageBreak}}Although...{{delay8}}now that you brought up
beauties, no one else holds a candle
to Ms. Ivee.{{pageBreak}}Then again, {{delay8}}the {{color id="0"}}princess {{color id="-1"}}of Hyrule Castle
who used to stay in the house to the
{{color id="0"}}south {{color id="-1"}}of the village? {{delay8}}She was all right.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Still didn't hold a candle to
Ms. Ivee though.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yeah, some folks in the village are going
ahead with preparations for the elections
for the next mayor.{{pageBreak}}Things between Cece and Reede got
pretty heated, I guess.{{pageBreak}}Not that I much care who's mayor around
this place.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Although, here's a thought. What if I was
mayor? {{delay8}}I bet things would turn around
for me then, yes, sir.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We had that election to decide who's
gonna be the next village mayor.{{pageBreak}}Well, sort of. In the end, Cece withdrew
from the race, so Reede's gonna keep
being mayor by default.{{pageBreak}}They both care a little too much about
what happens to the village, if you
ask me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Maybe I should've thrown my hat in.{{delay8}}
I bet things would turn around for me
if I was mayor, yes, sir.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It's gotta be tough out there what with
the Upheaval. Stuff falling out of the sky,
monster attacks left and right...{{pageBreak}}Not here though. Yours truly keeps
watch over the entrance, day and night,
to make sure of it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}See you. And if you're thinking of making
a move on the ladies, do it someplace
else, will ya?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well?{{delay8}} Need me for anything else?
I'm kinda busy checking out the
village entrance.{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}How come it's never a cute girl that comes along
to distract me from watch duty?{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}
