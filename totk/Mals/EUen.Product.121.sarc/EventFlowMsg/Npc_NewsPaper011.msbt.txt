{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Seems like that big cold snap in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}It started pouring so suddenly! You really
shouldn't be out in weather like this.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Don't get in my way today! I'm ready for
some fun!

The rain's stopped, and I want to get
outside to read my newspaper.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}When I read in a quiet place with a breeze
blowing, I can get a better sense of the
world. That's just how it works for me.
