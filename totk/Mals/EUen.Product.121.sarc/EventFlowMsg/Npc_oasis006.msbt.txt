{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're the chief's guest, right? Since it's
a special occasion, would you like to try
my spa plan?
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I used to run a shop on the surface, but...


what with the sand shroud and then
those monsters appearing, the guards
told me to evacuate.
I had six months' worth of reservations
booked, but obviously those haven't been
happening. I'm a bit out of practice...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But good news for you, I guess! You can
rest, or you can take advantage of the spa
plan without having to wait!

---
label: talk0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Living in an underground shelter takes
more of a toll on the mind and body
than you would think...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But with my spa plan, you can send both
on a relaxing journey!

label: talk0007

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}When I was still running my shop on the
surface, I had a very...enthusiastic client.

I had to shut down and move here without
any warning though... I hope she's doing
all right.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well...{{delay8}} Worrying isn't going to get me
anywhere. All I can do right now is help
those who are down here.

---
label: talk0006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}How about it? Do you want to rest here?

---
label: near0001

Time to relax?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hey! You! Aren't you the voe who helped
the chief and the others save the town?!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm glad you came! While we are an inn,
we also have a spa plan available.

It's a really popular part of the inn.
In fact, there's always a long list
of reservations.
But you did save the town, after all, so
you're a bit of a special case... You can
skip the line whenever you want!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's the least I can do! Just let me know
when if you want to relax!

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}It's you! You're pretty amazing, you know
that? I heard you helped the chief and the
others save the town!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I bet the benefits of my spa plan played
at least a small part in that, huh?

As usual, I'm booked solid right now. But
I'll always make an exception for you—the
spa plan is yours whenever you like!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's the least I can do! Just let me know
when you want to relax!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I had a feeling I'd be seeing you right
about now!

I bet you're feeling more worn out than
a sand seal after a long race, huh?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Come now, don't worry yourself!
You deserve a rest!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You're not familiar with the spa plan?


Ah, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
A voe wouldn't know much about our
town, after all...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Anyway, the spa plan we offer will fill you
with energy and a truly unique feeling of
resilience to great dangers.
And as an extra bonus, it'll feel like years
of worry have been washed away, leaving
your skin bright and smooth.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Show me someone who wouldn't
appreciate that, and I'll show you
someone who's wrong, haha!

a voe, after all.

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}What's this... You don't have enough
money! You can't stay if you can't pay

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm... I suppose Olu could use
some practice.

She's still learning, so she sometimes
doesn't get everything quite right. But
I would discount the spa plan for you!

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh...just the standard stay, huh?


Passing on the chance to skip the line for
the spa plan?{{delay8}} All right, I guess...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The spa plan it is!{{delay8}} Hee-hee, I'm so excited
to get to work...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, and of course you can choose when
you'd like your wake-up call to be.
What were you thinking?

In the morning!
