{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}What could be powering the Zonai devices? Could
there really be a tiny spirit inside?{{delay8}} No, that doesn't
seem likely...{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}A nuanced understanding of the strange power of
the Zonai civilization would broaden the scope of the
practical application of the devices.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Could the light pattern on Zonai devices have an
application as a form of luminescent guidance?

I can only speculate, of course, as verification of my
hypotheses is impossible.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Zonai devices are as solid as metal. I wonder what
they're made out of...{{size value="100"}}

Now, what's in the sky?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Ah, apologies. I was lost in thought.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The Zonai devices here all fell from
the sky.

I've surveyed various regions, but I
haven't seen devices in this quantity
anywhere but Tarrey Town.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}My research into practical application is
progressing well! I've studied the Zonai
civilization for a long time.
To us Zonai-obsessed research team
members, this place is paradise.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You're free to take what you please.
Removal will not hinder my research.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmm. For so many Zonai devices to be concentrated
in one area, could they still be in production on the
sky islands? {{delay8}}Is that even possible?{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You're free to take these Zonai
devices. Removing them will not
hinder my research.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmm. For this concentration of Zonai devices to
have fallen, could they still be in production in the
sky islands? {{delay8}}Is that even possible?{{size value="100"}}

We'll request more.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}We've exhausted the supply here, so we
have to request the retrieval of additional
Zonai devices.
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Still, for this concentration of Zonai devices to have
fallen, could they still be in production in the sky
islands? {{delay8}}Is that even possible?{{size value="100"}}
