Should I go?

---
label: talk0004
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I hope the chief is OK... Maybe I should go after
her? But I'm just the attendant to {{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}}.

I would be acting against her wishes too...


If I were to go, though, I could just go through here.
It comes out at the {{color id="0"}}northern ruins{{color id="-1"}}, and that's where
the chief was headed...{{size value="100"}}

---

Patricia?

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, my apologies...

---
label: talk0005

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Patricia is the chief's beloved sand seal.


You've heard of sand seals, right?
They're desert creatures that can navigate
the dunes with amazing ease!
And Patricia is a very special one. She
seemingly has the {{color id="0"}}power of an oracle{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Or, she did. Ever since the Upheaval,
she's mostly just been sharing these
{{color id="0"}}strange numbers{{color id="-1"}}...
I've been her attendant for years now,
but even I can't make sense of this turn
of events.

---
label: talk0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}She's off with the chief right now. They
headed out to the {{color id="0"}}northern ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

If you want to speak with {{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}}, you'll
probably have to wait until things have
settled down and the chief isn't so busy.

---
label: 1001
---
Northern ruins?

---
label: talk0000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The chief went to train in the
northern ruins.

She rode out there with her beloved
sand seal, {{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm worried though. {{delay8}}There have been a
lot of these strange monsters popping up
in the world lately.
But as worried as I am, this frustrating
{{color id="0"}}sand shroud {{color id="-1"}}makes it impossible to
navigate the desert.
The chief has an amazing sense of
direction, but I'm not so lucky.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So instead of traveling aboveground,
I was thinking of using this secret passage
to get to the {{color id="0"}}northern ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

I'll leave you be...

---

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those strange monsters are still lurking out there...{{delay15}}
Tsk,{{delay15}} I should've insisted on coming with her,
dangerous or not.{{size value="100"}}

{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Ugh, I can't stop myself from worrying about
the chief.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I wish this voe would go and check on her for me.


At least then I'd be able to rest a little easier...{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: talk0007
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The chief received a report earlier that
{{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}'s in trouble, and it caused the
color to drain out of her face...
I hope the chief and {{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}} are both OK...{{size value="100"}}

---

Kara Kara Bazaar?

---
label: talk0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Kara Kara Bazaar is the oasis near the
path into the desert.

On any normal day, you'd be able to
follow the road northeast straight out
of town and arrive there, but...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{size value="80"}}With this {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}... I think the only ones who
could make it there right now would be the chief
or {{color id="0"}}Patricia{{color id="-1"}}.
Hmm...{{delay15}} No, I think as long as I can see the {{color id="0"}}light of
the lighthouse{{color id="-1"}}, I'd be able to make it too.{{size value="100"}}

Is Kara Kara Bazaar OK?

---
label: talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I've been gathering materials that I think
might be useful in battle. Feel free to take
anything you need from here!
Also, I'm confident that I can build a
barricade at any of the gates.

Would that help you?

I'm OK for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Ah. Yes, I gathered up some weapons and
the materials to improve them. There's
also some food...{{delay8}}oh, and some rupees.
Some of the troops found these strange
capsules while patrolling, so those are
here too.
And of course,{{delay8}} if things get really dire...{{pageBreak}}Like, {{delay8}}say, {{delay8}}if your bows all break or you run
out of arrows {{color id="0"}}in the middle of the battle{{color id="-1"}},
I can help you there too.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm happy to help you with materials or by
setting up a barricade. Just let me know.

---

Hmm. Barricade building...

---
label: talk44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There are three gates... {{delay8}}From the palace,
the north gate is ahead, the west gate is
left, and the east gate is right.
I've got an idea for a barricade... I'll use
iron barrels and wood to block the path.

Which gate should I set it up at?

---
label: talk26
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I built the barricade at the {{color id="0"}}north gate{{color id="-1"}}, but
I can move it if you want it somewhere

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}OK, the barricade has been set up at the

for now.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}That's the same gate where the spear
