They're calling it {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}. Apt name
for it, I'd say.{{pageBreak}}Strange ruins fell from the sky onto the
plains west of here, and there are reports
of spindly, mechanical monsters.{{pageBreak}}This sort of thing is happening all over
Hyrule, apparently.{{pageBreak}}I'm fortunate that neither I nor my home
were harmed, but such an event is sure to
have caused major damage elsewhere.{{pageBreak}}The more outlandish rumors suggest that
Hyrule Castle has risen into the sky.
Rather difficult to credit that one.{{pageBreak}}What could have caused all this? I can
feel the desire to find the truth welling
up within me.

I received a visitor. He was a researcher
from some outfit calling themselves the
Zonai Survey Team.{{pageBreak}}He claimed to be merely passing through
the area, but clearly he had come to draw
on my expertise.{{pageBreak}}According to his story, large ruins have
fallen on {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}, northwest of
this house.{{pageBreak}}People are calling them the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}A great many inquisitive types like me
are gathering in Kakariko Village to
investigate them.{{pageBreak}}I see little choice but to join them.
Without my intellect, they're bound to
leap to all the wrong conclusions.{{pageBreak}}The man history will remember as The
Genius Dr. Calip shall solve this mystery
faster than I can clean my glasses!

My preparations are complete. It's time
for me to depart for Kakariko Village.{{pageBreak}}I foresee a day not long off when all the
members of this survey team address me
with respect and by my proper title.{{pageBreak}}I will not return to this house until I am
known by all as a doctor—nay, as
a genius.{{pageBreak}}This area has long been plagued by
monsters, so I will leave this house in
good order as a place of refuge.{{pageBreak}}To you travelers who might read what
I have penned here, rest well.{{pageBreak}}You are of course welcome to use any of
the things I have left behind.
