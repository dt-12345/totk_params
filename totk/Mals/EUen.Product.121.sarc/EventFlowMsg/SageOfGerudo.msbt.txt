{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Link, I'd like your help with this.


Fire an arrow toward that {{color id="0"}}dummy{{color id="-1"}}. If I aim
for the arrow with my lightning...

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Link... Everyone... I believe in all of you!

---
label: Talk_02
---
{{anim type="Determination_00"}}OK, here we go! {{color id="0"}}When I've charged up
enough power{{color id="-1"}}, you can show me where
to strike by firing an arrow!

---
label: Talk_29
---
{{anim type="Angry"}}That hive... It opens up whenever more
enemies emerge. I bet I can destroy it
with my lightning strikes!

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Yes! We've destroyed the hive! All that's
left is to clean up the remaining monsters!

---
label: Talk_03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Work"}}If Lady Riju falls, it's all over.

label: Talk_04

{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Work"}}These monsters stand no chance!

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}The Gibdos just keep coming. If we can't
destroy that hive, we'll be overrun!

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Work"}}The flood of monsters has been stopped!
Let's wipe out the stragglers!

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The sand shroud, the sudden appearance
of the Gibdos and their hives... Strange
events keep happening, one after another.
And we saw Zelda near Kara Kara Bazaar,
but she hasn't been seen anywhere
around Gerudo Town.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}There's something bigger going on, but
for now, we need to focus on the problem
at hand and {{color id="0"}}prepare to fight{{color id="-1"}}.
Link, I need your help again.


Speak with Buliara and the soldiers,
and help us organize our defenses.

label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}We must prepare for battle.

---
label: Talk_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Are the preparations complete?

---
label: Talk_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}I see. {{delay8}}Let me know when they are
ready, then.

---
label: 0000
---
They are.

---
label: 0001
---
Not quite.

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Do you have questions about preparing
for the battle?

---
label: 0002
---
What's the plan?

---
label: 0003
---
Tell me about the enemy.

---
label: 0004
---
Never mind.

label: Talk_12

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The Gibdos we've encountered in the
desert do not fall easily when struck.
Attacks only seem to dull a blade...
But {{color id="0"}}fire {{color id="-1"}}attacks, as well as Lady Riju's
{{color id="0"}}lightning{{color id="-1"}}, appear to be very effective
against them.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Rather than relying on the brute force of
swords and spears, we should try to
explore other ways to damage them.
In any case, we learned in the last fight
that they are not unbeatable. That is
enough to give us hope.

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Very well.{{delay8}} In that case, please report to
Lady Riju.

When the battle begins, I will be focused
on protecting her. For the {{color id="0"}}sake{{color id="-1"}} of the
Gerudo, nothing can happen to {{color id="0"}}her{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{anim type="Determination_00"}}I will be in overall command here. Mark
targets with your arrows and I will unleash
my lightning on them!
What's more, my control over my lightning
continues to improve—with time to charge
up, I can hit distant targets!

---
label: Talk_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="WeaponSwingS_01"}}Link! When the hives open up to release
more Gibdos, fire arrows at them. I'll
strike with my lightning when you do!

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="WeaponSwingS_01"}}That's all the hives! Excellent! Now take
out any remaining monsters!

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Work"}}I will keep Lady Riju safe! You deal with
the Gibdo hives!

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Let's wipe out every last Gibdo!

---
label: Talk_43

{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}What are you thinking dressing that way
at a time like this?!

---
label: Talk_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What are you...{{delay15}} You should be wearing
something during battle!

---
label: Talk_57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}I wouldn't recommend dressing as an
enemy of the Gerudo. Don't be surprised
if someone comes after you!

---
label: Talk_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Is that really how you're going into battle?


You might consider wearing armor of
some kind, but it is your decision...

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The writing on it says...


"Standing back-to-back with the throne,
witness red pillars across a vast sea.

"Unite the pillars in light to reveal the
lightning stone and open the way.

"You who can hear my voice, come to me.
I await you."

Red pillars and light...

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Sarqso for your help against the Gibdos.
There are spoils from the battle in the
courtyard—use them as you wish.
If you are looking for Lady Riju, she said
something about the mural in the shelter
and set off in that direction.

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Help yourself to the spoils from the battle.


If you are looking for Lady Riju, I believe
she is at the mural in the shelter.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The sand shroud makes it impossible to
explore the Gerudo Desert, except maybe
if you could soar in the sky like a Rito...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Where did Zelda go?

---
label: Near_42
---
Where did Zelda go...

---
label: Talk_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Lady Riju should be at the mural in the
shelter. Last I saw her, she seemed a
bit preoccupied.

---
label: Talk_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_00"}}Lady Riju said that she spotted a light out
in the sand shroud and quickly departed.
She didn't take anyone with her...
I'm glad the chief does not possess an
overly cautious nature, but at times
she can be a bit reckless.
Could you find her? I would feel better
knowing you were there if she needed
any help.

label: Talk_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_00"}}The monster fled up to the top
of the temple.

So how do we get up there?

---
label: Near_02
---
What is this place...

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand"}}Aha! We've charged all of the batteries!


Come on, Link. Let's check out
the device!

---
label: Near_03
---
So, does this activate it?

---
label: Near_04
---
What is that?

---
label: Talk_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hmm. You appear to lack a bow of
any kind...

---
label: Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hmm. You don't have any arrows...

---
label: Talk_54
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}Hmm. You don't have a bow, and even if
you did, you don't have any arrows to
shoot from it...

---
label: Talk_52
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Speak with that soldier over there. {{delay8}}She is
responsible for managing the weapons.

---
label: Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[13,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}OK, Link! We need to get to the very top!


To start, we should do what that
mysterious voice suggested and try
to find those four battery devices...
