That sure was a brush with death.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Honestly...I feel myself on the verge of

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}You and I met back in Tarrey Town, didn't
we?{{delay8}} In front of that {{color id="0"}}thing that dispensed
Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}?
I'm pretty sure I saw you put stuff into
that machine and get Zonai devices out...

---
label: GoodBye00_01a
---
There's one east of here in {{color id="0"}}Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}}, so I was thinking I might go to
investigate further.

---
label: GoodBye00_01b
---
There's something similar at {{color id="0"}}Digdogg
Suspension Bridge {{color id="-1"}}to the southwest, so
I thought I might go investigate.

label: GoodBye00_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}If you're so inclined, you might want to
go take a look yourself!{{pageBreak}}You never know, it might contain different
{{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}} than the Tarrey Town one.

---
label: After00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You're the one who got those {{color id="0"}}Zonai
devices {{color id="-1"}}out of that gadget in Tarrey
Town, right?

---
label: GoodBye01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}As ever, I'm studying those strange
machines that dispense {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk00_00

It seems like the way to actually get
Zonai devices out of them is to {{color id="0"}}put in
something related to Zonai civilization{{color id="-1"}}.
{{anim type="Happy_01"}}You'll get {{color id="0"}}something different every time{{color id="-1"}}
too, so you should try putting different
things in to see what will come out!

---
label: Talk01_00

I'm sure you know that Zonai devices will
pop out when you put in stuff related to
Zonai civilization...
But did you know that the number of
devices you'll get varies based on how
much stuff you toss in there?
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}You should have seen my face when I
put in {{color id="0"}}a bunch of those sparkling things{{color id="-1"}},
only to be met with a torrent of devices!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}In my book, that's proof positive that
those sparkly things contain an incredible
amount of power.
Should you find yourself in want of Zonai
devices, I recommend you give it a try.

I'm sure you know that Zonai devices will
pop out when you put in things tied to
Zonai civilization...
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}But I was certainly surprised when I put in
{{color id="0"}}a bunch of those sparkling things{{color id="-1"}} and
received a torrent of devices in return!
In my book, that's proof positive that
those sparkly things contain an incredible
amount of power!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}It seems my hypothesis was correct! The
machines in different locations do indeed
dispense different {{color id="0"}}Zonai devices{{color id="-1"}}!
In other words, if you're after a specific
Zonai device, you'll need to {{color id="0"}}choose your
dispenser carefully{{color id="-1"}}.
So each time I want to research a
different Zonai device, I need to head
to a different location.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}I would normally recommend that you
make note of where you can get your
preferred Zonai devices...
But you look like the sort who already
marks that type of info on his map.

{{delay15}}I'll let you know how my research is
proceeding when we meet again!
