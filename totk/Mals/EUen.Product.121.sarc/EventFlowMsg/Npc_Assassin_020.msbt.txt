Out of brightbloom seeds...

---
label: talk_1000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I used up all the {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}} I
brought with me.{{delay8}} If you have any extra,
would you mind sharing?

---
label: talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}You can't get through here without
{{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay8}}and I used all of
mine up.
I'm sorry to ask, but if you have any on
hand, would you mind sharing?

Here you go.

Sorry, can't help you.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah! Thank you!

label: talk_1011

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Phew... You really saved me.


It's so dark around here, you can't see a
thing without a little glow. {{delay8}}So don't waste
your {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}} like I did!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, and putting a seed on the ground to
hit it is all right,{{delay8}} but expert explorers
{{color id="0"}}attach them to arrows and fire them{{color id="-1"}}.
Do that, and look—{{delay8}}I can see your face in
the dark, clear as day!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The face of our sworn enemy Link, that is!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}You're just going to leave me in the dark?
That's low, even for you.

label: talk_1031
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}You don't have any, after all...


Getting my hopes up just to dash them?
I can't think of anything crueler.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Talk about a heartless hero!

label: talk_1041

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hello there.{{delay8}} Did they send you to
explore the Depths too? Do you have
enough {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}}?
Many of our allies are using these Zonai
devices called "lights" lately,{{delay8}} but it never
hurts to have {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seeds{{color id="-1"}} on hand.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}You never know when a light will go out
on you, after all.

---
label: talk_1042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Many in our clan choose to navigate the
Depths with those Zonai lights,{{delay8}} but I'll
take a {{color id="0"}}brightbloom seed {{color id="-1"}}any day.
You never know when a light might fail,
but you can always count on a seed.
