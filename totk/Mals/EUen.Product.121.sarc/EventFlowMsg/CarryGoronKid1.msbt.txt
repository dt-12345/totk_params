{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Pretty sure someone said you can get to
{{color id="0"}}the end of the tracks {{color id="-1"}}if you get in this
{{color id="0"}}mine cart{{color id="-1"}}...
But...how do you make it move?!


I bet the ancient city of {{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}} is
over there.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa, hey! Who are you, guy?{{delay8}} Me? I'm
not doing nothin'.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Well...if you're wondering, Gorondia{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}is the
legendary place where the {{color id="0"}}Gorons of old{{color id="-1"}}
used to live.
I heard there's an amazing treasure
stored there too. They had even more
advanced technology than we do now!
And I heard they used to ride in
{{color id="0"}}strange vehicles{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}I wanted to use this {{color id="0"}}mine cart{{color id="-1"}} to search
for the treasure, but...I can't get it
to budge.
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}Anyway, you better not tell anyone all my
secrets, OK?

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}, where the {{color id="0"}}Gorons of old {{color id="-1"}}lived...


I'm gonna sneak over there real quiet-like
and find that treasure!

I just need to get this {{color id="0"}}mine cart {{color id="-1"}}moving
somehow so I can {{color id="0"}}get to the end of
the tracks{{color id="-1"}}...
{{delay8}}Huh?

---
label: Talk16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Whoa, hey! Who are you, guy?{{delay8}} You really
scared me!

For a second, I thought maybe you'd
overheard my big secret.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I just know that {{color id="0"}}Gorondia {{color id="-1"}}is down the tracks...


There are monsters around, so I can't walk there.
How am I supposed to get this {{color id="0"}}mine cart{{color id="-1"}} going?{{size value="100"}}
