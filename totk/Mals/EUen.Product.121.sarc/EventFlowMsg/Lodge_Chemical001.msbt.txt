{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Wh-what are you talkin' about?! Don't
you hear those monsters?! I sure do!

Whatever you do, don't open the door
{{color id="0"}}if you can hear the sound of monsters{{color id="-1"}}!

label: Talk_01

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Wh-what are you saying?! Why would
anyone help us? This place is crawling
with monsters!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Huh? The{{color id="0"}} monsters{{color id="-1"}}... I can't hear
them anymore!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Come on, Jogo! What's takin' you
so long?!

Quick! You gotta unlock the door!

label: Talk_07
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks for helping us!{{size value="100"}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We took a break in this here vacant house
to {{color id="0"}}get away from the cold{{color id="-1"}}, and before we
knew it, monsters had us surrounded.

---
label: Talk_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, you should be sure to thank him
nice 'n' proper like.

---
label: Talk_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I still can't believe you came to help us.
You really did save us, you know.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Ever since {{color id="0"}}the Upheaval{{color id="-1"}}, there've been
more and more monsters. We were trying
to be careful, but...

---
label: Talk_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I don't know how to thank you enough,
but please, take this...

---
label: Talk_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}Ah, hold on! You're lugging around too
much stuff already, aren't ya?{{pageBreak}}I was going to give you a spicy elixir
as a little thank-you gift.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}But I'll wait until you've cleared out some
room for it.

---
label: Talk_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was planning to give you a spicy elixir as
a little thank-you gift for saving us...

But it looks like you're already carrying
as much as you can carry. So, lemme
know when you lighten your load, OK?
Oh, uh...or did you want to ask me
something about {{color id="0"}}shield surfing{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Looks like you've finally got some room
to carry stuff.{{pageBreak}}So here ya go...{{delay8}} Just a little gift to say
thanks for saving us!

---
label: Talk_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ah, but it doesn't feel like it's thanks
enough. Not for someone who saved
our lives...

---
label: Talk_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, hey, I got an idea! {{delay8}}Mister, do you
know anything about {{color id="0"}}shield surfing{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: 0000
---
No. What is it?

---
label: Talk_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Shield surfing is a way of gettin' around
by ridin' and slidin' on a {{color id="0"}}shield{{color id="-1"}}.

First you hold up a shield, then you {{color id="0"}}jump{{color id="-1"}}
on it and ride!

But you gotta {{color id="0"}}get some momentum going{{color id="-1"}}
or it won't work. It can be kinda tricky
like that.

---
label: 0001
---
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

---
label: Talk_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Of course you are! You hauled yourself to
a place covered in snow, so you gotta
know a thing or two about shield surfing!
Anyhoo, just remember, after you get the
shield into position, all ya gotta do is
jump on it and ride.
But of course, there'll be no surfin' for
you if you don't {{color id="0"}}get some momentum{{color id="-1"}}
goin'. It's kinda tricky like that, eh?

---
label: Talk_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, that's right...

---
label: Talk_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you like that {{color id="0"}}shield{{color id="-1"}} over yonder, go
right ahead and use it. We brought plenty
of our own.

---
label: Talk_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I may not look like it, but I used to be a
professional shield surfer, ya know.

I heard a rumor there was this {{color id="0"}}legendary
surfer{{color id="-1"}} somewhere in the {{color id="0"}}Hebra Mountains{{color id="-1"}},
so I came here lookin' for 'em.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But, well, I didn't know their exact
location. Worse yet, I took a break here
and ended up surrounded by monsters.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, but if you need to know anything
about {{color id="0"}}shield surfing{{color id="-1"}}, at least I can help
with that.
Anything you don't understand about it,
just go ahead and ask me!

---
label: Talk_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Gaaah! What should we do?! We can't
go outside with all these {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}}
everywhere!

---
label: Talk_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare"}}Wh-what do we do?


We've got shields for shield surfing
and {{color id="0"}}spicy elixirs{{color id="-1"}} to resist the cold...
and that's it!
If {{color id="0"}}monsters {{color id="-1"}}attack, we aren't gonna make
it are we?

---
label: Talk_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}All we did was take a little break in here.
And now this! I can't believe the trouble
we're in.
*sigh* I wonder if the {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} will,
I don't know, maybe just go somewhere
else soon.

---
label: Talk_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Will we have to hide here for the rest of
our lives? It'll be just the two of us,
locked in here forever at this rate.

---
label: Talk_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}H-hey... It seems like it got quiet out
there all of a sudden.

---
label: Talk_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Yammo...the truth is...we ran out of
the ingredients we need to make
{{color id="0"}}spicy elixirs{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}But the cold won't matter if we snuggle
up together.

Our love will melt the ice! Hehehe, um,
just kidding!

---
label: Talk_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You kiddin' me? The power of love is no
match for this kinda cold!

At this rate, we're gonna freeze to death
before we get to meet the {{color id="0"}}legendary
shield surfer{{color id="-1"}}.
Come on, can't you catch us a
{{color id="0"}}summerwing butterfly{{color id="-1"}} so we can
make a {{color id="0"}}spicy elixir{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Talk_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Yammo... I... *sigh* Even my heart is
cold now.

---
label: Talk_31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Wh-what are you talking about?! I still
hear {{color id="0"}}monsters{{color id="-1"}} out there, don't you?!

You took too long gettin' ready, and
now we're surrounded again!

---
label: Talk_32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I-I said I'm sorry...{{pageBreak}}You know, we really should have brought
a weapon with us, not just a shield.

---
label: Talk_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_00"}}Look...{{color id="0"}}as long as you can hear monsters{{color id="-1"}}
out there, you don't open that door,
ya hear?

---
label: Talk_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}Yammo! I think there's someone outside!
Maybe that person came back to save us!
