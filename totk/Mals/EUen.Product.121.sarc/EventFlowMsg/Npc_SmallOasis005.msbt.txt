{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Um, uh... You do know the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}
makes compasses stop working, right?

You're not really thinking about trying to
push your way through it...{{delay15}}are you?

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}H-hey... I'm sure you know, but out in the
{{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, even the fanciest compasses
will just stop working.
So if you're thinking about trying to brute
force your way through it...don't!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}It's even more dangerous right now in the
cold of the night! Just don't do it!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}It took years and years of regular visits,
but we've finally started to convince the
Gerudo that they can depend on us.
So please, I'm begging you, don't ruin it
by causing any trouble or being reckless.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* Now that we've got Ponthos back,
I just want to hurry up and get out of
here. Doesn't matter where we go next...
Everything was fine until we were given
guard duty. We just had to be the first to
flee when the monsters appeared...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The soldier ladies' stares are so cold...


Ugh... I want to find a hole to hide in...

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}*sigh* Why did we run away like cowards?
No, I guess anyone would run away from
an attack like that...
Ugh. I still want to find a hole to hide in.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Speaking of, Ponthos said he fell into a hole when he
ran through the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}... Maybe I should throw
caution to the wind and jump into a {{color id="0"}}sinkhole{{color id="-1"}} too...{{size value="100"}}
