{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{playSound id="90" otherArg="0x0000"}}I seeee. So, to summarize...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_53
---
There's no mistaking that what you all
saw at the castle was the Demon King
from the legend of the Imprisoning War.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_52
---
{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious"}}And the princess you've been seeing
was actually an impostor!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}And the reason she appeared at Hyrule
Castle was so the Demon King could lure
Link into a trap...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[2,0]"}}{{anim type="TuliHowl_00"}}I knew something seemed weird!{{pageBreak}}I mean, about Princess Zelda not doing
anything to help with these troubles
everywhere in Hyrule.{{pageBreak}}But it's all connected—the Upheaval, the
problems our homelands have been
facing, the fake princess.{{pageBreak}}It's all happening because the Demon
King came back!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}So, then, that means that Princess Zelda
isn't actually here?

Instead, she's in the distant past and not
in the present... Right?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Yes, we should consider that to be the
case, bizarre as it sounds.

It also seems that Princess Zelda was
trying to somehow defeat the Demon
King in the past...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Our ancestors made a vow to Zelda...


They swore that when the Demon King
was revived, their descendants would
awaken as sages and fight alongside Link.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="TuliDepressed_00"}}But with Princess Zelda in the past, we
can't ask her what the plan is supposed
to be.{{pageBreak}}And she can't be here to fight with
us either...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Trouble_01"}}We also don't know anything about the
Demon King other than the fact that he's
bad news and super strong.
What do we do...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Hmm. Based on what you each have
told me...{{delay15}}

It appears the princess was making
preparations in anticipation of the
Demon King's revival in this era.
There must be some hint we still haven't
figured out here in our time.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Right you are!


We cannot afford to stand still at a time
such as this. It is imperative that we act!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Hmm. But without any leads...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh! Wait...{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}You said that six sages were with King
Rauru when he fought against the Demon
King during the Imprisoning War, right?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_09
---
Wind...

---

---
Fire...

Water...

---
Lightning...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And time... That was the princess.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oooh!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}I see!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What is it? What do you see?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}That's it!


There was one more sage back then!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Exactly!


One more sage that might be here now!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm sure this is the lead we were hoping
for. {{delay15}}It will be well worth our while
to search!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Each of you awakened as sages at ruins
from the age of legends, right?

Maybe the remaining sage is in a
similar location.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}That makes sense. So we should search
major ruins from the age of legends...

They're as good a place as any to start.
If we just searched all of Hyrule randomly,
we'd probably never find the sage.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}All right! We have a plan. Let's split up
the work and get to it!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_54
---
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You four go back to your homelands and
gather information about ruins that might
be related to the remaining sage.
Linky, search around and see if you can
find any other undiscovered leads!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_51
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}Everyone's relying on you! Don't let
us down!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_56
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? You've already found a clue about
the fifth sage?

Sage Mineru? And...Zonai Ruins in Faron?


Why didn't you mention that sooner!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_57
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}The Zonai Ruins in Faron, huh...


It's likely that there are ruins from the
age of legends in that region as well.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_58
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oooh. So then, the fifth sage must
be there!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_59
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}The path forward seems clear.


Linky, we'll leave it to you. You should
head for the Zonai Ruins in Faron
and investigate!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The rest of you should head to your
villages to gather information and prepare
for the final battle.{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_67
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's up to all of you!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_72
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}An island floating in the sky, and Zonai
ruins in the Depths...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_73
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}And if you do what the voice says,
then you'll be able to meet the fifth
sage, yeah?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_74
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Now that we've got all this information,
the path forward is clear.

I'll leave taking care of Sage Mineru to
you, Link!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? You...already found her? Mineru?
{{delay15}}The Sage of Spirit!

Why didn't you mention that sooner!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Admiration_00"}}Heh, I don't know what else to say except
well done!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Still, if what this Sage Mineru says is true,
then everything Zelda was trying to do in
the past...
It was all in order to heal and strengthen
the Master Sword, which will be critical
to defeating the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_64
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}So Princess Zelda was in the distant past
all alone, doing everything she could to
help us.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_41
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}And she sent a message to Link to visit
the Deku Tree...

Then our first Master Sword clue lies with
the Deku Tree.

Princess Zelda sacrificed herself to
restore this sword for the sake of Link
and everyone else in this era.
It is the key to defeating the Demon King.
We must find it at all costs!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_49
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}The Deku Tree should be in Korok Forest,
which is in the Great Hyrule Forest.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_42
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That's right. It's clear what we need to
do now.

Link, head for the Deku Tree, and search
for the Master Sword!{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_62
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Everyone else, return home and prepare
for the final battle.{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_68
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The princess has placed her hope in us.
We can't let it be for nothing.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay15}}You already found her?{{delay8}} Mineru?
{{delay15}}The Sage of Spirit!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}AND you have the{{delay15}} Master Sword already?
{{delay15}}Why didn't you mention that sooner!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Didn't you say the Master Sword
disappeared?

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_40
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}Heh, I don't know what else to say
except well done!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}It is amazing that even trapped in the
past like she was, Zelda still had a plan.

Everything she did was to heal and
strengthen the Master Sword, which will
be critical to defeating the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}So Princess Zelda was in the distant past
all alone, doing everything she could to
help us.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I cannot fathom the sheer strength of will
that must have required...

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}...{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_75
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_01"}}It's a heavy burden that you've taken
on, Link...to finish what Princess
Zelda started.
Now, after everything she's done, the
rest is up to us.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_44
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}With everything in order, all that's left to
do now is defeat the Demon King!

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_50
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Link, whenever you want to face this is
up to you. You're critical in all of this, so
when you're ready, we will be too.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_48
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="PurahTalkSerious_00"}}Everyone, hurry back to your homes and
prepare for the final battle. I'll sound the
alarms once Link is ready.

---
label: Dm_ZN_0002_04_69
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Princess Zelda entrusted her hope to us.
Together, we will see this through.
