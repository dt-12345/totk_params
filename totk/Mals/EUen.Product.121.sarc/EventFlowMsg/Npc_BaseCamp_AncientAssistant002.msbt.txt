Ugh, it's cold...

Fascinating...

Is it true?

There's something here...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hmm?{{delay15}} Oh...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry, didn't see you there. I was pretty
deep in thought about these ruins.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hi there.


I was captivated by the sight of the ruins
in the gentle morning light.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hi there.


I was captivated by the sight of the ruins

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hi there.


I was captivated by the sight of the ruins

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hi there.


I was captivated by the sight of the ruins

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hi there.


I was captivated by the sight of the ruins

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}These ruins are very unusual.


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}They're unique among all the ruins that
our survey team has discovered. On the
surface, at least.
We need to investigate it fully, but most
of the team is at the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}. We're
stretched thin these days.
We'll have to make do. The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
are {{color id="0"}}very important{{color id="-1"}}, after all.

label: Talk_37

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You sure are interested in this ruin,
aren't you?

Well, right now, most of the survey team
is far away at the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The whole team is stretched thin, so our
research here is slower than I'd like.

We'll have to make do. The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
are {{color id="0"}}very important{{color id="-1"}}, after all.

Ring Ruins?

label: Talk_33

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}See those ruins over yonder? Those are
the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}—at least the ones we can
see from here. Impressive, right?
But the ones here are important too.
Unique among all the ruins!

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Still, ever since the Zonai Survey Team
found {{color id="0"}}stone slabs inscribed with Zonai
text{{color id="-1"}} at the Ring Ruins...
our leader has been spending all of his
time there, and he took most of the team
with him.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those ruins fell all over {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}.


The village used to be a quiet place,
and kind of isolated up in the mountains.
Almost a secret in some ways.
That's all changed. It's far busier now.
All sorts of people go there to see
what's happened.

label: Talk_34

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Those ruins fell all over {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}},
far off in the Necluda region to the
southeast.
They're called the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} because,
well, they're still partially intact and are
in the shape of rings.
You can't see them from here, but climb
up high at Lookout Landing and you
can make them out on the horizon.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But these ruins here are special too.
Truly unique...

Still, the Ring Ruins hold something
mysterious that's got the attention of
the Zonai Survey Team's leader.
He's there looking into {{color id="0"}}stone slabs
inscribed with Zonai text{{color id="-1"}}, and he took
most of our team with him.

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Though, I guess I'm lucky that I get to investigate

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I was prepared for plenty of danger when
I joined the Zonai Survey Team.

But that doesn't mean that scary things
aren't still scary, you know?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Even if people saw someone at the castle,
I kind of doubt it was Princess Zelda...

Unfortunately, it's too far to see from
here.{{delay15}} You'd probably need a telescope
to get a good look, really.
