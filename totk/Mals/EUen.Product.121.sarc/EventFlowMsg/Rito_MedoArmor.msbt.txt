{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, Link! {{delay15}}Thanks to you, life in Rito
Village is slowly getting back to normal.{{pageBreak}}I've been looking into leads about
Princess Zelda, and I'll let you know right
away if any of them go somewhere!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Oh, yeah, one other thing! {{delay15}}I don't think
this has anything to do with where the
princess went, but...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hey, Link! {{delay15}}Life in Rito Village is just about
back to normal now.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Who could have guessed that the blizzard
that hit Rito Village was the work of the
Demon King?{{pageBreak}}Or that Princess Zelda was sent to the
world of the past? No wonder we couldn't
find her.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}The big thing left to do now is to round
up all the information we can find on
{{color id="0"}}the fifth sage{{color id="-1"}}.
I'll do my part to turn up whatever I can
about ruins from the age of legends!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Harth asked me to help him sort through
some ancient literature.{{pageBreak}}You'll never believe what I found written
in one of his books!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}"Sturnida, {{delay8}}Goflam's, {{delay8}}and Sherfin's. {{delay15}}Hidden
treasure sleeps in the center of the three

When it fills, {{delay8}}the slumbering treasure
will awaken once more."{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}There's got to be something good waiting
for whoever solves the riddle, right?!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Secret hot springs, huh? I've been to
{{color id="0"}}Sturnida Secret Hot Spring{{color id="-1"}} a few times.
It's northwest of Rito Village.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}It's the best! A quick soak is enough to
heal your wounds in the blink of an eye.
It keeps you from freezing too.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But I dunno about the others. The Hebra
Mountains are a big place. I'm not sure
we could cover all of them.{{pageBreak}}But that slumbering treasure is pretty
tempting...{{delay8}}if only we could find it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I know about the {{color id="0"}}Sturnida secret hot

it be?
