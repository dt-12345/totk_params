{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It was frightening when the sludge started
falling, but at least the front of the store
is clean.
You see, {{delay8}}Cleff used the splash fruit {{delay8}}to
clean everything up...just in front of
the store.
{{anim type="Ease_00"}}That's right. {{delay8}}He used all the splash fruit
that the store had in stock,{{delay8}} and made it
sooo clean...just in front of the store.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}W-well, safety comes first!


{{anim type="Tired_00"}}{{size value="80"}}And I must admit...{{delay8}}I was acting out of fear.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Cleff used ALL of our splash fruit {{delay8}}and
made it sooo clean...just in front of
the store.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sigh"}}Well, safety comes first! Heh...{{delay15}} *sigh*

label: talk0050
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thanks for cleaning up the statue in
the square.

I will make note of your achievement and
report it to Lady Yona.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh... {{delay15}}I suppose I should record Cleff's
achievement as well.

---
label: talk0051
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat"}}Yes, {{delay8}}please note that I tackled the sludge
for the sake of my beloved domain.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}However... {{delay8}}Please do not mention that I accidentally
used up all of the splash fruit I was selling...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I will make note of your achievement and

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I must look into these documents...

---
label: talk0025
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}This document appears to be
relatively recent.

I must examine older texts if I hope to
find information on the sky land that
Prince Sidon is looking for. 

---
label: talk0047
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}The information regarding the sky that
Prince Sidon is looking for...

No... This won't help either.

label: near0009

This book!

---
label: talk0027
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}This appears to be a record of the royal
family that is fairly old...

However, we can safely assume that
anything about the connection between
the Zora and the sky would be far older.
The ruins that {{color id="0"}}Jiahto {{color id="-1"}}is looking into
are surely the big catch.

---
label: talk0048
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I went through most of the books in the
domain. Still...

I can't seem to find the information about
the sky that Prince Sidon is looking for.

I believe our best bet{{delay15}} lies in the ruins that
{{color id="0"}}Jiahto {{color id="-1"}}is investigating...

---
label: 0000
---
Where's Jiahto?

---
label: 0001
---
Goodbye.

---
label: talk0028
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Jiahto is on the cliff behind the domain.{{delay8}}
He is on the banks of {{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}.

The Upheaval revealed an old ruin, and so
he is investigating it.

It seems Prince Sidon believes that ruin
is the most promising of our prospects.{{delay15}}
Yes...{{delay8}} I can't help but agree.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If I don't find anything after a bit more
investigating, perhaps I'll join Jiahto...

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}If I am unable to find anything here,
perhaps I should join up with Jiahto.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}So much has happened that planning for
the new Zora history chronicle is a lot
of work.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}The sludge has disappeared, and a new
king has taken the throne!

A wonderful new page has been added to
the history of the Zora!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I wish that you could stay forever in our
beautiful domain, Link.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}But as I understand it, you must
be leaving.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}If you ever grow weary during your
journey, {{delay8}}please return to Zora's Domain.
You are always welcome here!

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Once the sludge disappeared, the ancient
ruins were revealed to be majestically
floating in the sky.
It is like a divine gift to the Zora.{{delay15}} I believe
the message they are sending us is...

{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}When you are in turmoil, do not get lost
gazing down into the watery depths,
but rather set your sights skyward.

---
label: talk0035
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Link...{{delay8}} I pray that your travels are safe.

---
label: talk0055

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Ancient ruins floating in the sky...{{delay15}}
It is so very mystical, is it not?

---
label: talk0056
---
Hm, though the weather is bad right now.
You can hardly see them.

---
label: talk0040
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Next I must examine the ancient books.

---
label: talk0038
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If the phenomena of the world are at rest
now, I would like to go inspect the ruins
in the sky.
Then I might be able to find the evidence
behind this literature. So far, it sounds
like a bunch of fairy tales.

---
label: talk0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Now...{{delay8}} I must do my resource hunting
quietly. I do not want to upset Dento.

---
label: talk0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I will take a look at the books from
the inn.

---
label: talk0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}In this shelf, there are texts about
robberies and romances...

Just a bunch of informal literature of
mysterious origins.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughL_01"}}And I must admit...{{delay8}}it is fascinating.

---
label: talk0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The texts on this shelf seem like they are
for travelers looking to kill time.

But not even Kayden knows how long
they have been here.

Some of them are quite old, so I may
make some surprising discoveries.
