{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, just a minute...{{delay8}}


I hear you and the chief worked together
to clear the sand shroud? Is that right?

...I think I was being overly protective of
my daughter before.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Maybe you wouldn't be the worst
influence on her. Perhaps even a
good one.
She's already learned a lot from Ashai's
"{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}" {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}}. I bet she grows up
to be a brilliant beauty—like her mother.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}She's a real hard worker, and I bet she
grows up to be a brilliant beauty—just like
her mother.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You know... {{delay8}}Maybe you wouldn't be the

from Ashai's "{{color id="0"}}Voe and You{{color id="-1"}}" {{color id="0"}}class{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I would bet you anything that she's going

she's so busy lately.
