{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}So, fellow traveler. {{delay8}}What are you
searching for on your journey?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}My passion is finding {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}. They're
enormous pictures that have been drawn
on the ground.
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}When were they drawn, and who by,
and how? The mysteries abound!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}We meet again. {{delay8}}Hello, fellow traveler.{{pageBreak}}As ever, my hunt for {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} continues.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Those giant illustrations boggle the mind.{{delay8}}
Who drew them? When? And perhaps
above all, how?{{delay15}}

label: StartPoint_01

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I tried to learn more about {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}
by asking my associates in the Zonai
Survey Team.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Unfortunately, all they wanted to talk
about was training in their underpants.

label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}My associates in the Zonai Survey Team
had nothing to tell me about {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I hear there's a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph near the
Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}},{{delay8}} which are north of here,
past the Eldin Mountains.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Now that Death Mountain has stopped
erupting, one can travel there freely.

Though that's not to say crossing the
nearby mountains is an easy task.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}There's said to be a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph near the
Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, which are north of here,
past the Eldin Mountains.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}So, fellow traveler. {{delay8}}Taking shelter from
the rain? It's quite the annoyance, I know.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'd heard about a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}in Eldin, and I
was searching for it when the rain stalled
my journey.
Eldin doesn't get much precipitation,{{delay8}}
so we have reason to hope that the
geoglyph there is in good condition.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I'm eager to see it with my own eyes as
soon as possible.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Eldin doesn't get much precipitation,{{delay8}}
so we have reason to hope that the
{{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}there is in good condition.
I'm eager to see it with my own eyes as
soon as possible.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I heard tell of a {{color id="0"}}geoglyph {{color id="-1"}}in this area,
but it refuses to show itself.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Not for the first time, I'm wishing I had
wings like a bird. Then I could scout it out
{{color id="0"}}from the sky{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoRange_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}If I had wings like a bird, I could probably
scout out the {{color id="0"}}geoglyph{{color id="-1"}} {{color id="0"}}from the sky{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoRange_03

{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}I heard an interesting rumor that there
are not one but two {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} in Eldin.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry_01"}}The first is supposedly on the south side
of the mountain.{{delay8}} Which is to say, {{color id="0"}}nearby{{color id="-1"}}.

The other one, I'm told, is on the
northwest side of the mountain range,{{delay8}}
{{color id="0"}}near the Thyphlo Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Sadly, my search for the geoglyph in this
area has come up empty.

I suppose I'd have better luck if I climbed
a hill and {{color id="0"}}peered down from its summit{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Rumor has it that there are two {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}
in Eldin.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}One is supposedly in {{color id="0"}}this area{{color id="-1"}}, and the
other is said to be on the northwest side

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Was it you who defeated those monsters?{{delay8}}
What a brave soul!

I could do to run for my life...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Were you hurt? {{delay8}}By some miracle,
I was not.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}We must tread lightly. There are bound to
be more monsters about.
