{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Welcome to Hudson Construction.{{pageBreak}}With Mattison off on her own little
adventure, it looks like I can resume
working on dream homes.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}I'm a little uneasy though... There's
some kind of massive sand shroud in
Gerudo Desert right now, after all.
But there's nothing I can do about that!
I'll just keep her home safe until
she returns.
And in the meantime, I need to buckle
down and get to work!

built around {{color id="0"}}supporting{{color id="-1"}} our customers as
they {{color id="0"}}assemble their dream homes{{color id="-1"}}.
Maybe you're thinking a little basic—like
a kitchen. Or a fully furnished room. Or
something more. We're here for you!
Maybe you want to add a nice space to
display some of your favorite pictures. Or
a place to care for your beloved horse.
But that's nothing compared to what's
really important—and what all of our
customers truly enjoy—which is...
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}the opportunity to {{color id="0"}}assemble{{color id="-1"}} all these
individual {{color id="0"}}rooms{{color id="-1"}} on their own!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You pick the rooms you want, and then
you can put them together the way you
always imagined!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}That's the real core of the service
we provide.

We even give a little {{color id="0"}}commemorative gift{{color id="-1"}}
to celebrate starting down the path to
dream-home ownership!
You know, our whole family is in your debt
for all your help with Mattison.

If you're interested in a {{color id="0"}}dream home{{color id="-1"}},
I'll set you up with a {{color id="0"}}discount{{color id="-1"}}! It's my way
of saying sarqso. You know...{{delay8}}thank you.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I'm sorry. I was going to prepare the
