you, Link!
Now then, {{delay15}}please go and see him
right away!

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I am overjoyed to see you alive and well,
Link!{{delay15}} Prince Sidon was beside himself
with worry.
{{size value="80"}}Speaking of overwhelming concern, I wonder how
my daughter, Dunma, is faring. She is remarkably
competent, but I cannot help but worry... Hm... {{size value="100"}}{{delay15}}{{size value="80"}}
{{size value="100"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Please forgive my rudeness.

Prince Sidon?

Goodbye!

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}{{size value="80"}}Oh, oops... I hope you did not hear me talking
to myself.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Well, you see, my daughter, Dunma, was
selected for the ruins-investigation team!
It is quite the honor.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}She is protecting {{color id="0"}}Jiahto{{color id="-1"}} the historian
over at {{color id="0"}}Toto Lake{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay8}}All by her lonesome,
no less!
She earned this honor for her part in
clearing out the sludge in the domain.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}She is practically a child still, not even in
the triple digits, yet look what she has
accomplished.{{delay8}} I am so proud!

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Prince Sidon is busily purifying the water
that was sullied by the sludge. 

It is all thanks to his incredible ability that
the domain has been spared from being
buried by that dreadful stuff.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Yet he is unable to cease his work, lest we
lose our footing and fall to ruin.

If only I had that same power to control
the flow of water, I could be of some use
to our brave prince.

---
label: talk0030
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I hear that he went out on his own to
investigate the sludge and the ruins
that fell from the sky.
That would normally be the work of a
soldier.{{delay15}} I am humbled by his bravery
and devotion.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I am told that while King Dorephan is
away, {{delay8}}the throne room is being used as
a place of refuge for the children to play.
His greatness truly knows no bounds.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Hm.{{delay8}} The land of the sky fish, you say?
I have {{delay8}}not heard of such a thing.{{delay15}}
However...
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Many mysterious islands have appeared in
the sky since the Upheaval.

It is already so unusual, I would not be
surprised if one or two of them had fish.{{delay8}}
Perhaps more!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Or maybe it is not referring to real fish,
but rather something in the {{color id="0"}}shape of
a fish{{color id="-1"}}?
Hmm. {{delay8}}I really haven't the faintest.

---
label: talk0036
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}The land of the sky fish...{{delay15}} I really have no
idea what that could be referring to.

Perhaps somewhere on the mysterious
islands floating in the sky, there is a spot
with lots of fish?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Or maybe that is not referring to real fish,
but rather something in the {{color id="0"}}shape of
a fish{{color id="-1"}}?
Hmm. {{delay8}}I really haven't the faintest.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}With the sludge sullying all of the water it
touches, this is the last remaining source
of clean water for the domain.

---
label: talk0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Look. Can you see it?{{delay8}} That promontory...
{{delay8}}Our statue of Mipha, the Zora Champion,
is there.
That's why it is called Mipha Court.


Please, protect us in our time of need...{{delay15}}
That is the prayer that my heart extends
in the presence of Mipha's statue.

label: talk0016

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Prince Sidon cannot move from this place.


But worry not. I swear I will protect him.

label: talk0045

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Oh, it seems I got a little carried away
chatting with you. I will return to guarding
Prince Sidon shortly.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Our prince cannot leave this place, but
worry not! {{delay8}}I swear that I will protect him
with my very life.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}It's dark now. {{delay8}}Please be careful out on
the road.

As late as it is, Prince Sidon is still
working diligently.{{delay15}} I am so grateful

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}It has been some time since I have seen
Prince Sidon and Lady Yona chatting.

They make such a handsome couple!

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Huh. It almost looks like they are having

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you, Link!


Because of you, Prince Sidon was able to
further his investigation!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}I will not drop my guard just yet, {{delay8}}but I
know in my heart that the future of the
Zora is bright!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I am certain that Mipha is relieved as
well, even as she looks down upon us
from her statue on the promontory.
I think I'll go up there later to give my
thanks to her.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I'm sure that the statue of Mipha on the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Furthermore, although this is admittedly
more of a personal matter...

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}my daughter, Dunma, did a fantastic job
