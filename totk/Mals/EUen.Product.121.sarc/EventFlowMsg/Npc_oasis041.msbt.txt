{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Captain Liana was talking about attaching
an {{color id="0"}}electricity-emitting material{{color id="-1"}}, but...

Honestly, I think attaching something like
a {{color id="0"}}horn from a Fire-Breath Lizalfos{{color id="-1"}} is
better, at least on a sword or knife.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Since I'm not using a spear, I have to get
in close to attack. At first I figured it'd
be too dangerous, but with this {{color id="0"}}shield{{color id="-1"}}...
Well, I didn't think a combination of sword
and shield would work so well!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha! Did you see my swordsmanship?


I had thought that nothing could ever
beat a spear, but now that I've used a
sword and shield... I'm a little torn!
What other weapons are out there that
I've just dismissed out of hand?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The battle definitely taught me how
important it is to learn about the many
different weapons in the world.
You really made good use of your bow, for
example. {{delay15}}As soon as I've mastered the
sword and shield, maybe I'll try that...
