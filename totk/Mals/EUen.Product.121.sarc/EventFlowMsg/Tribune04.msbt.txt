I hear the chirps...

---
label: Talk_Ready_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I've been hearing some chirps and
warbles from my little birds.

They say some regular guests of this
stable are late to arrive—very late.

{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}The chef here, {{color id="0"}}Gotter{{color id="-1"}}, was going to meet
with them to learn a new recipe, one that
{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} taught them.

---
label: Talk_Ready_1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Hmm, my keen reporter instincts say
something is wrong here...

---
label: Talk_Ready_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}This rain is the perfect setting for a prime
story. My keen reporter instincts won't let
me leave this alone...

---
label: Talk_Ready_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}There's no time to sleep when a mystery
like this is aloft. My keen reporter
instincts won't let me leave this alone...

---
label: Talk_Ready_1002
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Gotter {{color id="-1"}}has been over there waiting for the
guests to arrive. He's barely moved this
whole time.

---
label: Talk_Ready_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Let's see...


It's not unusual for guests to decide not
to show up, right?{{delay8}} But what if they're
{{delay8}}unable{{delay8}} to?
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}They were coming to share a recipe from Princess
Zelda too. Hmm, that could be part of this.{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}These chirps and warbles are worth
looking into.

---
label: Near_Ready_1002
---
Huh... So things are fine?

---
label: Talk_Ready_1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd just heard through my little birds that
there was an issue at this stable.

They said some regular visitors to the
stable were well past when they should
have arrived.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But apparently it was a whole lot of
nothing? The guests arrived safely some
time ago!
The chef here, {{color id="0"}}Gotter{{color id="-1"}}, had made an
appointment with the missing guests.

He arranged for them to come and share
a recipe they learned from {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.

My keen reporter instincts made me think
something might have been preventing
them from arriving...

---
label: Near_Search_2001
---
No sign of them.

---
label: Talk_Search_2001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Something isn't right. {{color id="0"}}Agus and the rest{{color id="-1"}}
would have to cross that bridge to get
here, but...

---
label: Talk_Search_2012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{color id="0"}}Agus and the rest {{color id="-1"}}were excited to come
share the recipe that Princess Zelda
taught them...
What could have happened to delay them
like this?

---
label: 0001
---
What's going on?

---
label: 0006
---
Agus and the rest?

---
label: Talk_Search_2011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Oh! I didn't notice you there.{{delay8}} Are you
a customer? If you're looking for stable
services, head over to the counter.

---
label: Talk_Search_2006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm waiting here to greet some guests we
were expecting.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But it's well past when they said they'd
be arriving. {{delay8}}I'm extremely worried.

---
label: Talk_Search_2010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They've always crossed {{color id="0"}}Owlan Bridge{{color id="-1"}} in
the past when they were coming here.

I figured if I kept an eye on the bridge,
I'd catch sight of them eventually.

---
label: Talk_Search_2003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}The guests are all gourmets. Their leader,
a chef named {{color id="0"}}Agus{{color id="-1"}}, has taught me a lot
about cooking.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}They were all excited to visit, and I was
looking forward to it. They have {{color id="0"}}a recipe
from Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}to share.

---
label: 0002
---
Hmm...

---
label: Talk_Search_2009
---
{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}{{color id="-1"}}Maybe they brought tents and decided to
take the trip nice and slow, camping along
the way.

---
label: Talk_Search_2007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Hmm. If Agus and the others have {{color id="0"}}tents{{color id="-1"}},
then they'd be totally fine in this weather.

Still, they haven't shown up yet...{{delay8}} I have
a bad feeling about this.

---
label: Talk_Search_2008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmm. If Agus and the others have {{color id="0"}}tents{{color id="-1"}},
then maybe they're taking the trip nice
and slow, camping along the way.
Still, they haven't shown up yet...{{delay8}} I have
a bad feeling about this.

---
label: Talk_Search_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hmm... So, the gourmets didn't send word
that they weren't coming.

---
label: Talk_Search_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Which means it's more likely that
something—or someone—is keeping
them from getting here.
And they have a recipe that Princess
Zelda taught them. Related?{{delay8}} Maybe,
maybe not.

---
label: Talk_Search_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}As I always say—starting now—leave no
chirps unchecked! No warbles unweighed!{{delay15}}
I'm saying we should look into this!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{1:1 arg="0x9A99193F"}}Ugh... Ohhh... {{delay8}}I think...{{delay8}}animal meat...
Right? {{delay8}}Maybe? {{delay8}}Urk.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{1:1 arg="0x9A99193F"}}Who...who suggested... {{delay8}}Who said...

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}H-hey! You! {{delay8}}Yeah, you! {{delay8}}Can I have that
{{color id="0"}}meat and rice bowl{{color id="-1"}}?

Please! {{delay8}}Please! {{delay8}}I need to eat it!

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}This... I recognize this flavor! Haha!
This is the recipe {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} shared
with us!
Joute! Teli! Endai!{{delay8}} Hurry up and take a
bite of this!

---
label: Talk_Cooking_0001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Oh, thank you for helping us. We were
not doing well at all...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} taught us how to cook
this dish quite some time ago. We ran
into her once during our travels.
She was full of kindness for us,
despite our group being a little
ragged on the road.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}But I do remember now that she said we
needed to {{color id="0"}}follow the recipe exactly{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Ugh! Whose bright idea was it to
substitute {{color id="0"}}monster parts{{color id="-1"}} in place of
real {{color id="0"}}meat{{color id="-1"}}?!

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}That was me. I'm sorry... {{delay8}}I was just
curious what it would taste like.

I thought maybe her recipe would work
well with monster parts.

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The road to gourmet greatness is littered
with stuff you wouldn't think is tasty.{{delay8}}
Gotta expand your palate!

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Now's not the time to sit and figure out
best practices for future dietary exploits!
We've got to get to Riverside Stable!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We're so late... I'm sure Gotter has been
worrying about us.

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}We really are grateful for your help. Let
me say again, on behalf of everyone,{{delay8}}
thank you.
You don't even know us, {{delay8}}but you
used valuable ingredients to save
us from ourselves.
Here, please take this...

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}And this...

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3014

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}And finally...

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, it looks like you're carrying quite a lot
already. Well then, have this instead...

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We like cooking with the very best raw
meat when we have it!

---
label: Talk_Cooking_3012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}You can use all of that to cook yourself
a meat and rice bowl sometime.

Anyway, we'd better get ready and head
to {{color id="0"}}Riverside Stable{{color id="-1"}}, since we planned to
be there...well before now.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I have to get going. Hopefully we'll run
into each other in the future!

---
label: Talk_Report_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Any luck finding those missing travelers
yet? I just started to scout for them from
the sky when I saw you down here!
You chase down any leads at all?

---
label: Talk_Report_1008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What? {{delay15}}They were right here, too queasy
to even move? And you helped them get
back on their feet again?

---
label: Talk_Report_1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}Interesting! So the chirps and warbles
were really onto something.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm impressed that Princess Zelda's vast
knowledge includes things I wouldn't
expect, like recipes for dishes.

---
label: Talk_Report_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}A recipe from Princess Zelda perfect for
getting folks into fighting shape! Ah, the
