Many years ago, in the kingdom of Hyrule's
earliest days...

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_017_b
---
A great evil, the Demon King, sought to conquer the
kingdom and kill everyone who resisted his rule.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_018_b
---
Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—rose up to oppose
him, along with me and five other warriors.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_019_b
---
And to fight the Demon King, Rauru trusted us with
sacred items.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_b
---
Secret stones... Incredible artifacts that amplified our
powers.

label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_c
---
And to fight the Demon King, Rauru trusted us with
secret stones.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_d
---
Incredible artifacts that amplified our powers.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_021_b
---
I stood beside my fellow sages as the Sage of Fire,
stronger than ever with my secret stone.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_022_b
---
However, we were no match for the Demon King.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_023_b
---
Even my strongest blows weren't enough to
break him.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_025_c
---
Rauru understood that we couldn't overcome the
Demon King...

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_026_b
---
In one last brave act, our leader sacrificed himself to
imprison that monster.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_027_b
---
That was the Imprisoning War...

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_029_c
---
The rest of us survived, and it wasn't long after that
climactic battle that someone came to see me. Her
visit would set the Gorons' duty in stone.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_c
---
The Sage of Time—one of the six sages.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_d
---
And then, some time later...

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_e
---
The Sage of Time—one of the six sages—came to me.
Her visit would set the Gorons' duty in stone.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_032_c
---
The magic restraining the Demon King will be undone.
He will return.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_033_c
---
When that time comes, a noble swordsman named
Link will oppose him.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_034_c
---
But Link will need help. Lend him your power...
Your fire... The Goron's mastery of fire!

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_035_b
---
In that moment, the duty of the Goron people
was clear.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_036_c
---
I'd like nothing more than to smash the
Demon King.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_037_b
---
I swear that, when the Demon King returns,
the Sage of Fire will awaken again.

---
label: Dm_GO_0021_Text_038_b
---
The Goron sage and the Goron people will fight
alongside your swordsman.
