{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Don't talk to me again. It could be bad.
Really bad!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}OK, you Gibdo jerks! Do your worst!


I, the incredible Barta, am going to reduce
each and every one of you to dust!

I've been training my body and mind while
we were underground, and I am ready to
wipe you out!

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}What do you want?! I haven't forgotten
the trouble you got me into before!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But... {{delay15}}OK, if you defeat more enemies
than I do during this battle, I could see
my way to forgiving you.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}And I have to admit it—I really, really
enjoyed firing the cannon in the moment.
I've been itching to do it again.

monster's head is always a weak point!

label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hehehe! It looks like you did just about as
well as me and my little friend here.

Since you've been so helpful, I'll let you
fire off a one-cannon salute whenever
you like.

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You've got some nerve just walking up to
me like we're friends! I haven't forgotten

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But... {{delay15}}OK, I'll admit that you really helped
in the battle against the Gibdos.

And besides... I guess I owe you for
making me realize how much I'd enjoy
actually firing this cannon.

{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}I don't want to hear it, Barta!{{size value="100"}}


If that cannon gets fired every time there
is something to celebrate, the town will
be leveled before long!
Until I say otherwise, you are forbidden
from even touching that thing!{{size value="125"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah! Nuh uh, no! That cannon is off-limits.


{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I'm being very, very patient. Just waiting
for the day when I'm allowed to fire that
cannon again.
I can almost smell the smoke now.
Ooo, I'm so excited!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hehehe!{{delay8}} I'm allowed to fire the cannon

fire it...
