{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Ah. {{delay15}}Pardon my rudeness. {{delay8}}Do you require
a raft?{{pageBreak}}The ones by the riverbank are ready
for use.{{delay8}} The {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}} has also

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yes. {{delay8}}This green thing is called a
{{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The one I am inspecting is known as a
{{color id="0"}}fan{{color id="-1"}}. It {{color id="0"}}activates{{color id="-1"}} when {{color id="0"}}struck {{color id="-1"}}to generate
wind on demand.{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Think"}}This river is meltwater. {{delay8}}Falling into it will
quickly sap your stamina.{{pageBreak}}It is for this reason that I maintain rafts
to cross to the other bank.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I should mention that energy is essential
for using a {{color id="0"}}Zonai device{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}You will need an {{color id="0"}}Energy Cell {{color id="-1"}}if you want
to use one.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I see that you already have one. {{delay8}}That is
a relief.{{pageBreak}}Allow me to review how it works.

would be unfortunate to run out mid-use.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}This is a problem. {{delay8}}You do not seem to
