{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Why did you bother coming here in
all this rain? {{delay8}}You that interested in the

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're a curious one, being up here
when everyone's down below.{{delay8}}
The name's Thadd.
I'm from a place that's almost as far
to the {{color id="0"}}southeast{{color id="-1"}} as you can get from
here. It's called {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.
I've been worried about my family back
home. So if you catch me sneaking a
peek thataway, {{delay8}}well, that's why.

I was NOT just gazing off toward my
hometown. Of course not. I'm on the
lookout for monsters.
...


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Problem is, when I keep watch from
here, I see the{{color id="0"}} ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}} in
the distance.
Just so happens that {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}} is
out that way, beyond the horizon.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}My village is indebted to Princess Zelda.


I wanted to offer some kind of assistance
in return, so I came here.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But I'm worried sick about my wife and
son back in {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}...

That's far beyond those {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped
ruins{{color id="-1"}} in the distance, so I keep looking
out that way.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}But I'm keeping proper watch, don't
you worry!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you seen the {{color id="0"}}ring-shaped ruins{{color id="-1"}} on
the horizon? {{delay8}}They're off to the southeast.

But when I'm looking out that way, I'm
thinking of what's beyond the ruins—
my dear {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}.
So, I'm keeping watch for monsters, of
course, but I also keep {{color id="0"}}seeing those
strange ruins{{color id="-1"}}...
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}Which then leads me to worry more about
my family, who I left behind so I could
help out here...
{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}Tamana... Teebo... {{delay8}}Please be all right...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Huh? Just now, I saw something moving
over at Hyrule Castle... Can't be... I must
have imagined it.
