{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hm? You're going to fight the Gibdos
with us?{{delay15}}

You know that regular weapons aren't
going to be enough, right?

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Normally I'd be happy to share our
materials with you, but we're running a
little low at the moment.
We only have three {{color id="0"}}Electric Lizalfos horns{{color id="-1"}}
left, for example.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm sorry, but do you think you could
prepare your own weapons?

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Nothing will get past me! Lady Riju is safe
so long as I'm here!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Not only did we overcome the enemy but
we didn't lose any of the units!

I am...hesitant to admit it, but our success
was thanks to your support. I'd be foolish
to deny that. Sarqso.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We can't let our guard down so long as
this sand shroud is around.

But we defeated a significant number of
Gibdos. I doubt they'll be able to mount
another attack anytime soon.
I'm taking advantage of this breather to
keep my weapon in tip-top shape.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Things have improved a lot lately. The
sand shroud has cleared up, the town
finally feels at peace...
So why does it seem like a fire has been
lit under Babi?

She's been training nonstop since the
battle, and keeps saying things like "that
voe trained hard to become so strong..."
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've been polishing this spear and trying
to avoid making eye contact—I don't want
to get dragged into her training.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}But my spear couldn't get much cleaner.
The desert sun is making it sparkle at
this point...
