We have one here too.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_00"}}Welcome to {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I see it's your first time with us here at
{{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}}, so here you go...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}It's both your first time at {{color id="0"}}East Akkala
Stable{{color id="-1"}} and you've {{color id="0"}}registered a horse{{color id="-1"}},
so here...

---
label: Com_FirstTime_Only03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}You {{color id="0"}}stayed in a regular bed{{color id="-1"}} during your
first visit with us at {{color id="0"}}East Akkala Stable{{color id="-1"}},
so here...

---
label: Goodbye_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Oh, that's right.{{delay8}} Did you meet {{color id="0"}}Malanya{{color id="-1"}}
at Bloodleaf Lake to the north?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I hear that if he takes a liking to you, he
can boost your horse's abilities or even
bring your equine friend back to life!
It sounds far-fetched, but it'd be fantastic
if it's true.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}How lucky would our stable be if a horse
god like that decided to reside here?
I can only imagine!

---
label: BurnedWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Please leave our flower garland alone.
If you really want one...

try picking one up at {{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}
in the mountain range to the southwest
of here.

---
label: DoNotWakka_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You like that, do you? It's nice, isn't it?
I hear they're all the rage right now.

I guess those things got their start in
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. I've been told a little
girl makes them all on her own!
The village is southwest of here in
Necluda, so if you ever pass through,
you should see if you can find one.

---
label: DoNotWakka_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Look, I can see you've taken a liking
to it, but that belongs to the stable, so
it's not yours to have.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}If you want one of your own, just visit
{{color id="0"}}Kakariko Village{{color id="-1"}}. It's southwest of here!

label: Com_Photo_01

{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}So{{delay8}} I did some thinking about what kind of
picture I'd like to hang up.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}There's this big lake right to the {{color id="0"}}south{{color id="-1"}} of
here called {{color id="0"}}Octorok Lake{{color id="-1"}}.

It looks like any other lake at first glance,
but when the {{color id="0"}}water level rises{{color id="-1"}}...it takes
the shape of a monster called an Octorok!
That's how it got its name, I suppose.


{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Anyway, I'd like to paint a {{color id="0"}}picture of
Octorok Lake when it looks like an
Octorok {{color id="-1"}}and hang it on the wall.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}And who knows, with all the monsters
showing up lately, maybe it'll help keep
them away.
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}The thing is,{{delay8}} I can't exactly leave the
stable unattended just to go paint
a picture.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But if I had a picture of {{color id="0"}}Octorok Lake in
its Octorok shape{{color id="-1"}} right in front of me,{{delay8}}
well, {{delay8}}I'm sure I could paint it.

---
label: Com_Photo_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What's that?{{delay8}} You have a {{color id="0"}}picture of
Octorok Lake{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Have you seen how unsettled things are
around here? Monsters are everywhere!

So I came up with this idea... I'll hang up
a {{color id="0"}}picture of Octorok Lake {{color id="-1"}}when it looks
like a monster, and that'll scare them off.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}The lake is south of here, and it looks like
any ol' lake until the {{color id="0"}}water rises{{color id="-1"}}. Then it
takes the{{color id="0"}} shape of an Octorok monster{{color id="-1"}}.
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}The thing is,{{delay8}} it's not a good idea to leave
the stable unattended just to go paint a
picture.{{delay8}} You know?

---
label: Com_Photo_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}If I could hang a {{color id="0"}}picture of Octorok Lake
when it's in the shape of an Octorok{{color id="-1"}}...
I just know it'd help keep monsters away.
Ah, but I don't have time to go all the way
there and paint it. So who knows how
this'll ever get done.

label: 9001
---
Like this one?

---
label: 9002
---
Goodbye.

---
label: 9003
---
I'm not showing you.

---
label: Com_Photo_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS"}}What?{{delay8}} Did you bring me a {{color id="0"}}picture of
Octorok Lake in the shape of an Octorok{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}If {{color id="0"}}Octorok Lake looks like an Octorok
monster {{color id="-1"}}when the water rises...a rainy
day could be a good time to check it out.

---
label: Com_Photo_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}If you happen to have a {{color id="0"}}picture of
Octorok Lake in the shape of an Octorok{{color id="-1"}},
I sure hope you'll show it to me.

---
label: Com_Photo_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Aha! This is just right! Now we'll have a
monster of our own to protect us.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I tell you, I could paint pictures of
{{color id="0"}}Octorok Lake looking like a monster{{color id="-1"}}
all day.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}So, if you have an image of the lake that
you like better, bring it by and I'll use it
as inspiration for a new painting!

---
label: Com_Photo_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I have to say, the lake really does look
like a big monster.

{{anim type="Angry_00"}}The best way to fight monsters is with
your own monsters, right?{{delay8}} Yeah, I just
know this painting is going to protect us!

---
label: Com_Photo_Thank
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Thanks to you, Link, I feel much more
at ease.{{pageBreak}}This intimidating lake will definitely scare
off any monsters that threaten the stable.

---
label: Com_Photo_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Anyway,{{delay8}} is there something you'd like to
do with that {{color id="0"}}picture of Octorok Lake{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: Com_Photo_10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}A painting of a monster-shaped lake!
What a perfect way to ward off monsters!

I'd like to change it.

It's fine the way it is.
