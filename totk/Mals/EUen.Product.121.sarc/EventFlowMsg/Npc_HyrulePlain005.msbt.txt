Well, isn't that fancy?

---
label: BoneHorse
---
What a strange mount.

---
label: LargeHorse
---
It's clearly fond of you.

---
label: GoldHorse
---
What a beautiful creature...

---
label: Near_02

I hope they're all right...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}My, even the rain isn't enough to slow
you down, I see.

---
label: Talk_1020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh, setting out this early, are we?

---
label: Talk_1022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}The monsters are out on the prowl around
now, and you're still setting out?

---
label: Talk_1024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}My, setting out at this hour? Not much of
a sleeper, are you?

---
label: Talk_1021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Oh, do my eyes deceive me? Or do you
plan on setting out?

---
label: Talk_1010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I take it you're {{color id="0"}}also{{color id="-1"}} headed to Goron City.


{{anim type="Sad"}}This may be an odd warning, but do try to
watch out for Gorons with {{color id="0"}}strange rocks{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_1011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You look like an experienced traveler, so
you'll probably be fine, but...

If you're {{color id="0"}}also{{color id="-1"}} headed to Goron City, be
careful of Gorons with {{color id="0"}}strange rocks{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 0010
---
Also?

---
label: Talk_1012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}} up this mountain
path toward the city.

I pointed a traveler in that direction quite
some time ago, but there's been no sign
of them coming back.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's hard not to imagine they've gotten
into some sort of trouble...

---
label: Talk_1016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's a {{color id="0"}}restaurant{{color id="-1"}} up this mountain
path toward the city.

I pointed a traveler in that direction quite
some time ago, but there's been no sign
of them coming back.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I've been so worried about what could
have happened that I've hardly been able
to sleep at night...

---
label: Talk_1015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So just try to give a wide berth to any
Gorons you might see with {{color id="0"}}strange rocks{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: 0011
---
Strange rocks?

---
label: Talk_1013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Gorons are typically so gentle
and hardworking.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Angry"}}But lately it seems the young ones have
stopped working altogether, and some
are even playing tricks on travelers...
I met one injured traveler who told me
that the Gorons in question all carried
"{{color id="0"}}strange rocks{{color id="-1"}}."

---
label: Talk_1018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I don't really know what this all means...


But it's the duty of a stable to keep its
guests safe, so I can't help but worry.

---
label: Talk_1019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}So if you {{color id="0"}}also{{color id="-1"}} plan to go to the city, watch
out for Gorons with strange rocks.

---
label: 0001
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_1014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's a stable's duty to keep travelers safe,
so if you ever find yourself in any trouble,
don't be shy about coming to us.

---
label: Near_03
---
Looking for directions?

---
label: Talk_2001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You don't really plan on going out and
about this late at night, do you?

---
label: Talk_2002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Setting out so early? 

---
label: Talk_2000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Most of the travelers who stop by our
stable are headed toward Goron City,
Zora's Domain, or Hyrule Castle.
Guiding them to wherever they're going
is one of my roles here.

Is there anywhere I can guide you?

---
label: Talk_2010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you want to be shown the way to
Goron City, Zora's Domain, or Hyrule
Castle, just say the word.

---
label: 0006
---
Where's Goron City?

---
label: Talk_2011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}If you proceed up the mountain path,
you'll find Goron City at the very end of
your climb.
The Gorons are wonderful folks, and just
wait until you see the {{color id="0"}}prices on the ores{{color id="-1"}}
at YunoboCo's {{color id="0"}}mineral market{{color id="-1"}}!
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}They had some recent trouble with these
strange rocks that made them act up a
little, but that's all over now.
The Gorons are back to their welcoming
selves, so go ahead and pay them a visit.

---
label: Talk_2015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}If you're looking for directions, just ask.
It is my job, after all.

---
label: 0007
---
Where's Zora's Domain?

---
label: Talk_2012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}If you want to get to Zora's Domain, your
best option is to follow the river upstream.

You'll know you've nearly made it when
you see the shiny blue entrance gate.

---
label: Talk_2013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}I hear that the Zora are dealing with this
strange, falling sludge right now.

Though I'm afraid I don't know much
about it myself.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's a stable out east near Zora's
Domain—Foothill Stable.

Maybe the proprietor there can tell you
more about what's going on.

---
label: Talk_2014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}By the way, that sludge that was troubling
the Zora is completely gone. I'm sure
they're even more relieved than I am.

---
label: 0008
---
Where's Hyrule Castle?

---
label: Talk_2016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Continue west along this road, keeping
your eye on the floating Hyrule Castle...

You'll find yourself in the middle of
Central Hyrule looking up at it before
you know it.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It was a truly beautiful castle once, but
now it looks so sinister...

I've heard rumors that the princess might
still be sealed away in there.

Whether that's true or not, I'll still be
praying for her safety.

---
label: 0009

Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_2017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There are more monsters out at night.
If you're feeling tired, why not rest until
morning at our stable?

---
label: Near_04
---
What a dear...

---
label: Talk_2100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}There's nothing cuter than the sleeping
face of my granddaughter.

---
label: Talk_2101
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, excuse me. If you would like me to
{{color id="0"}}show you around the area{{color id="-1"}}, I'd ask you
to please wait until morning.
This little girl is my granddaughter. She's
been fascinated by the sky ever since she
was able to lift her head.
Since the Upheaval, her eyes and
imagination have been fixed on those
islands floating up there.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Maybe when she grows up, she'll be like
those researchers and travel the world,
chasing her passions...{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's funny—when I dream of her future,
I can't help but want to spend time with
her now.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Sorry, but if you'd like me to {{color id="0"}}show you
around the area{{color id="-1"}}, could you please wait

label: Talk_2112

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm always happy to talk, but would it be
all right if we moved this conversation
under a tree and out of the rain?

label: Near_100

It's not letting up...

I swear, this weather...
