{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey! Fella! What're you thinking, strolling
into this war zone?

You must've seen the "Beware of Gorons
Goin' Wild for Primo Red Rocks" headline
in the paper, right?

---
label: Talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So what's your story? Gettin' in some
Goron City sightseein' now that it's nice
and peaceful again?
Ah, I get it. You saw the big "YunoboCo
Reborn!" headline plastered all over the
papers, didn'tcha?

---
label: 0000
---
What headline?

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay15}} You're kiddin' me. Don't you read
the papers? Here, lemme give you a
sample of this peerless reporting.
"Goron scams are rampant these days,
so {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}-bound travelers should
exercise caution."
And ya see who wrote that? Me, Douma,
reporter extraordinaire! What, you've
never heard of me?!

---
label: Talk_0018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huh?{{delay15}} No foolin'? I figured everyone
woulda heard by now, but here's a little
snippet to give you the rundown.
"Marbled rock roast, which drove Gorons
batty, is no more! Apologetic YunoboCo
announces efforts to rebuild the city."
And y'know who wrote that piece?{{delay8}}
This lady. {{delay15}}So try pickin' up a newspaper
once in a while, will ya?

---
label: 0001
---
I even read the article!

---
label: Talk_0009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}You're lyin' through your teeth!{{delay15}} If you
really read the article, you wouldn't be
here in the first place!
"Goron scams are rampant these days,
so {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}-bound travelers should
exercise caution."
How do I know that quote off the top of
my head? 'Cause I wrote it, bud! I'm
Douma, the famous reporter!

---
label: Talk_0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Checks out! Article probably gotcha all
curious, huh? Hard to keep away after
reading a quote like...
"Marbled rock roast, which drove Gorons
batty, is no more! Apologetic YunoboCo
announces efforts to rebuild the city."
The news is great and all, but the writing?
Mm! That really drives it home. And you
know who wrote it? Me!

---
label: Talk_0017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Eh, but that's yesterday's news. Time is
money, and I ain't rich enough to spend
it talkin' to some random stranger.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I gotta get back on the trail of the great
mystery! It's something so secret that
nobody has figured it out!
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}...{{delay8}}*cough*

---
label: Talk_0023
---
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Hey! Now's the part where you're
supposed to ask, "The great mystery?"

---
label: 0002
---
The great mystery?

---
label: Talk_0007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Aw, geez. I hate to let this slip, but since
you want to know sooo badly, I guess I
can let you in on it.
We all know Gorons lived underground
way back when, but the particulars are
still a total mystery. A great one, even!
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}All we know is the place's name...
{{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}.

And you're lucky to even get that! Ask
most Gorons and they'll tell ya they don't
know a thing.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}But am I gonna let that stop me? No!
Because I'm an awesome reporter!

I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
great mystery and turn it into an even
greater book!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}"Douma's Guide to the Unknown" is
gonna fly off the shelves. Time to start
practicing my signature!

label: Near_0005

A mysterious city...

---
label: Talk_0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}As a knock-your-socks-off reporter,
there's no mystery I can't solve.

Heh heh... Just gotta perfect my signature
for when the book comes out.

---
label: Talk_0019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'm callin' my book "Douma's Guide to
the Unknown."

The first part's a deep dive into the lost
underground city of Gorondia. I'll leave
no stone unturned!
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}So whaddaya think, huh?{{delay15}} Sounds pretty
great, right?

---
label: 0003
---
What's Gorondia?

---
label: 0004
---
Goodbye.

---
label: Talk_0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}First off, I should probably try to find a
Goron who knows about {{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}...

---
label: Talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I ain't got time to snooze!


I gotta find me a Goron who knows
somethin' about {{color id="0"}}Gorondia{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Near_0003
---
Gorondi— Huh?

---
label: Talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}I heard a Goron talkin' about Gorondia,
so I tailed him here. But, uh...

Is...{{delay15}} Is this really Gorondia?!{{delay15}}


{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}No, right? Kinda felt like a "no" when I
was tailin' him... {{delay15}}I mean, any way ya slice
it, this is Mine-Cart Land.
Maybe the whole rumor was a buncha
bunk to begin with.

Now what do I do?{{delay15}} I told my news agency
that I was chasin' a huge lead just before
I came here, and this ain't huge.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}...


{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}That's it!{{pageBreak}}There's Mine-Cart Land, the hot springs,
the YunoboCo stores... Whole
lotta stuff to see around here.
Makes you wish ya had a guidebook for
Goron City, huh? Maybe one written by
your favorite reporter?
Gonna have to update my book's title
though. How 'bout, "Douma's Guide to
Goron City"?
Yeah, that'll do. That'll do just fine!

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I'll forget about Gorondia for now.
Mine-Cart Land here has inspired
me to write a guidebook!
I'll cover this place, the hot springs, and
the YunoboCo gem shops too! Oh, and the
book needs a title change.
Goodbye, "Douma's Guide to the
Unknown." Hello, "Douma's Guide to
Goron City."
Yeah.{{delay15}} That's the stuff.

Simmerstone Springs next?

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The water's clear and colorless...with a
slight volcanic smell. A nice, long soak is
sure to melt your *yawn* fatigue away.{{delay15}}
How am I supposed to write about fatigue
when I'm this tired? Maybe I gotta hit a
hot spring myself.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The closest option's {{color id="0"}}Goron Hot Springs{{color id="-1"}} to
the south, but maybe I'll check out those
{{color id="0"}}Simmerstone Springs{{color id="-1"}} I've heard about.
I've heard they're in a place called
{{color id="0"}}Gorko Tunnel{{color id="-1"}}, which is even {{color id="0"}}farther
south{{color id="-1"}} than Goron Hot Springs.
{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}But I've never even seen that tunnel!
How's a gal supposed to get refreshed?!

Now that's a deal.

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Heh heh...


YunoboCo stores sell ore for half the
normal price.

In the city, they sell diamonds and
sapphires... But along the road, they
sell rubies and flint.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Wait! {{delay15}}Half the normal price? That's a
steal! I better stock up before I head
back home.
