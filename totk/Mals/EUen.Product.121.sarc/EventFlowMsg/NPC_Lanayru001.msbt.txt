Going shield surfing?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hey, that was pretty rad work before,
rescuing our coach, Selmie.{{pageBreak}}I bet she'd show ya how to shred the
slopes on a shield. Like, give you
challenges. Teach you what's what.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}And if ya go shield surfing and your
shield breaks, no problem. Come back
to the cabin here.
I'll give ya my very own shield, totally
for free...{{delay15}} Ha! You wish!

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ask our coach, Selmie. She'll get ya
right into a practice challenge.

If all that sliding busts your shield, come
back to the cabin here.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I'll give ya one of my spare shields.
But ya know, not for free.

---
label: Talk14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Can't thank ya enough for rescuing
Coach. You and me, we gotta push each
other to learn it all.

---
label: Near02
---
Need a shield?

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}How's it going with the shield surfing?


Bust a shield yet?{{delay8}} If you do, feel free
to use any of the shields here.

Oops. Hang on.{{delay8}} I don't mean free-free.
You still gotta pay for 'em. Sorry.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If you bust your shield, feel free to use
one of the shields right here.

And I'll feel free to charge ya a price!{{delay15}}
Gotta pay Coach for my lessons...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}All the shields here are good to go,
specially for rookies.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Try 'em out!{{delay15}} Fair prices all around.

label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Hey! See anything ya like?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Good pick for getting into shield surfing.
So, how about {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}} for that?

---
label: Com_Talk_50b
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Solid choice. Handy for shield surfing,
and good for battle. It's yours for
{{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Com_Talk_50c
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Chat_01"}}Sturdier shield there. That means it'll
stand up to sliding for a longer time,
even if slopes aren't snowy.
It's a little steep at {{color id="0"}}{{number18 ref="Shop_TradeItemPrice" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="rupee" arg2="rupees" arg3=""}}{{color id="-1"}}, but
worth it. So, want to buy it?

---
label: 5500
---
I'll buy it!

---
label: 5501
---
I don't need it.

---
label: Com_Talk_53
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad"}}Oh, OK.{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, ya know where to find me if you ever
need a shield.

---
label: Com_Talk_55
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Huh? Looks like your pouch is full. Can't
hand the shield over like this. Stop by
once you've made space.

---
label: Talk1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thanks, man. Enjoy the slopes!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}Coach is in the cabin, so talk to her if
you want to get sliding, yeah?

---
label: Near04
---
Hey! Don't step on that!

---
label: Talk1002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}This one's for sale, so can you please not
walk all over it?

---
label: Near03
---
Sold out, but...

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Hey, shield surfer! Sorry, but I've run
out of shields to sell ya.

But the good news is there's a whole
world of shields out there. And some
GREAT ones for surfing too.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Like, uh...{{delay15}} Oh yeah!{{delay8}} The {{color id="0"}}Hylian shield{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}That's the shield we ALL want.
Legendary! Heard of it?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's tougher than other shields. Takes a
beating on the slopes, no matter how
harsh the terrain. Lasts a long time.
Oh yeah, a real beauty as well!


{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}They say that shield is somewhere inside
{{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}, but...{{delay15}}it's up in the sky
these days.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}Guess that's just going to stay where it
is then, right? Bummer.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'd love to go shield surfing with a
{{color id="0"}}Hylian shield{{color id="-1"}}, just once.

Yeah, I'd be trying to get my hands on it
too—if it wasn't in {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}, up
there in the sky.

---
label: Talk22
---
{{anim type="Notice"}}Hm? {{delay8}}Hmmm? {{delay15}}That's not what I think it is,
right? {{delay8}}Is that seriously the {{color id="0"}}Hylian shield{{color id="-1"}}?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL"}}What are YOU doing walking around with
a legendary shield?!{{pageBreak}}Don't tell me you got it in {{color id="0"}}Hyrule Castle{{color id="-1"}}.
That place is too high up off the ground
to get into!

---
label: Talk22_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I dunno how you got your hands on it,
but I do know that shield is supposed to
be incredible for surfing!
{{anim type="Happy"}}Can't blame you for parading it around.{{delay15}}
I'd do the same in your shoes!

---
label: Talk23

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}I see what you're carrying. {{delay15}}Man, I wish that thing
was mine...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}
