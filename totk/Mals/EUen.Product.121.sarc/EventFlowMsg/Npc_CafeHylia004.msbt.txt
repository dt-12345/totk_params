{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Eh? What's up, bud? You trying to get
into this cave?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm not one to stop folks, but I'll tell ya
it's boiling {{color id="0"}}inside the cave{{color id="-1"}}. You'll be
{{color id="0"}}burned to a crisp {{color id="-1"}}going in there like that.

Burned to a crisp?

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}The caves here have lava in them, so {{color id="0"}}it's
burning hot inside{{color id="-1"}}. You'll turn to dust
unless you're a Goron.
For Hylians like us, we have to do
something extra to protect ourselves.

Mixing {{color id="0"}}fireproof lizards {{color id="-1"}}with{{color id="0"}} monster parts{{color id="-1"}}
to make fireproof elixirs, for example.

I can't help out with the ingredients, but
if you have them, feel free to use that pot
over there to make what you need.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Me? I'm completely {{color id="0"}}drenched {{color id="-1"}}from top
to bottom, so I won't be getting burnt
anytime soon.

{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{color id="-1"}}The caves around here still spew lava.
Which means they're boiling hot—you get
burned up pretty quick once inside them.
Anytime I go inside one of these caves,
I make sure I'm carrying a fireproof elixir.

You can whip one up real quick combining
a {{color id="0"}}fireproof lizard {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}monster parts {{color id="-1"}}in
a pot.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}But at this point, I'm used to the heat.
I just {{color id="0"}}soak myself in water{{color id="-1"}}, and I'm good
to go. The elixir's just in case.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Since you've got such great gear going
on, you probably don't need an earful
from me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Hey, buddy. You after {{color id="0"}}marbled

There are some in there, but the path to
them has collapsed, so you'll have to
be careful.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Ahhh, thanks.


I was getting overheated, so that helped.{{delay15}}


That should do it. {{delay15}}I'm good now.{{delay15}}
