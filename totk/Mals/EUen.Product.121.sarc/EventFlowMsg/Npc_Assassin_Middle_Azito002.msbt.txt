{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You the new guy they're all talking about?

---
label: Talk_05

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've got a reputation for being the
fastest recruit ever to {{color id="0"}}earn their place{{color id="-1"}}
in the Yiga Clan.
But that doesn't mean you get any special
treatment. Master Kohga's the only
special one around here!

---
label: Talk_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've got a reputation for mastering the
{{color id="0"}}Earthwake technique{{color id="-1"}} faster than anybody
we've ever seen.
Keep it up. The more you use that power,
the greater Master Kohga's infamy grows.

label: Talk_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You've got a reputation for being the
chosen user of the {{color id="0"}}Lightning Helm{{color id="-1"}}.
Nobody else could handle that thing.
Wear it everywhere you go and show off
its power as much as you can to honor
our great Master Kohga!

label: Talk_08

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Rumors are swirling that Master Kohga
was defeated by Link. Impossible!{{pageBreak}}Do not concern yourself with these lies,
but redouble your devotion.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If it isn't the new recruit I've heard so
much about...

label: Talk_07

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If it isn't the new recruit I've heard so
much about... The Depths squad might
have some use for you.

---
label: Talk_00
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The Depths are as good as ours!


And it's all thanks to Master Kohga
finding and surveying it before
anyone else!

---
label: Talk_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Our number of {{color id="0"}}bases{{color id="-1"}} in the Depths grows
by the day.

But we still don't have enough supplies!
What are you standing around for? Hurry
up and get to work!

label: Talk_02_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The way you carry yourself...{{delay15}} You must be
the one I've heard all the stories about.

label: Talk_05_2

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}From new recruit to blademaster faster
than anyone in Yiga history. Impressive.{{pageBreak}}But don't expect any special treatment.
Master Kohga's the only special one
around here!

label: Talk_06_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So the new blademaster everyone's 
talking about makes his appearance...{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_07_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If it isn't the brand-new blademaster.{{delay15}}
The Depths squad might have some
use for you.

---
label: Talk_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Our number of {{color id="0"}}bases{{color id="-1"}} in the Depths only
continues to increase.

We're still short on supplies of course,
so we'll be counting on you to help keep
everyone in line.
