Coming along nice...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Nice morning, isn't it?

---
label: Talk_1003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Hello there!

---
label: Talk_1004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Nice evening, isn't it?

---
label: Talk_1000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Oh, I know you. You're Professor Link,
right? I heard all about that from Symin.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}My name is Uma. I look after the Hateno
school garden.{{pageBreak}}You came right when I was finishing up
the prep work for this here plot.{{pageBreak}}Symin said we should ask you what to
plant in it. You know, to celebrate you
becomin' a teacher and all.

---
label: Talk_1001
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Well, well. I wondered when you'd be by.{{pageBreak}}Symin said we should ask you what to
plant in this here plot. You know, as
thanks for helpin' out with the school.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}You showed up just when I was finishing
the prep work for it.

---
label: Talk_1005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I could grow pumpkins, carrots, tomatoes,
wildberries, wheat, rice, or melons.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}If you bring me one of those, I'll extract
the seeds and plant 'em for you.

---
label: Talk_1006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}I s'pose it's raining, but what's that to
a gardener? Let's talk about what you'd
like to grow.

---
label: Talk_1007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Well, now. Let's get down to it. What
would you like to grow?

---
label: Near_2000
---
What should I plant?

---
label: Near_2001
---
A little water for the plants.

---
label: Talk_2000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Didja figure out what you want to grow?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}I can do pumpkins, carrots, radishes,
tomatoes, wildberries, or hydromelons.{{delay8}}
Wheat and rice too. Can't forget those.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Which of those sounds good to you?

---
label: Talk_2008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Before you decide, I should admit one
thing. {{delay8}}I have more experience with some
crops than others.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I don't know too much yet about raising
endura carrots and hearty radishes.{{pageBreak}}You'll have to forgive me if the yield on
those ends up a little lower than the rest.

---
label: Talk_2007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Uh-oh. Looks like you don't have anything
good for planting.

---
label: Talk_2006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I could grow pumpkins, carrots, tomatoes,
wildberries, wheat, rice, or hydromelons.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But if you don't have one of those, I can't
extract the seeds. Bring me one, and we
can get this plot started.

---
label: Talk_2003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}So you want a nice {{color id="0"}}{{string11 ref="NpcGardenInfo_HatenoVillage023.GrowActorName" otherArg="0xFFFF"}}{{color id="-1"}}
field?

---
label: 0001
---
Yes.

---
label: 0002
---
Plant something else.

---
label: Talk_2004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}It's fine, it's fine. No hurries, no worries.

---
label: Talk_2005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Certainly! I'll take that from you and be
pleased to do it.{{pageBreak}}Can't return anything once you hand it
over, mind, but if you feel like plantin'
something else, come see me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oh, and I hope you'll let me know about
your first harvest so I can be there to see!{{pageBreak}}I'm already hankerin' to see how the
crops turn out.{{pageBreak}}But you have to know, the important part
of growing good crops is to take your
time raising them.{{pageBreak}}You can't expect them to thrive while you
kill time at an inn or bonfire. That ain't
how things are done. The veggies know.{{pageBreak}}So it'll take a bit before they're ready to
harvest, but I'm already gettin' excited!

label: Near_3000

Hope they ripen soon!

---
label: Near_3001
---
Grow, li'l babies, grow!

---

Gotta wipe off the dew...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I retired quite a while ago, but I was a
farmer for many years.{{pageBreak}}Workin' the soil calms me down, even at
this age.{{pageBreak}}Didja come to see the garden too?

---
label: Talk_3014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The only reason I'm able to work the
fields again is 'cause Princess Zelda
built us that school.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{size value="80"}}Hope they find out what happened to the
princess soon...{{pageBreak}}{{size value="100"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, sorry. Did you need something
from me?{{size value="80"}}{{size value="100"}}

---
label: 0003
---
How's the garden?

---
label: Talk_3008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}We've got a nice little {{color id="0"}}{{string11 ref="NpcGardenInfo_HatenoVillage023.GrowActorName" otherArg="0xFFFF"}}{{color id="-1"}}
crop going.

---
label: Talk_3016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But they're still freshly planted, so it'll be
{{color id="0"}}quite a while{{color id="-1"}} before they're ready to
harvest. {{delay8}}These things take time, y'know.{{pageBreak}}Try to be patient, OK?

---
label: Talk_3017
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}They've still got {{color id="0"}}a ways to go{{color id="-1"}} before
they're ready to be harvested.{{pageBreak}}'Fraid you'll have to wait a while longer.

---
label: Talk_3018
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}I expect {{color id="0"}}it won't be too much longer{{color id="-1"}}
before they're ready for the harvest.{{pageBreak}}Try and hold out! It'll be worth the wait.

---
label: Talk_3019
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}They should be ready for the harvest
{{color id="0"}}anytime now{{color id="-1"}}. You won't have long to wait.

---
label: Talk_3020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}There are no shortcuts when it comes to
raising vegetables.{{pageBreak}}They won't grow if you while away the
hours at an inn or bonfire, so mind how
you pass the time.{{pageBreak}}And of course, if you want to grow
something else here, you can always ask.

---
label: 0004
---
Plant something else.

---
label: Talk_3005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't return anything I've already
planted. You still wanna go ahead?

---
label: Talk_3013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If you say so. We had a nice little garden
going here, but I don't mind pulling it up
if that's what you want.

---
label: 0007
---
Never mind.

---
label: Talk_3012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Good. We have a nice little garden going
here. It'd be a shame to pull it up.{{pageBreak}}I'll keep tending it, as you do.

---
label: 0005
---
That's fine.

---
label: Talk_3011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Just tell me you'll invite me to the very
first harvest!{{pageBreak}}It'll take a bit before they're ready to
pick, but I'm already gettin' excited!

---
label: Talk_3015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}We already have a lovely
{{color id="0"}}{{string11 ref="NpcGardenInfo_HatenoVillage023.GrowActorName" otherArg="0xFFFF"}} {{color id="-1"}}crop growing.{{pageBreak}}If you want to grow something else, go
get a sample of it and we'll see.

My ripe li'l babies!

---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Well, if it ain't Professor Link!

---
label: Talk_4000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Thanks for bein' so patient! Whaddaya
think? They're tasty-lookin', aren't they?{{pageBreak}}I was happy to tend 'em for you,
Professor Link.{{pageBreak}}It's all the same to me what you do with
the produce we grow here. And if you
wanna grow somethin' else, let me know.

---
label: Talk_4003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}What're you up to there, Professor Link?!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We grew that crop the natural way, so I'll
thank you to harvest it the natural way
as well!

---
label: Talk_4006
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Aaaieee! My precious crops are burning!

---
label: Talk_4007
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}I gotta put this fire out, quick!

---
label: Talk_4008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}*sigh* All my love and care almost came
to nothin'.{{pageBreak}}I'm raisin' these out of the goodness of
my heart. Please treat 'em nice.

---
label: Talk_4009
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Come to help me water the plants,
Professor Link?

---
label: Talk_4010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}That's sweet of you. I bet the crops are
glad to have a drink.

---
label: Talk_4011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Thing is, it's raining right now, so I'm not
sure the veggies need any more water.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Come back with that thing sometime the
sun's out. I bet they'll be thirstier then.
