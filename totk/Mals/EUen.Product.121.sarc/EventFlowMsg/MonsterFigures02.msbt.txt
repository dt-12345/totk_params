{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Everyone in the village seemed to like it,
so I could probably make more.

---
label: Talk02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Haarooo! Really?!


In that case, I implore you to make a
Horriblin next.

{{color id="0"}}Horriblins{{color id="-1"}} have big hands like VWOOSH
and a coat that's quite OOHWOW! They
also enjoy swinging from the ceiling.

---
label: Talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. Your description...{{delay8}}no...{{delay8}}I still don't
know what it looks like.

---
label: Talk04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Sorry. So sorry! I am an awful describer
of things.

I would draw you a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}} of a
Horriblin if I could. But there is no art to
be found in the bones of my body.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}But fret not! I, Kilton, will describe the
monster to you with much fervor and
many times over. Surely that will help!

---
label: Talk05
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Eh, well, {{delay8}}it would be better if I had
a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture {{color id="-1"}}to look at.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. I'm trying, but I can't picture what
it's supposed to look like.

Without a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture {{color id="-1"}}of that
{{color id="0"}}Horriblin{{color id="-1"}} thing, I'm not sure what
I can do.

---
label: Talk06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}What I'm saying is...


A {{color id="0"}}Horriblin{{color id="-1"}} has a colorful coat like
OOOH WOW and a charming,
droopy snout.
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Its hands are big like VWOOSH! Yes,
and it dangles from the ceiling too.

---
label: 0001
---
How about this picture?

---
label: 0002
---
I'll leave you to it.

---
label: Talk08
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Huu...{{delay15}}hayaaah!{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}


Th-that's it exactly! That is the Horriblin
I adore!

---
label: Talk28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}A magnificent picture-painting indeed.
And yes, that is very truly a monster!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Just...one teensy problem. It isn't a
Horriblin.

A {{color id="0"}}Horriblin{{color id="-1"}} has an astonishing patch of
fur on its back like OOOHWOW, while its
adorable hands are big like VWOOSH!

---
label: Talk39
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Ahh...{{delay15}} If only I had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}}
of a Horriblin...

---
label: Talk10
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ah, now this is a good picture! Let me
use it for reference, and I can make the
sculpture, no problem.

---
label: Talk11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}M-may we borrow it?

---
label: 0003
---
Of course!

---
label: 0004
---
I'll pick a different one.

---
label: 0005
---
Sorry, but no.

---
label: Talk40
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Hoofaa! Awww!{{size value="100"}}

---
label: Talk12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}If I had that picture, the sculpture would
be son and done. But...I can't force you.

---
label: Talk13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}All right, just leave it to me. I'll have it
made, son and done!

---
label: Talk16
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ha-hiyeeee!{{size value="100"}}


Why, this monster sculpture... It's more
impressive than I dreamed possible!

---
label: Talk17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It was nothing.

---
label: Talk19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now, would you find the most-perfect
spot for this sculpture on the {{color id="0"}}stage{{color id="-1"}}
over there? Please?

---
label: Talk20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Afraid I can't do that.

---
label: Talk21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Bwaaa?

---
label: Talk22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Pretty sure I said I can't be responsible
for that sort of thing. Too big a decision.
Too much responsibility. Hard pass.

---
label: Talk23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Awww... If only someone would {{color id="0"}}move it to
the stage{{color id="-1"}} and place it in a pleasing spot.

---
label: Talk24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}We went to so much trouble to get this
sculpture sculpted.

I want nothing more than to give it the
many looking eyeballs it deserves.

---
label: 0006
---
I found a nice spot for it.

---
label: Talk25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hwaaah?! What did you say?

---
label: Talk26
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ooh! OOOOOOH!{{size value="100"}}


It looks so natural here and so realistic
too! It's as if we've stumbled on a
monster's lair.
Yes, it's exactly what I was hoping for!

---
label: Talk27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Even I could swear I see the wind ruffling
its coat.

---
label: Talk30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Yes! Now we must put it in front of every
face in the village.

---
label: Talk31
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!


I present to you a new species of monster
called the Horriblin.

Do not fear, draw near! This is the
only place you can safely admire such
a creature up close. The only place!

---
label: Talk32
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Oooh, a new species?

---
label: Talk33
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
Now, give me your ears! All of them!

Once again, this monster is the lovable
Horriblin.

This new monster was discovered
in caves created by the Upheaval.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And what a stylish monster it is!
See how its colorful hair sprouts from
its tough skin!
You feel the urge to reach out and ruffle
its locks, don't you? Yes! I feel that very
same feeling so very much!
And yet, it might be best to keep your
hands to yourself...if you want to keep
your hands at all, that is.

---
label: Talk34
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It is rather stylish.

---
label: Talk35
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
Understand what you fear and you'll
feel great!
For those with an open mind, wonders
always await!

---
label: Talk36
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Thank you! Thank you!


Again I find myself in your debt.


Please, allow me to give you a gift to
show my gratitude.

---
label: Talk37
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}This dish is a specialty of mine. I hope
your mouth enjoys it!

The homemade seasoning I gave you last
time gives it its secret flavor. Since you're
here, I'll give you another bottle!

---
label: Talk38
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}You may wonder what use you could
have for such a thing,{{delay15}} but I promise
it's quite handy.
For so long I've dreamed of collecting
these sculptures and showing the world
how wonderful monsters truly are.
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}And now that dream is coming true...
all because of you! Thank you!
Thank you many times again!

---
label: Talk43
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}Kilton...would it be all right if I made more
sculptures? For you, I mean.

Been a while since I've been this excited
about making stuff.

---
label: Talk44
---
{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Yaaawheeelalala!{{size value="100"}}


Why, if those aren't the exact words
I wanted to fall into my ears!

Yes, thank you! Thank you, yes!

---
label: Talk45
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Though it would help if you got better
at, you know...describing monsters.

---
label: Talk46
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}Or maaaybe...somebody...will bring us
another picture of a monster.

---
label: Talk47
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Yep, it would be a big help if somebody
brought us a picture.

---
label: Talk65
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}But look at that! Your pouch is full to 
the tip of the top!

I've got a dish and some monster extract
to give you, but first you'll have to make
room to carry it.

---
label: Talk66
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Hooyagee?! {{delay8}}I was going to give you a
gift of thanks, but your pouch is full to
the brim.
Make some room in there and I'll give
you the dish and monster extract I have
waiting for you.
