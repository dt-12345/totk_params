This sand shroud...

I'd melt out there...

I'd freeze out there...

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_01"}}Hmm? Excuse me?


{{color id="0"}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{color id="-1"}}If you're looking to {{color id="0"}}rent a sand seal{{color id="-1"}}, go
right ahead. Don't mind me.

I'm busy trying to figure out how I'll get
back to {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal_00"}}What? You're also hoping to go to
{{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}}?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Voe aren't allowed inside the walls, so
even if you managed to get there, you'd
be turned away at the gate.

Gerudo Town?

---
label: talk0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}It's a bit hard to see it right now because
of the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}} covering the desert...

---
label: talk0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}Look far in the distance. Do you see
that shrine peeking out above the
{{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}?
That's where {{color id="0"}}Gerudo Town{{color id="-1"}} is.

---
label: talk0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Shrines just like that one appeared all
over the world after the Upheaval.

Lucky for me too—if that one hadn't
shown up, I'd have completely lost sight
of {{color id="0"}}town{{color id="-1"}}.
Of course, it's {{color id="0"}}really hard to see{{color id="-1"}} inside
the {{color id="0"}}sand shroud{{color id="-1"}}, so it might be impossible
to reach town even with a sand seal.

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}I was supposed to investigate those ruins too,
but trying to travel in the sand shroud was a
terrible idea.
Maybe I should just stay at {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar {{color id="-1"}}and
rest. It'd mean giving up getting back to town, but...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What? {{delay8}}Hey, it may look like I'm slacking
off, but I'm not!

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Even we Gerudo get tired working under
the blazing heat of this desert sun.

The best way to make it bearable is a nice
break every now and then.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What? {{delay8}}Hey, it may look like I'm slacking

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}Even we Gerudo get tired working in the
desert. It's not exactly easy to move
around in all the sand...

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}That was some amazing sand-seal
steering!

It's exciting just to remember it!


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I really hope one day I'll become as good
as you...

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Maybe I should try getting a job at the sand-seal
rental shop when this is all said and done.{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}There's a scholar in Gerudo Town, you
know. Rotana is her name. She's been
really busy lately...
Which means I've taken on the job of
investigating these ruins!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}The statues here are supposed to
represent the seven Gerudo heroines, so
you'd think there would be seven of them.
Where did the other two go?

---
label: talk0007
---
{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I want to hurry and wrap up this investigation.
The heroine statues are interesting...but I'm tired. 

Once I report back to Rotana, I can head straight
to the canteen and refresh with a delicious
Noble Pursuit...{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}What? {{delay8}}Listen, it may look like I'm slacking
off or something, but that's not the case.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Even we Gerudo get tired working in the
freezing cold of the desert nights.

The best way to make it bearable is a nice
break every now and then.
