{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Heh heh...{{delay15}} I overheard some great info
on {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Aaand it looks like you overheard me.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Perfect! This is so juicy, I've gotta share!
You've heard of Misko's treasure? The
famous bandit's huge {{color id="0"}}clothing collection{{color id="-1"}}?
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}The story goes that Misko {{color id="0"}}hid it in caves
all throughout the land{{color id="-1"}}. Just the thought
gets my fashion-loving heart pounding!

---
label: talk03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Oh, hey! We meet again.


The story goes that Misko's legendary
clothing collection is {{color id="0"}}hidden in caves
throughout the land{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}As a devotee of fashion, I intend to find
every last piece!

---
label: StartPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard the story from a {{color id="0"}}pair of treasure-
hunting brothers{{color id="-1"}} I met.

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you want to know more, why not talk to
them yourself? They were {{color id="0"}}in front of a
cave just up north{{color id="-1"}}.

label: StartPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're curious about {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}},
you should ask those brothers about it!{{pageBreak}}They're {{color id="0"}}in front of a cave north of here{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoalPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They say the caves of Eldin are practically
bursting with treasure.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Which would be very exciting if they
weren't also {{color id="0"}}bursting with lava{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}If I walked into one dressed like this,
my clothes would be burned to a crisp.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Many of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasures {{color id="-1"}}are hidden
in caves across Eldin...but those caves
are {{color id="0"}}white hot with bubbling lava{{color id="-1"}}.
Unfortunately for me, I'm not dressed for
cave-diving. I'd hate for my outfit to catch
on fire.{{delay15}} Again.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I was hoping a nice concert might help
perk me up.

But the band seems busy right now.{{delay15}} I'll
try waiting a bit. If they don't get things
sorted out, I can come back later.

---
label: GoalPoint_01_4
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}I was hoping a nice concert might help
brighten my day.{{pageBreak}}But it looks like the band isn't even here.
Just my luck.{{delay15}}

---
label: GoalPoint_01_5
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}Well, since I'm here, I can do my thinking
after I watch the band perform.

---
label: RainPoint_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Unfortunately, I can't find a cave to
shelter in... What I wouldn't give to be
out of this rain.

---
label: RainPoint_01_2
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Rainy days are the worst. I start the day
as an elegant fashionista and end it as a
sad, soggy mop.
Now I understand why Misko hid their
collection in caves.{{delay8}} You have to keep
your clothes dry somehow.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard the story from a {{color id="0"}}pair of
treasure-hunting brothers{{color id="-1"}} I met
near Foothill Stable.
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}If you want to know more, why not go
talk to them? Foothill Stable is {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}
of here.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}If you're curious about {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}},

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}They say that several of {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasures{{color id="-1"}}
are hidden in the many caves of Lanayru!{{pageBreak}}So it's a shame that the walls of those
caves are {{color id="0"}}wet and slippery{{color id="-1"}} and slimy and
BLECH because of all the water in there.
If you think I'm bringing any part of my
wardrobe into that muck, think again!{{pageBreak}}If only there were some chic outfit that
let me climb walls without slipping...
