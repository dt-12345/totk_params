{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}I know you... {{delay8}}We met that one time,
didn't we?

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}You know. {{delay8}}After my interview with {{color id="0"}}Josha{{color id="-1"}}
for the {{color id="0"}}chasm researcher position{{color id="-1"}}.

{{color id="2"}}{{size value="80"}}When I walked away a miserable failure...{{size value="100"}}{{color id="-1"}}


Quite a tough interviewer, Josha was.
I doubt even the most gifted scientific
mind could have held up to her scrutiny.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Yes, I remember now! {{delay8}}I ran into you
after my interview with {{color id="0"}}Josha {{color id="-1"}}for the
{{color id="0"}}chasm-researcher position{{color id="-1"}}.
Quite a tough interviewer, Josha was.
I wonder who could possibly have held up
to her scrutiny.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}You may look at me and think, {{delay8}}"That
man is not a doctor." {{delay8}}But in fact, that is
precisely my vocation.
And being somewhat not-young, I feel an
urgency to make a lasting mark on the
profession before my sunset years.
That was why I volunteered for the
{{color id="0"}}Zonai Survey Team{{color id="-1"}}.

You see, I believe that new elixirs and
remedies might be derived from the {{color id="0"}}plant
and animal life {{color id="-1"}}found in {{color id="0"}}chasms{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}That's why I'm here. This is my chance to
be on the ground floor of the new field of
chasm medicine!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Raffish hairstyle aside, I am in fact a
doctor. {{delay8}}Really! I'll prove it by teaching
you how to make elixirs.
The explanation is rather long, so you may
want to write it down. {{delay8}}*ahem*

Step one—{{delay8}}simmer {{color id="0"}}bugs {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}monster parts{{color id="-1"}}
in a {{color id="0"}}pot{{color id="-1"}}.

Oh... That's it. {{delay15}}Didn't take as long as
I was expecting.

{{anim type="Happy"}}You can yield different medicines
depending on the ingredients' properties,
so please, experiment at will!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_01"}}I must admit...{{delay15}}all this walking has worn me
out.{{delay15}} I long for a cozy bed at the stable.

Since I'm low on stamina, I may treat
myself to a {{color id="0"}}Malanya bed{{color id="-1"}}. Then I'll wake
up good and refreshed!
{{size value="80"}}{{color id="2"}}I'll also hear a strange voice in my sleep, but that's
neither here nor there...{{color id="-1"}}{{size value="100"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}The best remedy for low stamina is a

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Most people seem to dislike rain, but

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}After all, rain covers up the sound of
footsteps. It's perfect for walking past
monsters without being noticed.

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}We're close now—{{delay8}}very near the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}

I'd hate to get hurt and bring my travels

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}I came to see the {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} nearby, but now

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}A number of {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} fell from the sky and
landed here in the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru Wetlands{{color id="-1"}}.

They range from small fragments to huge
pieces of debris. I hear you can even go
inside one of them!
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Intrigued as I am, I'm not sure I'd know
how to enter an ancient {{color id="0"}}ruin{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Among all the {{color id="0"}}fallen ruins {{color id="-1"}}here in the

The trick would be knowing how to get
inside... Which I don't.

A {{color id="0"}}chasm{{color id="-1"}} was just discovered there.{{delay15}}

A deep, gaping hole that's bound to be
full of undiscovered {{color id="0"}}plant and animal life{{color id="-1"}}!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}I would simply love to explore it...{{delay15}}were it

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Among the {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}} that fell in the {{color id="0"}}Lanayru

Apparently one structure there is so large,
