Do what your heart feels.

It takes all kinds, I guess.

It's risky to go unarmored.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. You're up early.

---
label: Talk_Greeting_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link.

---
label: Talk_Greeting_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link. Hard to believe it's night
already. Would you like to rest at
the inn?

---
label: Talk_Greeting_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Link! You must be soaked through!


Unless... Do you have {{color id="0"}}armor made for
bad weather{{color id="-1"}}? 

Our clothes are specially made using
Sheikah technology. They keep us dry
in any weather.
I hope you have armor that does that too.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}{{anim type="Think"}}Link... I don't know if you're attempting
to make a joke, but that mask is in very
poor taste.

I'll be back soon...

---
label: Ballon_03
---
What to do first...

---
label: Ballon_04
---
Left it out again.

---

Are they already asleep?

They grow up so fast...

Papa will...protect you...

My daughter made that.

Ah, there's Lady Paya.

---
label: talk0008
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}Good grief. It's {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}}'s duty to take
care of the village...

But whenever I take my eyes off her,
she's elbow-deep in some trivial new
problem. I...{{delay15}} Hm?

---
label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Who...{{delay15}} Is that really you...{{delay15}}


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}L-{{delay15}}Link?{{size value="100"}}


Why, it's been some time! You gave me
quite a shock. I didn't expect to see you
appear here in our village.
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}And right now, too, while our chief is...

---
label: talk0019

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I... {{delay15}}I...


{{size value="125"}}{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}L-{{delay15}}Link?!{{size value="100"}}


Why are you wearing that awful mask?!


{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I haven't had a scare like that in a
long time...

But I could never mistake you for one
of the Yiga Clan.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}*sigh* And right now, too, while our
chief is...

---

---
The chief?

---
label: talk0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Ah, I suppose you haven't heard. The
former chief, Lady Impa, retired.

Now {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}} is the {{color id="0"}}chief of Kakariko
Village{{color id="-1"}}. I've been working as her
assistant, but...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}Lady Paya is ignoring her responsibilities.
She won't listen to anything I say! All
these {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} have her full attention.

---
label: talk0020
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}But...

---
label: talk0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}Even now, she's under one of the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}with the Zonai Survey Team.
That ruin, over there.

---
label: talk0015
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}I wonder... Maybe seeing you will remind
her about her responsibilities as {{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}}.

Would you do me a favor and stop by to
see {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk_0022
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Ah, Link, pardon me.


{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I'm sorry, but {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}} is still deep in
discussion with the Zonai Survey Team.

---
label: talk_0021
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_01"}}The Ring Ruins may be important assets
to the village...

But it worries me to see her so obsessed.


{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hm. Perhaps seeing you would remind her
about her responsibilities as {{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_0032
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}Why are you wearing an awful outfit
like that?

My insides turned to ice for a
moment there.

---
label: talk_0033
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I have to say, I think dressing like that
is in very poor taste.

---
label: talk_0034
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Both our local clothes and the Yiga Clan
outfits are made using Sheikah crafting
techniques, so they're good in rain...
But do you really have to wear that
around here?

---
label: talk0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I'll bet you could find her with the Zonai
Survey Team right now. They're probably
by the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} near the chief's house.

---
label: talk_0010
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm on my way to visit my wife. I'll head
to the chief's house when I'm done.

It sure feels good to have Lady Paya back
in charge!

---
label: talk_0002
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I was just saying hello to my wife before
heading to the chief's house.

With one of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins {{color id="-1"}}closed off,
I can't reach the cemetery. But it's the
thought that counts, not the place.
I'm sure my wife will hear my words
wherever I say them.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm just saying hello to my wife before

Her grave is by the ruins, but Lady Paya
and the others are busy investigating.
I don't want to get in the way.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Sometimes I wish she would do more as
the chief...

But when I see her so excited and
earnest, it's hard to bring it up.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}No matter. I'm sure my wife will hear our
words wherever we are.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}My wife... She lost her life due to
my carelessness.

I can never make up for that. Even so, my
children and the village have forgiven me.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'll do my best to repay everyone's
kindness by helping {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}}. It's...
It's the least I can do.

---
label: talk_0014
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I made a promise to my wife to protect
our children and the village she loved.

I'll fulfill my promise by helping {{color id="0"}}Lady{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}Paya{{color id="-1"}}. And when I see our children's
smiling faces, it'll all be worth it.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}You're right. When we pray, we'll

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I'm going to the chief's house.


Lady Paya often has business elsewhere,
so someone needs to be there.

---
label: talk_0009

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that I think about it, with {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}} large
ruins crashing down, it's a miracle no one
was hurt.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I wonder why {{color id="0"}}Zelda{{color id="-1"}} only {{color id="0"}}sealed off{{color id="-1"}} one
of them...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Ah, please excuse me. My thoughts are
wandering today.

Anyway, I don't think there's another site
like the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} anywhere in Hyrule.
You should take a look.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Now that I think about it, with {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}} large
ruins crashing down, it's a miracle no one
was hurt.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}And this miracle wouldn't have
meant a thing if it weren't for
Lady Paya's leadership.
*sigh* I just wish she weren't so focused
on the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

But she's come such a long way as chief.
And I plan to be there for her as she
continues to grow.

---
label: talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}If just one of those {{color id="0"}}five{{color id="-1"}} ruins had fallen
a little differently, Kakariko Village might
have been wiped out. Scary, right?
Seemingly small things have such a big
impact. The {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}} landing next
door, {{color id="0"}}Lady Paya{{color id="-1"}} becoming chief...
The world as we know it is made up of
one tiny miracle after another.

---
label: talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Lady Paya is still young, so I understand
her enthusiasm with the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}But, and this is just between us, I wonder
if it's more of an obsession. I hope she
realizes soon what it means to be {{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: talk_0026
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The village has thrived thanks to the
{{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}, and that's a fact.

But sometimes I wonder if her enthusiasm
for them borders on obsession...

{{resetAnim arg="[5,0]"}}When is she going to realize that she's
the {{color id="0"}}chief{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: talk_0024
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I heard that Lady Paya helped Tauro and
company with their investigation.

With the mystery of the {{color id="0"}}Ring Ruins{{color id="-1"}}
sorted out, the village will flourish
more than ever. 
I was...I was wrong to think she
wasn't taking her responsibilities
as chief seriously.
In the end, Lady Paya was more
concerned for the village than anyone.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}That book contains findings from the

Lady Paya has pored over it. I have no

I used to think she cared more about the

But I sure had it backward. Without her

I just wish I understood sooner.

No, best to wait it out...
