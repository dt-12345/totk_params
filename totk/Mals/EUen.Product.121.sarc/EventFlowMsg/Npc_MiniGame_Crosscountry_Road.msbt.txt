{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Hey, hey! I thought I recognized you!
{{delay8}}You're the superstar who got me out of
that jam with the Yiga Clan.
Oh, and how's the Yiga armor I tailored
treating you?{{delay8}} That was rhetorical. I made
it, so I know it's perfect.
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Seriously though. Thanks for setting me
free back there. I mean it.

Ever since, I've been running all over the
place, looking for {{color id="0"}}fashion treasures{{color id="-1"}} and
having the time of my life. Cheers for that!

a sec there...{{delay8}}but I could never forget the

And man, you're even rockin' that Yiga
armor I tailored!{{delay8}} Super comfy, right?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Seriously, though, thanks again for the
save back there. You are the GUY, guy.{{pageBreak}}Thanks to you, instead of rotting in a cell,

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}Well, well, well. You came back, superstar!{{pageBreak}}That can only mean one thing—you wanna

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}I know the Yiga Clan did sorta kidnap me
and force me to make that armor, but
seeing you wear it fills me with...pride?
Yeah. Yeah, pride! {{delay15}}I'm proud to see you
making some good out of bad.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}It's not just the armor you've taken a

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}According to fashion legend, the famous
bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}} had a signature outfit {{color id="0"}}for
adventuring in freezing climes{{color id="-1"}}.
The rumors say the whole look is hidden
right here in {{color id="0"}}Hebra{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Just between us, I hear that one piece of the outfit
is in {{color id="0"}}Lake Kilsie Cave {{color id="-1"}}to the {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I SWEAR, if you get there before me,
I'll... I'll...{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}Nah, I'm just kiddin', superstar.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's treasure. {{delay8}}The finders-keepers rule is

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}The iconic bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}'s winter look is

{{size value="80"}}{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}I can't say this too loudly,{{delay8}} but I heard that {{color id="0"}}Misko's
treasure{{color id="-1"}} is hidden in {{color id="0"}}Lake Kilsie Cave inside this
mountain pass{{color id="-1"}}...{{delay15}}
A Rito told me that you can only get into that cave
from the {{color id="0"}}north side{{color id="-1"}} of the lake too.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{size value="100"}}But those pickings aren't as easy as you'd
hope. {{delay15}}There's not so much as an animal
trail to {{color id="0"}}Lake Kilsie{{color id="-1"}}, let alone a road.
To top it all off, the lake's surrounded
by steep precipices. Let me tell ya,
precipices? Not fashion-friendly.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}But giving up would mean falling out of
style...{{delay8}}and that's something I'll never do!

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Some say that the legendary bandit {{color id="0"}}Misko{{color id="-1"}}
actually INVENTED fashion.{{pageBreak}}And some of their very favorite clothes
are supposed to be hidden in {{color id="0"}}a cave at
Lake Kilsie{{color id="-1"}} to the {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}}!{{delay15}}
I know that the cave is on the {{color id="0"}}north side{{color id="-1"}}
of the lake, but it isn't easy to get there.
No roads, no trails, not even a path!{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}But if I give up now...{{delay15}}I might fall from
the cutting edge of fashion! If there's
no path, I'll just make my own!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'd never say a word against clothes

this outfit is really cold.
My wardrobe is practically crying out for
Misko's {{color id="0"}}favorite cold-weather clothes{{color id="-1"}}!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}The only way to stop this shivering is to
go to {{color id="0"}}Lake Kilsie Cave{{color id="-1"}} and claim that
iconic garb for myself.
The cave's tucked away in {{color id="0"}}Dronoc's Pass{{color id="-1"}}
up {{color id="0"}}north{{color id="-1"}}, surrounded by steep cliffs.{{pageBreak}}But if I think about the obstacles, I'll stop

{{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}} is hidden in {{color id="0"}}Lake Kilsie Cave inside

Heads up though. A Rito told me that the cave is on
the {{color id="0"}}north side{{color id="-1"}} of the lake.{{size value="100"}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Even knowing that...{{delay15}}there are no roads
leading to{{color id="0"}} Lake Kilsie{{color id="-1"}}. Not so much as a

It's also surrounded on all sides by steep

Maybe I should stop by the {{color id="0"}}newspaper

{{delay8}}There's not a road to be seen around

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I got a little problem here though... I, uh,

Misko didn't exactly choose a hiding

fashionably minded.{{pageBreak}}Maybe I should swing by the newspaper
