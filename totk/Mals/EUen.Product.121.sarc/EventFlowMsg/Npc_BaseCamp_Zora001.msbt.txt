{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Scare_01"}}Urp! {{delay8}}The sludge is in my gills...{{delay8}} Ack!


Oh...{{delay8}} Our poor statue, The Turning Tide...{{delay8}}
is covered in sludge as well. Ugh.

How long must we endure the foul effects

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Traveler! {{delay15}}We are in your debt for this
great deed.

The sludge that was marring The Turning
Tide has disappeared completely!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I must report this to Lady Yona at once...
Urp!{{delay15}} Urgh...{{delay15}} I would like to share this
joyous news, however...
In this state, I fear that if I met with Lady
Yona... {{delay15}}Ugh...{{delay15}} I may dispel the contents
of my stomach upon her noble self. {{delay15}}Urp.

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}{{anim type="Tired_00"}}Ugh...{{delay8}} This is terrible.


I require my wits about me in order to
effectively patrol, but my gills are in
turmoil because of {{delay8}}the sludge.{{delay15}}
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}And yet...{{delay8}}I am heartened by the domain's
statue, The Turning Tide, being returned
to its pristine state.
It is truly so necessary for it to be
standing proud and shining brightly
in the middle of everything.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}When I gaze upon The Turning Tide,
I am heartened.{{delay15}} I am so glad that it is

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease_00"}}Urgh... {{delay15}}I appreciate your concern.


However, there is no time to dwell on
my misfortune.

You see, our brave Captain Bazz set out
for the Skyview Tower, to the west of the
domain, to investigate the sludge.
Us soldiers who remained behind must
vigilantly protect the domain.{{delay15}} Urgh... {{delay8}}Urp!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Yes! My voice is as good as gold again.
{{delay8}}I feel so much better.

Just earlier, Lady Yona treated my gills.


And look at me now! I can return to work
at full health once more!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Humming_01"}}Aaah! Aha haaa! Aha HAAA!

I am sooo happy {{delay8}}that Lady Yona
cured me!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}The sludge is no longer filling my gills!{{delay15}}
The treatment worked with such speed
that I only suffered minor symptoms.
It is all thanks to Lady Yona's cure!


All right! Oh, yeah! I will now get out
there and resume my patrol!

---
label: talk0009

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}I feel great! Fantastic, even! Lady Yona is
truly amazing!

Now I can patrol the domain as often and

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_01"}}Indeed! I am as good as new once again!{{delay8}}
What's more, I am positively overflowing
with motivation.
Captain Bazz set out for the Skyview
Tower, to the west of the domain, in
order to investigate the sludge.
That means we are short on Zora here.
We need every ounce of enthusiasm we
can muster!
Us soldiers who remained behind must
vigilantly protect the domain!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}I will! I will try my very hardest in the
absence of Captain Bazz!

Lookout Landing, eh?

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}We of the Zora brigade were sent here by

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Rumors have a way of making me feel
uncertain and ill at ease.

If only the waterfalls streaming out of the
castle reached all the way down to the
moat below.
If they did, we could simply swim up and
see for ourselves just what is going on
up there...
