{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS_00"}}We did it!{{delay15}}

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Hey, look. I think this might have been
a hideout for those monsters.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_00"}}Hmm? Was that the wind?

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_05
---
It couldn't have been! There's no way.
Must've been something else!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_06
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_01"}}Heyyy! Tulin! Link!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_07
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Huh?!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_08
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Oh!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_09
---
{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}That was some impressive teamwork,
you two!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_11
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}Aw! {{delay8}}You saw that, Harth?! Talk about
embarrassing.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_11_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I...{{delay8}}didn't listen when Gesane tried to
stop me. I thought I could handle it.{{pageBreak}}But I just ended up losing my favorite
bow to those stupid things.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}I thought I was fully-fledged, but there's
probably no way I could've gotten it back
on my own.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_12
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_00"}}I bet now you see why we were treating
you like a small chick.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_13
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Yeah.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}You were right—it really is important to
work as a flock.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}I think I finally get what Dad has been
trying to tell me all this time.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_14
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="Think_01"}}Is that all there is to the story?{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}It seems unlike you to let your bow be
taken, Tulin.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_15
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,1]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}Oh, yeah, funny story about that! There
was this whole thing with {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_16
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}I spotted her getting attacked by a
monster. It was such a surprise that I
dropped my guard and it stole my bow.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}But I guess she was fine, because then
she zoomed up {{color id="0"}}above that cloud{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_17
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="QuestionAngry_00"}}What? {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda flew above the
cloud?!{{color id="-1"}} How can that be?

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_18
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Hmm... Seems like a stretch, but we're
not going to get to the bottom of it sitting
around here.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_19
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Tulin, Link came out here looking for
Princess Zelda.{{pageBreak}}You should go with him, and {{color id="0"}}investigate
the cloud {{color id="-1"}}you say the princess
soared into.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_20
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Painful_00"}}Huh?! But I thought I wasn't allowed.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_21
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I got a report before coming here.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}We think it's likely that the blizzard is
coming from inside that cloud after all.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_22
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Sad_00"}}I want to see for myself as soon as I can,
but the strong winds make any {{color id="0"}}approach
from the sides impossible{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}The only way in is {{color id="0"}}through the top{{color id="-1"}}, but...

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_23
---
{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}There's not a Rito alive capable of
crossing this stormy sky and making it
all the way there.{{pageBreak}}Well. Except for one.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_30
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,1]"}}{{anim type="Understand_00"}}I'm talking about you, Tulin.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_24
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Only you have the skill and training to
{{color id="0"}}create gusts at will{{color id="-1"}}.{{pageBreak}}"Tulin will be the finest Rito warrior of all
once he understands the value of working
with his allies."
{{anim type="Happy_00"}}You know who said that to me? Your old
dad, Teba.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_25
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,1]"}}{{anim type="TuliNotice_00"}}Dad said that?

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_27
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}Yep. And I'll make sure he knows what
you accomplished here today.{{pageBreak}}Now it's time you go with Link to {{color id="0"}}find
Princess Zelda {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}whatever's causing
this blizzard{{color id="-1"}}!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_28
---
{{resetAnim arg="[6,1]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}No problem. The two of us together have
got this!

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_28_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Determination_00"}}I saw Princess Zelda up on the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}}
near Hebra Peak. {{delay15}}Let's check there first.

---
label: Dm_RT_0035_29
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_01"}}Link! Tulin! We're counting on you.
