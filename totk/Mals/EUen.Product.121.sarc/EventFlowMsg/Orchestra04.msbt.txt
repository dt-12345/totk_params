I'm in a real bind...

label: Talk_0001

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_01"}}Ugh...{{delay8}} Oh, hey!{{delay15}} Did you come down here
to rescue me?

---
label: 0003
---
It's a rescue!

---
label: 0004
---
Nope, I fell in.

---
label: Talk_0002_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}Why, thank you!

---
label: Talk_0002_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}It happens to the best of us.

---
label: Talk_0003
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I was heading to Rito Village, which is
suffering through a fierce blizzard, to
cheer them up with music and supplies.
I got my wagon going at a pretty good clip
on this road, but then I suddenly drove
into this hole. It's never been here before!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The horse I was riding ran off somewhere,{{delay8}}
and my cargo has spoiled. {{delay8}}The only thing
I have left is the {{color id="0"}}wagon{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0004
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}As if that weren't enough, now I'm wet...{{delay8}}
and cold...{{delay8}} Why did it have to rain?

---
label: Talk_0005
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I haven't figured out how to get {{color id="0"}}both me
and my wagon {{color id="-1"}}out this hole, and I won't
leave it behind.
Which leaves me stuck here, plain
and simple.

---
label: Talk_0006_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}I'm relieved that someone came to rescue
me, {{delay8}}but I hope you have a plan to {{color id="0"}}free me
from this hole{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0006_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's nice to know I'm not the only one this
happens to. {{delay8}}But it would be nicer if you
had a plan to {{color id="0"}}free us from this hole{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0011
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_01"}}*sigh* {{delay15}}I used to play horn with the {{color id="0"}}Stable
Trotters{{color id="-1"}}, it's true.

---
label: Talk_0012
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM_00"}}What?! {{delay15}}The Great Fairy went into hiding?{{delay15}}
And so the troupe is looking for me?

---
label: Talk_0013
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}Well, from bad to worse...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Have you heard how Rito Village north of
here is struggling to get enough food?
It really breaks my heart.
The Rito were always good to us when our
music troupe was touring the kingdom.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}So when I heard about a fierce blizzard
tearing into Rito Village, I couldn't just sit
and do nothing.
I slipped away from the troupe and made
for their village with supplies and songs
to ease their burdens.

---
label: Talk_0014
---
I got my wagon going at a quick trot on
this road, but then I suddenly drove into
this hole. It didn't use to be here!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}The horse I was riding ran off somewhere,{{delay8}}
and my cargo has spoiled. {{delay8}}The only thing
I have left is the {{color id="0"}}wagon{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0015
---
I didn't know that while I was stuck in this
hole, the Great Fairies went into hiding
and my troupe reformed.
It sounds like I should get out of this hole
and join back up with the Stable Trotters
as soon as I can, but...

---
label: Talk_0016
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't climb up the side of this hole. {{delay15}}Not
without {{color id="0"}}my wagon{{color id="-1"}}, at least, and I'd rather
not leave it behind.

---
label: Talk_0100
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}Hello again. How's everything going with
you? {{delay15}}Not much has changed for me, sad
to say. Still stuck in a big hole.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I've been playing my horn to keep my
spirits up. {{delay8}}But it hasn't lessened my
desire to get out of this hole any.

---
label: Talk_0101_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I can't climb up the wall of this hole, and
even if I could, I wouldn't want to leave
without my wagon.

---
label: Talk_0101_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Ahhh...{{delay15}}if only someone could {{color id="0"}}pull my
wagon out of the hole with me in it{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay15}}
Is that too much to hope for?

---
label: 0005
---
Get in the wagon!

---
label: 0006
---
That won't be easy.

---
label: Talk_0102_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}What? {{delay15}}You can actually make
this happen?

---
label: Talk_0102_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}All right, then. {{delay15}}Let's hope you know what
you're doing!

---
label: Talk_0102_03
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Will do!{{delay8}} Just a moment.

---
label: Talk_0102_04
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}All right, then. {{delay8}}Let's hurry and get out of
this rain.

---
label: Talk_0103
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="Wakeup_01"}}There we go.{{delay15}}

---
label: Talk_0104
---
{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}{{anim type="CallFar_00"}}I'm in the wagon! Ready to go!

---
label: Talk_0105
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Hmmm. {{delay15}}Is it impossible{{delay8}} to {{color id="0"}}get me out of
the hole while I'm riding in the wagon{{color id="-1"}}
after all?

---
label: Talk_0111
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Yeah...you're right.{{pageBreak}}I might as well wish for my wagon to {{color id="0"}}take
to the air{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}Or for some kind of {{color id="0"}}ramp out
of the hole{{color id="-1"}} to mysteriously appear.{{pageBreak}}Either of those is as likely as the wagon
getting {{color id="0"}}lifted out{{color id="-1"}} by some invisible force.{{pageBreak}}I shouldn't go hoping for a miracle...

---
label: Talk_0121
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_01"}}Huh? The wagon's escaped without me!{{pageBreak}}If that was your doing, please {{color id="0"}}wait until
I've boarded it{{color id="-1"}}. {{delay15}}We're a team, after all!

---
label: Talk_0122
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh? {{delay15}}I can't get on the wagon like this.

---
label: Talk_0123
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Huh? {{delay15}}There's nowhere for me to sit.

---
label: Talk_0124
---
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Hmm. {{delay15}}I'm going to have a hard time
getting on the wagon.{{pageBreak}}Could you let me know when you've put
the wagon somewhere easier for me to
board it?

---
label: Talk_0201
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="QuestionNormal"}}Are you having trouble with this?{{delay8}} Would
it help if I got back out?

---
label: 0010
---
Get out.

---
label: 0011
---
Everything's fine.

---
label: Talk_0202_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Got it!{{delay8}} I'll hop back out.

---
label: Talk_0202_02
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Got it! {{delay8}}It's raining anyway. Let's start this
whole thing over.

---
label: Talk_0203
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}OK, {{delay8}}if you say so...

---
label: Talk_0252
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_01"}}Aaah! {{delay15}}Too dangerous! I'm falling out!

---
label: Talk_0281
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Hey! {{delay8}}Be more careful!{{delay8}} Ahem...and I will
pull myself together.

---
label: Talk_0039
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah! {{delay8}}Hold it! {{delay8}}I'm not so sure about this.{{pageBreak}}That wagon is important to me. Please
don't mess with it before checking first.

---
label: Talk_0039_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah! {{delay8}}Hold it! {{delay8}}Hands off the wagon, please!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I really don't want it to fall in the hole
again. {{delay15}}Leave well enough alone!

---
label: Talk_0041
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}Ah! {{delay8}}Hold it! {{delay8}}Don't take my dear, precious
wagon away from me!

---
label: Talk_0042
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Whew. {{delay8}}You had me going. {{delay8}}Seems mean to
take another fellow's precious wagon.{{pageBreak}}My wagon's not the only one who needs
to be freed from the hole. {{color id="0"}}I want to get
out too{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Talk_0043
---
{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Huh?! {{delay8}}What happened?! {{delay8}}It's on fire!

---
label: Talk_0044
---
{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Whew... {{delay8}}That was a close one. {{delay8}}Good thing
we got the fire out somehow.{{pageBreak}}Be careful handling flames around my
wagon. It's irreplaceable.

{{resetAnim arg="[11,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseM"}}Aaah! {{delay15}}My wagon!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}*sigh* {{delay8}}I'm glad we got the wagon fixed.{{pageBreak}}This wagon is very dear to me. {{delay8}}Plus it's
borrowed, so please be careful with it.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseL_00"}}Whoa! {{delay15}}I'm out of the hole?!{{playSound id="30" otherArg="0x0000"}}

{{resetAnim arg="[0,0]"}}I got so nervous, I fogged up my glasses
and missed what you did...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy_00"}}But you did it! You actually did it!{{delay15}} Thank
you so much!{{pageBreak}}If you hadn't come along, I don't know
how much longer I would have been
stuck in that hole.

---
label: Talk_0504
---
{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}Come to think of it, if I hadn't made such
a rash decision during the earliest days of
the Upheaval, and run off on my troupe...{{pageBreak}}maybe things wouldn't have ended up
like this.

---
label: Talk_0505
---
I mean, the supplies I collected to help
feed Rito Village have all spoiled by
now anyway.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I should get back to the {{color id="0"}}Stable Trotters{{color id="-1"}}
and rejoin my bandmates. That will do
more good.

---
label: Talk_0506_01
---
{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}Oh, have you not heard of us?{{delay15}}{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}Us Stable Trotters are a music troupe that
goes around stables to perform.{{pageBreak}}If I had to guess...{{delay8}}it's out of your way,
but they might be near {{color id="0"}}Woodland Stable{{color id="-1"}}
over in Eldin.

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="SurpriseS_00"}}Oh! {{delay15}}You've met the troupe leader?!{{delay15}} So the

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}After I return this wagon I borrowed, I'm
going to rejoin the troupe.{{pageBreak}}There are so many people who would
benefit from hearing us play!

---
label: Talk_0508_02

{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}For the time being, I should head to
{{color id="0"}}Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}} and play my horn for
the Great Fairy there.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_00"}}Oh!{{delay8}} One more thing!{{delay15}}


Take this, please! It's a cooking ingredient
I picked up in my travels.

This is the least I can do for you getting
me out of there.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}And now I'd better be on my way.

I look forward to playing my horn for you!

too, and hear us perform?
