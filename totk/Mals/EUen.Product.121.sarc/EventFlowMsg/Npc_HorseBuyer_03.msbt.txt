{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting"}}I have to say, the rumors don't do
{{color id="0"}}Lookout Landing {{color id="-1"}}justice! It's full of people
and waaay bigger than I expected.
{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}I'm from {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}, {{color id="0"}}east{{color id="-1"}} of {{color id="0"}}Dueling

Maybe that's why everything is so
impressive.{{delay8}} It's a totally different world.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}Leaving made me appreciate Hateno
though.{{delay8}} It's so laid-back and idyllic.
You can really relax.
Plus, {{color id="0"}}fashion{{color id="-1"}}'s become really popular
there recently. You've really got to visit!

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive"}}I'm from {{color id="0"}}Hateno Village{{color id="-1"}}, an idyllic little

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Before you buy anything, can I take a
moment to brag?

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}It's about my brother. He's becoming a
big-time chef! Isn't that exciting?

{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Though, I haven't heard from him since he
and his friends went to {{color id="0"}}Riverside Stable {{color id="-1"}}to
learn more about cooking.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}The stable's located {{color id="0"}}by a river{{color id="-1"}} on the
{{color id="0"}}southeastern {{color id="-1"}}part of Hyrule Field. Maybe
I should go and see how he's doing...

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}I really am proud of my brother for
following his passions.

{{resetAnim arg="[3,0]"}}But I miss him. He went to {{color id="0"}}Riverside

cooking and never came back.
{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}It's {{color id="0"}}by a river {{color id="-1"}}on the {{color id="0"}}southeastern {{color id="-1"}}part

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Oh, hey there! Listen up, 'cause I've got
a tip for you.

They keep {{color id="0"}}Cuccos {{color id="-1"}}at{{color id="0"}} Riverside Stable{{color id="-1"}},
which is to the east. And—here's the
tip—you can get eggs from 'em! 
All you need to do is...give 'em a

{{resetAnim arg="[1,0]"}}They call that the cluck of the draw! Hehe.

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}Rain seems to make everyone upset.
But not me!

I find the sound of it soothing. Besides,
there are some animals who only come
out when it's raining.
And the plants need that moisture!

{{resetAnim arg="[8,0]"}}{{anim type="Happy"}}What a wide-open prairie. The horses

Village {{color id="-1"}}in Necluda, {{color id="0"}}east {{color id="-1"}}of {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks{{color id="-1"}}.{{delay8}}
If for no other reason than the food!
They're most famous for fresh milk,{{delay8}}
but you haven't lived till you've tasted
their Hylian tomatoes!
If you use milk or vegetables in your
cooking, you can't go wrong with

even better if you {{color id="0"}}cook {{color id="-1"}}'em up first.

If you wanna visit Hateno for yourself,
go to {{color id="0"}}Dueling Peaks {{color id="-1"}}in Necluda, and then
head {{color id="0"}}eastward{{color id="-1"}}.
