Read Billson's records?

I'm going to keep a record of my time
working on the Skyview Tower in the
Gerudo Highlands.

Day One


We've arrived at the site and
started construction.

Unfortunately, a heavy snowstorm blew
in as soon as we started. We had to stop
and take shelter in a nearby cave.
Good news—the cave is warm and safe.
We decided to use it as our base camp
for the rest of the project.

Day Three


The cave is bigger than any of us could
have imagined.

We explored inside by following the
water downstream.

When we were deep in the cave, we heard
some hammering. I don't know how a
sound from outside made it that far down.
We will investigate tomorrow.

Day Six


Here are some highlights from the cave
investigation report.

-The cave continues all the way under the
Skyview Tower.

-The tower's weight may be a problem.
We should build a reinforcement in the
cave so it doesn't sink.

Day Ten


The tower is done! It was a breeze with
Purah's clever design and the skillful
prep work by Hudson Construction.
All of that legwork kept on-site assembly
simple and efficient.

Since we may end up using the site again,
we decided to leave some materials in
the cave.
The first thing I'll do when I get off this
mountain is have a warm bowl of soup.
