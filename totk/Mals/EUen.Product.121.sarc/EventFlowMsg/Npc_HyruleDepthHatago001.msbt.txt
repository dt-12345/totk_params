{{resetAnim arg="[7,1]"}}{{anim type="Notice_01"}}Oh,{{delay8}} hello again.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Um...{{delay8}} I wanted to say thank you for all
your help earlier.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}I was just thinking...{{delay8}} I didn't tell you
about how I met Pyper, did I?{{pageBreak}}Pyper reached out when I first showed
up looking for work.{{delay15}} He knows it can be
lonely being new.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease_01"}}He's so good at the flute, and he tells
lots of wonderful stories!{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[2,1]"}}Sometimes I have to tell him to lay off the
pranks though.{{delay8}} I mean, really...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}But...{{delay8}}I guess most of his jokes are pretty
funny. And I've never felt lonely!{{pageBreak}}*sigh*{{pageBreak}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}I love working here. Everyone is so nice.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[5,1]"}}And that's why...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}I can keep on smiling!

{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}I'm sure Pyper plans to rejoin the
musical troupe.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}Maybe I'll be a little lonelier without
him here...{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}He's always tried to keep me feeling
happy. I'll smile just thinking about that.

{{resetAnim arg="[1,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}His "glowing tree" was so beautiful.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}{{anim type="LaughS"}}That's the best gift anyone's ever given

{{resetAnim arg="[9,0]"}}Good grief!{{delay8}} Where did Pyper go?

label: Talk_1502

{{resetAnim arg="[12,0]"}}Honestly, where has Pyper run off to?

label: Talk_1503

{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="Greeting_01"}}Hey! Can you believe it...{{pageBreak}}My friend Pyper lit part of the field
outside on fire, flowers and all.{{delay8}} He's
always trying to get a laugh out of me...
{{resetAnim arg="[12,1]"}}But that wasn't funny. What was he
thinking? He said he was about to show
me a "glowing tree."{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[7,0]"}}{{anim type="TalkPositive_00"}}I mean, that sounds nice, but when I saw
what he was about to do...I told him
NOT to.
Still, he did. And THAT happened. And
now he's vanished into thin air!{{pageBreak}}Well, given it's Pyper,{{delay8}} I bet he's only
hiding somewhere, {{color id="0"}}playing his flute{{color id="-1"}}.

{{resetAnim arg="[8,1]"}}Doesn't a glowing tree sound pretty,
though? Imagine a tree twinkling away!{{pageBreak}}I've only seen one in a picture book, but
I'd like to see the real thing, even if it's
just once.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[3,1]"}}{{anim type="Ease"}}Pyper promised to show me...{{delay8}}{{pageBreak}}But then he burned down part of the
field here and ran off!{{delay15}} What got into him?

---
label: Talk_2000
---
{{resetAnim arg="[10,0]"}}Honestly...{{delay8}} Where did Pyper go?{{pageBreak}}*sigh*{{delay15}} That "glowing tree" we've been
talking about... He's probably forgotten
his promise to show me one of those.

label: Talk_2001

{{resetAnim arg="[4,0]"}}{{anim type="Notice"}}Oh!{{delay8}} Good evening.{{pageBreak}}{{resetAnim arg="[10,1]"}}Pyper isn't back, even though it's night...{{delay15}}
