A Letter to Koyin

---
label: Step01
---
Koyin, a farmer in Hateno Village, dropped a
{{color id="0"}}message bottle {{color id="-1"}}containing a letter from her
great-grandfather into a pond.

Worse still, she's not a good enough swimmer
to dive into the pond after it.

label: Step02

You retrieved the message bottle containing
a letter from Koyin's great-grandfather. After
reading it over, Koyin has big plans for the farm.

She asked you to come to the {{color id="0"}}house{{color id="-1"}} later in
order to receive your reward.

The message in the bottle described a special
cheese-making recipe. Koyin has already
decided to start marketing it as her farm's
signature product. From now on, if you bring
her fresh milk, she'll give you {{color id="0"}}Hateno cheese{{color id="-1"}}
in exchange.
