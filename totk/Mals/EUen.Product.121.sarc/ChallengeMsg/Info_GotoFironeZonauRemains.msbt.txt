Secret of the Ring Ruins

---
label: DecipherTheIithograph
---
After you told Paya and Tauro about the false
Princess Zelda, they began exploring the Ring
Ruin previously forbidden by the impostor.
They believe there is a stone slab carved with
Zonai writing inside.

{{color id="0"}}Entering the site and investigating the slab{{color id="-1"}} will
assist their research.

label: ZonauRemains_ArriveObservatory

You deciphered the Zonai text carved in the
stone slab inside the Ring Ruin. Tauro and
his colleague are following a lead to the Zonai
Ruins in balmy Faron in the southeast.

They're gathering at the {{color id="0"}}Skyview Tower near
the ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

label: ZonauRemains_TalkResearcher
---
You traveled to the Skyview Tower in the
Popla Foothills.

Calip, who industriously assembled the team's
base of operations, informed you that Tauro
planned to start investigating the Zonai Ruins
to the southeast by {{color id="0"}}Dracozu Lake{{color id="-1"}}.

label: ZonauRemains_AppearsSkyIsland
---
You reunited with Tauro in ruins presided over
by stone dragon statues. Tauro deciphered the
code found on an ancient mural in the ruins:

{{color id="0"}}Wear the electric garb hidden at long-necked
dragons along the wide-mouthed forest serpent.
Offer a Zonai charge to the altar at the tail.{{color id="-1"}}

---
label: ZonauRemains_OpenedTheDoor
---
You donned the charged attire found in the
dragon-pillar ruins and offered a Zonai charge
at the altar.

A fork of lightning heralded the appearance of
a {{color id="0"}}new sky island{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: ZonauRemains_TouchTheHead
---
You opened the door on Dragonhead Island.

Inside, you discovered what appears to be a
{{color id="0"}}Zonai relic{{color id="-1"}} on a pedestal in the center of
the chamber.

label: Complete
---
The floor of the chamber on Dragonhead Island
opened when you touched the relic. After the
relic fired a beam of green light to the ground,
you heard a mysterious voice in your head:

"Link... Chosen protector of Zelda... Take this...
Follow the light..."
