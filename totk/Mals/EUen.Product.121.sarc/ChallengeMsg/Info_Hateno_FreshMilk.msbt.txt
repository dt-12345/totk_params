Dantz's Prize Cows

---
label: Step01
---
Dantz, a farmer in Hateno Village, is looking
for {{color id="0"}}acorns{{color id="-1"}} to mix into his cows' feed so they
can produce his special fresh milk.

He says he could mix more feed if he had {{color id="0"}}three
acorns{{color id="-1"}}, but a recent boom in the squirrel
population has made them hard to come by.

You gave Dantz the acorns and he gave you
a bottle of fresh milk to express his gratitude.
If you bring him another {{color id="0"}}three acorns{{color id="-1"}}, he'd
be willing to make the same trade for more
fresh milk.
