The Missing Owner

label: Step1

Cara, the jewelry shop worker, is troubled.
It seems the shop's owner went out into the
desert to find adornments and has yet to return.

She told Cara that she would be searching the
{{color id="0"}}Toruma Dunes{{color id="-1"}}.

Isha was so focused on finding materials that
she accidentally wandered into a Molduga's
territory.

Molduga are sensitive to sound and
will devour anything they notice, so Isha can't
move even a single step.

You defeated the Molduga and rescued Isha.

She asked you to come visit her at her shop in
Gerudo Town so that she can thank you.

Cara was thrilled to see Isha again and gave
you a reward for bringing her back. It seems
like Isha has a reward for you too.

She asked you to visit her shop on the surface
when you can.
