If you wear the Zora armor, you can swim up
waterfalls. Yona is certain this will be a useful
tool for your adventure.

However, it seems an elusive fish called the
{{color id="0"}}ancient arowana {{color id="-1"}}is needed to finish repairing
the Zora armor. If you find an ancient arowana,
you should bring it to Yona.

Yona used the ancient arowana you gave her
to fix the Zora armor. With this armor, you can
climb up waterfalls.
