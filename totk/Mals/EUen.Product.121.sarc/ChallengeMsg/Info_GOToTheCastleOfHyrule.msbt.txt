At the Temple of Time, you saw the Master
Sword vanish into a mysterious light. A white
dragon then rose into the sky, parting the sea
of clouds. You're sure you heard Princess Zelda
say, "Link, you must find me." Head to the land
below to look for clues to her whereabouts.
There's no faster way to do that than to dive
bravely from the sky island.

After descending from the sky island where you
awoke, you returned to the kingdom of Hyrule
and reunited with Purah at Lookout Landing.
You learned that she's been directing search
efforts in the kingdom.

Work with Purah to find Princess Zelda.
