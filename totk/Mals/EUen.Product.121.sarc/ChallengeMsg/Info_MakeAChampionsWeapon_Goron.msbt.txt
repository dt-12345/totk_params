The art of the {{color id="0"}}Boulder Breaker{{color id="-1"}} is passed down
over generations. But Fugo, the apprentice,
gave up on making it midway and sold the
materials he was using for marbled rock roast.

To complete the Boulder Breaker and earn his
master's approval, he needs a cobble crusher,
three diamonds, and five pieces of flint.

Fugo successfully finished the Boulder Breaker
and will inherit the forge from Rohan.

If your {{color id="0"}}Boulder Breaker {{color id="-1"}}breaks, Fugo will fix it
for you.
