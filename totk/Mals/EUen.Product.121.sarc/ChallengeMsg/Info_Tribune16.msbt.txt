Serenade to a Great Fairy

---
label: Carry
---
A Great Fairy, famous for giving blessings to
travelers, has shut herself up inside her flower
bud. Penn suspects that a blond-haired
woman a musical troupe saw was Princess
Zelda, and has asked you to look into things.

It seems you'll need to {{color id="0"}}bring the musicians to
the Great Fairy {{color id="-1"}}if you want to speak with her.

Though the Great Fairy had gone into hiding
after hearing of dire things from a woman who
looked like Princess Zelda, the music of the
troupe convinced her to emerge. She didn't
think that woman was the princess, so her
identity remains a mystery. You did get two
news scoops though: the return of the Great
Fairy...and the Stable Trotters.
