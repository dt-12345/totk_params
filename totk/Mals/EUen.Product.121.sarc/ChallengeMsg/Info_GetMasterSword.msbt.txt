The darkness-sealing sword, the Master Sword,
vanished in the Temple of Time on the Great

and says that the Master Sword is {{color id="0"}}moving{{color id="-1"}}.

You found the Master Sword with the white
dragon soaring in the skies. The legendary
sword that seals the darkness has returned
to your hand, along with Zelda's wish.
