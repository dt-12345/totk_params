Misko's Cave of Chests

---
label: OpenTreasure
---
You found treasure-hunting brothers Domidak
and Prissen perplexed in front of a cave.
It seems they came seeking {{color id="0"}}Misko's treasure{{color id="-1"}}
but found more than they bargained for.

The cave has so many treasure chests that
they don't know which one holds the treasure
they seek.

You navigated the sea of treasure chests to find
the one chest that contained the real treasure.
In it, you found the ember trousers and a bottle
with a letter inside. Meanwhile, brothers
Domidak and Prissen gave up and left.
