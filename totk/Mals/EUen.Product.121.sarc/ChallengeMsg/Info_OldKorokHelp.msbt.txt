Hestu's Concerns

---
label: STEP1
---
You ran into the Korok Hestu at the foot of
Lindor's Brow. He's afraid of something and
has stopped in his tracks.

There are {{color id="0"}}trees {{color id="-1"}}where he pointed, but what
could he be so afraid of?

---
label: STEP2
---
Hestu lost the Korok seeds that were in
his maracas. It sounds like it may have been
the children of the forest who took them.

If you collect {{color id="0"}}Korok seeds{{color id="-1"}} and bring them to
Hestu, he says he will help you by expanding
your inventory.

---
label: Complete
---
You gave Hestu a {{color id="0"}}Korok seed{{color id="-1"}}. As thanks, he
sang and danced to expand your inventory.

He also told you that if you bring him more
{{color id="0"}}Korok seeds{{color id="-1"}} in the future, he will continue to
expand your inventory.
