Sidon of the Zora

---
label: MeetParkShido
---
After the Upheaval, sludge started pouring from
the sky around Zora's Domain. That foul
gunk has caused much suffering.

Yona, the Zora prince's fiancée, filled you in on
the troubles at the domain. She asked you to
meet with {{color id="0"}}Sidon {{color id="-1"}}at Mipha Court on the summit
of Ploymus Mountain. 

---
label: ResearchZora
---
You met with Sidon at Mipha Court. He has a
hunch that the cause of the sludge is in the
sky. In his search for answers, he ordered the
Zora historian Jiahto to investigate ancient
documents and the fallen ruins.

Speaking with {{color id="0"}}Jiahto{{color id="-1"}} at Toto Lake may yield
information about Princess Zelda.

---
label: InterimReportToShido
---
Speaking with Jiahto and the Zora children led
you to King Dorephan, who was injured when a
Princess Zelda look-alike loosed a monster
upon him. The phenomena troubling the Zora—
the sludge, the monster, the princess—all seem
connected to the sky.

{{color id="0"}}Sidon{{color id="-1"}} will be eager to hear this news.

---
label: InterimReportToShido_Ex
---
You encountered King Dorephan in the
Pristine Sanctum. He was injured when a
Princess Zelda look-alike loosed a monster
upon him. It seems that all of it—the sludge,
the monster, Princess Zelda—is somehow
connected to the sky.

{{color id="0"}}Sidon{{color id="-1"}} will be eager to hear this news.

---
label: FindWaterBridge
---
You relayed King Dorephan's story to Sidon.
Both Princess Zelda's trail and the destructive
sludge connect to the sky above the domain.

Your objectives align with Sidon's. If you find a
clue about the {{color id="0"}}watery bridge {{color id="-1"}}connecting the
Zora to the sky, you should let him know.

---
label: ReportToParkShido
---
A pillar of light appeared at East Reservoir Lake.
The clues you gathered from the repaired stone
slate suggest this will lead you to the
watery bridge.

{{color id="0"}}Sidon{{color id="-1"}} will want to hear about this. You can
find him at Mipha Court.

---
label: DefeatLakeBoss
---
When you told Sidon about the pillar of light
at East Reservoir Lake, a {{color id="0"}}sludge monster{{color id="-1"}}
attacked.

Work with Sidon to repel the fiend.

---
label: GoToLakeShido
---
You defeated the monster with Sidon's aid.
Yona pushed the prince to confront his fear of
loss, and he rose to the occasion. He is ready
to investigate the {{color id="0"}}watery bridge {{color id="-1"}}with you.

Sidon will wait for you near the pillar of light{{color id="0"}}{{color id="-1"}}
that appeared in East Reservoir Lake.

---
label: GoToUnderLake
---
Sidon used his impressive swimming prowess to
create a whirlpool in the lake, revealing some
kind of entrance on the lake bed.

This may lead to clues about the {{color id="0"}}watery bridge{{color id="-1"}}.
Jump into the whirlpool and investigate.

---
label: SearchRemains
---
Upon jumping into the whirlpool, you found a
vast space filled with ancient ruins.

You may find a clue about the {{color id="0"}}watery bridge{{color id="-1"}}
among them.

label: GoToBeforeDungeon
---
When you activated a mysterious device in the
Ancient Zora Waterworks, a jet of water erupted
from the ruins high above.

Even a Hylian could climb the resulting waterfall
by wearing the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoToBeforeDungeon_00
---
When you activated a mysterious device in the
Ancient Zora Waterworks, water cascaded from
the ruins high above to make a giant waterfall.

Even a Hylian can climb waterfalls by wearing
the {{color id="0"}}Zora armor{{color id="-1"}}, which Yona tasked herself
with repairing...

---
label: GoToDungeonStart
---
Resolving to explore the sky island, you arrived
at some vast ruins that may hide the answers
you seek.

Follow Sidon, who went on ahead.

---
label: TryOneTank
---
After climbing the waterfall and entering the
ruins, you found the source of the sludge
plaguing the Zora.

Sidon suggested that it may be possible to
wash away the foul substance using the
water in the enormous {{color id="0"}}water vessels{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoToBossArea
---
You poured water from the vessels on the
sludge, but it was inadequate to cleanse the
area. It seems even more water is needed.
A {{color id="0"}}mysterious voice indicated locations{{color id="-1"}} that
may be of assistance.

Work with Sidon to open all of the faucets.

---
label: DefeatBoss
---
When you washed away the sludge with the
water vessels, a monster suddenly emerged
from the muck. This must be the culprit behind
the sludge!

It's time to work with Sidon to finish this.

---
label: TouchSecretStone
---
You combined forces with Sidon to defeat the
monster producing the sludge. What remained
of the substance dispersed, taking the threat to
the Zora along with it.

Sidon was left gazing at the strange stone that
appeared when the sludge vanished.

---
label: Complete
---
With the defeat of the fiend responsible for
the sludge, the trouble afflicting the region
was resolved. At the same time, Sidon
awakened as a sage.

He promised to rally the domain to assist you,
declaring that it's now the Zora's turn to help
their hero.
