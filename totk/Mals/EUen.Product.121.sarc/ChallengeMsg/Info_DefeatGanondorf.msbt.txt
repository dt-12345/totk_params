Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, and Spirit.
The five sages have awakened and entrusted
you with their power. You still don't know where

you might gain a lead.

Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, and Spirit. The five
sages have awakened and entrusted you with
their power. You also determined the Demon
King's location during The Depths investigation.

All that's left now is to head to the deepest
area of the Depths beneath Hyrule Castle and
defeat Demon King Ganondorf.
