It seems Manny's friend's friend badly wants
to catch the eye of {{color id="0"}}Ivee{{color id="-1"}}, the greeter for the
general store.

Can you muster the courage to ask Ivee what
she likes the most?

It turns out that what Ivee wants the most in
life is 100 {{color id="0"}}hot-footed frogs{{color id="-1"}}.

You should break the news to {{color id="0"}}Manny{{color id="-1"}}.

Upon learning that Ivee wants a collection of
100 hot-footed frogs, Manny enlisted your
help as a frog catcher.

Start by collecting {{color id="0"}}10 hot-footed frogs{{color id="-1"}}, which
can be found in wells and caves. One such
well in the village is home to many frogs.

label: Complete

You delivered the 10 hot-footed frogs to
Manny and received a reward.

Manny confessed that he was the one who
wanted to catch Ivee's eye. His plan now is to
find the remaining hot-footed frogs on his own.
