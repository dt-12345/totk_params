Mattison's Independence

---
label: Research
---
Hudson and Rhondson of Hudson Construction
were discussing the pending departure of
someone named Mattison. Rhondson seemed
upbeat about it, but {{color id="0"}}Hudson{{color id="-1"}} looked sad.

He appears to be worried about something.

label: Child_Talk
---
It seems Hudson's only daughter, Mattison,
is moving to Gerudo Town on her own in
accordance with Gerudo law.

Both Hudson and Rhondson regret that they
are too busy to {{color id="0"}}play with Mattison{{color id="-1"}}, especially
since it won't be long before she leaves.

label: Quiz2
---
Hudson and Rhondson's daughter, Mattison, is
studying the Gerudo language in preparation for
her move.

She's going to find {{color id="0"}}Granny Monari{{color id="-1"}}, and said
something about giving her a quiz...

Mattison has been teaching the Gerudo
language to the people of Tarrey Town so that
her mother, Rhondson, won't feel so lonely.

Now she's headed toward the {{color id="0"}}railcar{{color id="-1"}}. She
wants to help her father, Hudson, who's been
very busy with work.

Mattison wants to go to the job site to
help Hudson with his work—but Hagie,
who's in charge of the railcar that
extends to the site, is charging a toll.

Mattison doesn't have any money and
is, instead, trying to figure out a way to
{{color id="0"}}obscure Hagie's line of sight{{color id="-1"}}.

label: MammyReport

Mattison managed to evade Hagie and ride 
the railcar. Was she was able to meet up
with Hudson at the worksite?

label: PaPaTalk
---
Hudson is trying to make a balloon for
Mattison to help his daughter's departure feel
like a grand celebration.

He needs {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="IchikaraChallenge01_HidamariNum" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} sundelions{{color id="-1"}} so he can dye it
yellow—Mattison's favorite color.

label: Complete

Along with Rhondson, Hudson, and the people
of Tarrey Town, you saw Mattison off on her
journey to Gerudo Town.

If you go to Gerudo Town, perhaps you can see
Mattison again.
