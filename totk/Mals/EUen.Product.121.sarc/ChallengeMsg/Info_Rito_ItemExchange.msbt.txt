Bedoli is struggling due to the lack of food
around Rito Village. She's offered you a trade:
bring her {{color id="0"}}three glowing cave fish, which can be
caught in caves{{color id="-1"}}, and she'll give you 10 arrows.

It couldn't hurt to keep an eye out for the fish
during your travels.

You gave Bedoli three glowing cave fish and
received 10 arrows in return. She offered to
expand the agreement as well—now she'll offer
arrows not just for glowing cave fish, but also
for the {{color id="0"}}chillfin trout and brightcaps {{color id="-1"}}that the Rito
children crave.
