Seeking the Pirate Hideout

---
label: Step1
---
You met Sesami of the monster-control crew on
Eventide Island in Hyrule's southeastern sea.

He was sent to scout out a pirate hideout, but
the {{color id="0"}}three monster strongholds {{color id="-1"}}on the island are
hindering his progress.

---
label: Step2
---
You cleared out one of the three monster
strongholds on Eventide Island.

{{color id="0"}}Two{{color id="-1"}} strongholds remain.

---
label: Step3
---
You cleared out two of the three monster
strongholds on Eventide Island.

{{color id="0"}}One{{color id="-1"}} stronghold remains.

---
label: Step4
---
You cleared out all three monster strongholds
on Eventide Island.

You should inform {{color id="0"}}Sesami{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: Step5
---
Sesami told you that he saw a pirate ship
returning to Eventide Island. Apparently the
pirate ship went around the {{color id="0"}}back of the island{{color id="-1"}}
and then vanished.

Could that be the pirate hideout's location?

label: Step6
---
The pirates were hiding out and mooring their
ship in a cave in the back of Eventide Island.

If you {{color id="0"}}clear the hideout of the pirate monsters{{color id="-1"}},
you might be able to save the people they've
been tormenting.

label: Step7

The pirates were hiding out and mooring their
ship in a cave in the back of Eventide Island.

Go tell {{color id="0"}}Sesami {{color id="-1"}}of the monster-control crew that
you were able to wipe out the pirate monsters
in their hideout.

The pirates were hiding out and mooring their

Sesami was grateful to you for locating the
hideout and clearing it of pirate monsters.
