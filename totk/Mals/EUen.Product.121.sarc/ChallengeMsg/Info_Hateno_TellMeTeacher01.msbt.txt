Symin's students didn't put much stock in the
story of the Calamity. He thinks that if he could
show them an {{color id="0"}}elaborate picture {{color id="-1"}}of the screen
depicting the Calamity, they would believe his
history lesson.

The screen in question is kept at Paya's Hall
in Kakariko Village.
