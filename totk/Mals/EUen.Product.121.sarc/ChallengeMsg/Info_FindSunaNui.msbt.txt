Dalia's Game

---
label: SetUp
---
The orb that Dalia calls her "treasure" appeared
from under the sands after the sand shroud
dissipated. Dalia said she'd lend it to you if you
can beat her at her own game.

Ask her about it when she seems to have some
free time.

label: Playing
---
You accepted Dalia's challenge!

If you can find the stuffed sand seal hidden in
the shelter before time runs out, you win.

---
label: Complete
---
You challenged Dalia and won! She is willing to
let you use her treasured orb anytime you like.

In addition, you can challenge her at her game
as many times as you want from now on, as
long as she isn't busy.
