label: Step01

Mubs and Garini's hometown, Lurelin Village,
was attacked by pirates. The village is at the
edge of East Necluda in the southeast. There
are no neighboring villages to flee to, so they're
concerned about the safety of the villagers. 

If you find {{color id="0"}}Rozel{{color id="-1"}}, the head of the village, he
should know more.

Rozel, the head of Lurelin Village, let you know
about the villagers. It turns out that although
the village was attacked by pirates, everyone
was able to flee to safety. You should let Mubs
and Garini at Lookout Landing know.
