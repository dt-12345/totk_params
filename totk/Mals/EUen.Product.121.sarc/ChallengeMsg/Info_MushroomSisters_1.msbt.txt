You gave Nat 10 brightcaps and learned that
she and her sister, Meghyn, are on a journey
looking for..."that." They wouldn't tell you what
"that" is, but said they would let you in on the
secret if you meet again. It sounds like they're
going to {{color id="0"}}northern Hebra{{color id="-1"}} next.
