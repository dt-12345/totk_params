The Great Tumbleweed Purge

---
label: Step1
---
Barles is trying to clean up a mountain of
garbage but can't cope with a large number
of tumbleweeds that have blown in. She's
tried to dispose of them one by one, but
they just keep rolling back.

If she could only get rid of the tumbleweeds,
then she'd make some progress on cleaning.

label: Report
---
You cleaned up all of the tumbleweeds for
Barles. She wanted to give you a reward
for your trouble, but your pouch was full.

Make some room in order to accept her gift.

You cleaned up the tumbleweeds that were
piling up in the mountain of garbage. After
they were gone, Barles gave you her thanks
and was eager to take on cleaning up the
garbage pile...somehow.
