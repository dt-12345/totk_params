adventurous qualities, she's on her way to see
the {{color id="0"}}fossil of an extinct leviathan in Eldin{{color id="-1"}}.

You went to the Eldin Great Skeleton only to
discover that one of the leviathan's eyeballs
was missing.

Loone is forlorn, wishing she could {{color id="0"}}see the
leviathan with both eyes intact{{color id="-1"}}.

You restored the Eldin Great Skeleton's missing
eyeball, and Loone couldn't have been happier.
After gazing at your handiwork for a while,
Loone told you that her next stop is the
leviathan fossil in Hebra.
