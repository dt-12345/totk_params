Aya is worried that a group of monsters at
North Akkala Beach may come threaten
the stable.

It seems like she won't really feel safe until
every last one of the monsters has been
dealt with.

You defeated every last one of the monsters
staying at North Akkala Beach.

Return to East Akkala Stable and let Aya know
that the monsters are gone.

Aya seemed relieved to learn that the monsters
staying at North Akkala Beach had been dealt
with. Hopefully the workers at the stable will
be able to relax now.
