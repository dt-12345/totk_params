Piaffe, the owner of Gerudo Canyon Stable,
wants to decorate the establishment with a
painting of a giant sword, which is said to be
found in the Gerudo Highlands.

Maybe there's a way to take a picture of it and
show it to Piaffe.

is pleased to have a picture of the Forgotten
Sword hung on the wall of the stable.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different

image and he'll make a copy to put on display.
