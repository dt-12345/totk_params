The sludge is gone and Bazz is safe. Overjoyed
at his newfound freedom, he offered to give you
a Zora spear.

Make room in your weapon collection, and talk

Bazz got sludge in his gills and was suffering so
much he couldn't move. Now that the sludge is
gone, he's safe.

You received a Zora spear as a thank-you gift.
