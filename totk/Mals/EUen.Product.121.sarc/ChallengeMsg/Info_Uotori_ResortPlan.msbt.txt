Lurelin Resort Project

label: Contact

Rozel, head of Lurelin Village, and Bolson,
the architect, are planning to build a new
entertainment facility so they can host a
rally race on the water at the village.

They wonder if they might be able to invite
some {{color id="0"}}racing professionals{{color id="-1"}} to make the journey
from Tarrey Town to Lurelin Village.

You told Tali, Shabonne, and Fernison about
Lurelin Village's water rally project. Fernison
said she'd be happy to send Tali and Shabonne
to help, but first she needs someone to break
Tali's{{color id="0"}} record {{color id="-1"}}so she can {{color id="0"}}capture the race data{{color id="-1"}}. 

When you're ready, talk to Fernison and try
the Tarrey Town Race.

You broke Tali's course record, so she and
Shabonne agreed to head to Lurelin Village.

This should help Rozel and Bolson make
progress on the water rally course they're
hoping to build.

With Tali and Shabonne's help, the water rally
course was completed in no time. Talk to
Bolson when you want to put your skills to
the test in the {{color id="0"}}Lurelin Water Rally{{color id="-1"}}.
