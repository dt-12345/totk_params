The Iceless Icehouse

---
label: Step1
---
Anche, who runs the icehouse, is having a
problem. The temperatures in the desert have
risen high enough that it's nearly impossible for
ice to form.

Anche is busy trying to figure out how to
{{color id="0"}}make ice{{color id="-1"}}.

label: Step2

You were able to make some ice, but it turns
out the ice must be as wide as the alcove.

Anche has asked you to adjust the size of the
ice and {{color id="0"}}place it in the alcove{{color id="-1"}}.

You gave Anche the ice she asked for, and she
let you know that you can always come back
and keep helping her since she'll probably
need more ice at least once a day. She'll even
prepare some {{color id="0"}}rewards{{color id="-1"}} for you as thanks for
your help.
