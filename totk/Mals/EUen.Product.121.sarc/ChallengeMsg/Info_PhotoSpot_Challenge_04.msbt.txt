A Picture for Outskirt Stable

label: Step01

Embry, the owner of Outskirt Stable, wants
to hang a picture of a special, mystical
cherry-blossom tree that can be found on
Satori Mountain, {{color id="0"}}northwest{{color id="-1"}} of the stable.

Maybe there's a way to take a picture of it and
show it to Embry.

Embry, the owner of Outskirt Stable, is pleased
to have a painting of the cherry-blossom tree
hung up at his establishment.

He was going to give you a reward, but your
inventory was full. Be sure to trim your
belongings before you accept his gift.

Embry, the owner of Outskirt Stable, is pleased
to have a painting of the cherry-blossom tree
hung up at his establishment.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different
picture of the tree. Just show him a new image 
and he'll make a copy to put on display.
