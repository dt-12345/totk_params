A priceless stone tablet engraved with ancient
Hyrulean text has fallen from the sky into
Lookout Landing. Wortsworth, a scholar of
ancient Hyrulean, said he intends to decipher
the text by comparing it to ancient documents
left at the lab in Kakariko Village.

He's departed for the village in the southeast.

It's become clear that there are 13 stone
tablets documenting the age of legends. By
deciphering all of them, one could learn about
the lives of the royal family of that era, which
was not documented in any history book.
Capture the stone tablets in {{color id="0"}}pictures{{color id="-1"}},{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}and show
them to Wortsworth in Kakariko Village. You still
need to capture {{number14 ref="Num_ZonauReliefSearch" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}}{{pluralCase arg1=" stone tablet" arg2=" stone tablets" arg3=""}}.
