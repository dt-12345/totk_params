Dabi, the owner of Tabantha Bridge Stable, 
wants to decorate his establishment with a
painting of the Ancient Columns at sunrise.
The columns can be found on {{color id="0"}}the top of the
cliff across Tabantha Great Bridge{{color id="-1"}}.

Maybe there's a way to take a picture of them
and show it to Dabi.

is pleased to have a painting of the
Ancient Columns at sunrise hanging
in his establishment.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different
picture of the same scenery. Just show him a
new image and he'll make a copy to display.
