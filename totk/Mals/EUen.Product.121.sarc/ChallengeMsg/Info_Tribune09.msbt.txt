Penn's research at Snowfield Stable turned up
a story about Princess Zelda's golden horse,
which has a mane braided with honeycomb
plaits. It was being kept there but {{color id="0"}}ran off{{color id="-1"}}
somewhere {{color id="0"}}to the north{{color id="-1"}}.

Harlow can't go look for the horse, given that a
huge monster is apparently in the snow fields.

You found the golden horse, and Harlow was
beside herself when you returned the gentle
creature to the stable. She asked you to take
the horse, as it already seems attached to you.
Penn flew off to write the whole story up for the
newspaper.
