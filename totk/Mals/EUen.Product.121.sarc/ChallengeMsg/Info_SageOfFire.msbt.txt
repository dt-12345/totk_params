Yunobo of Goron City

---
label: Dream
---
Many of the Gorons in Goron City are
ravenously eating marbled rock roast. Yunobo
and a {{color id="0"}}blond woman {{color id="-1"}}seem to be involved with
this new rock.

Yunobo and the others are now headed for
YunoboCo HQ to look into some marbled
rock roast business.

---
label: GoCrater
---
Yunobo came back to his senses. Working 
together, everyone safely escaped the cave.

If you go to {{color id="0"}}Death Mountain{{color id="-1"}}, where Princess
Zelda and Yunobo last met, you may be
able to find a lead.

label: DefeatBossMiddle
---
Just as you caught sight of Zelda at
Death Mountain's crater, a massive {{color id="0"}}red rock
monster {{color id="-1"}}appeared from the crater, blocking
your entry.

In order to follow after Zelda, you must defeat
the monster.

---
label: GoMinusField
---
You defeated the monster that emerged from
Death Mountain's crater, but Princess Zelda
was nowhere to be seen. Worried that she may
have fallen into the caldera, Yunobo dove into
the crater.

---
label: GoEntranceDungeon
---
An area flowing with lava is at the bottom of
the crater. While taking it all in, you heard a
mysterious voice call to you, saying, "Come."

A large structure stands in the distance.
The voice sounded like it was coming from
that direction.

---
label: GoDungeon
---
Guided by a mysterious voice, you arrived at a
massive structure.

You spotted Princess Zelda again before losing
sight of her near the entrance.

---
label: Dungeon
---
Princess Zelda was sucked into the ceiling
along with the red rocks, and the area is
blocked by iron bars.

If you go to the five places indicated by the
mysterious voice, you may be able to clear
the way.

---
label: StartBossBattle
---
With Yunobo's assistance, you successfully
unlocked the five locks.

The room where you saw Princess Zelda is
now accessible.

---
label: DefeatBoss
---
Upon destroying the red rock in the ceiling in an
attempt to rescue Zelda, a large four-legged
monster appeared.

It seems the monster's body is covered in the
same {{color id="0"}}red rocks{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: TouchSecretStone
---
You defeated the four-legged monster, but
Princess Zelda was nowhere to be seen.
Shortly afterward, however, a sparkling stone
fell from the ceiling.

Yunobo is looking at it with wonder.

---
label: Complete
---
Upon returning to Goron City, you found that
the marbled rock roast had vanished, and the
Gorons had resumed their usual activities.

Yunobo awakened as the Sage of Fire and is
excited to help you. He has pledged to continue
looking for clues about Princess Zelda.
