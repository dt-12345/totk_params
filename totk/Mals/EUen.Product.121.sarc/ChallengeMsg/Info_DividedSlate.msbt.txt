When you spoke with the historian Jiahto, he
told you he discovered an old Zora slate.
There is information related to the sky written
there, but the {{color id="0"}}slate {{color id="-1"}}is broken and the full
meaning is unclear.

This could be a clue to finding Princess Zelda.

It reads: "Stand upon the land of the sky fish,
and behold its lofty view. Among the floating
rocks you see, a droplet waits for you. Through
this droplet, shoot an arrow with the mark of the
king. Do this task, and you shall reveal a most
wondrous thing. See the watery bridge's resting
spot with your own two eyes...that which
connects the Zora to the people of the skies."
