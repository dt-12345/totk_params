The Bedrock Bistro is running low on rock roast
and is having trouble maintaining a steady
supply for their Goron clientele.

roast, {{color id="0"}}he'll treat you to a special dish{{color id="-1"}}.

wasn't able to give you his special {{color id="0"}}dish{{color id="-1"}}
because your pouch was full.

Chef Cooke.

You gave Chef Cooke a rock roast, and he
gave you {{color id="0"}}seared gourmet steak{{color id="-1"}}, his special
dish. He said because they are always running
low on rock roast, he's willing to take more from
you, his new supplier, from now on.
