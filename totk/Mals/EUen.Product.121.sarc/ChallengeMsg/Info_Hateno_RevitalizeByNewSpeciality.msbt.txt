A New Signature Food

---
label: Step01

Reede wants to make the food that his
grandfather created with another villager into
a new village staple. However, all he remembers
about it is its {{color id="0"}}creamy, melty {{color id="-1"}}mouthfeel and its
unique, pungent aroma.

Reede thinks smelling that aroma again might
jog his memory.

It seems Reede's grandfather had worked with
another villager to make Hateno cheese.
Convinced it will seal his victory in the mayoral
election, Reede decides to market it as Hateno
Village's new signature staple. From now on,
you can buy Hateno cheese not just at Hateno
Pasture but also at Hateno Village's general
store and from merchants on the roads.
