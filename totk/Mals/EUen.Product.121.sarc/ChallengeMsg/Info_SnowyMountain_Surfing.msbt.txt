At the Spring of Wisdom near the summit of
Mount Lanayru, Nazbi told you this legend:
"{{color id="0"}}Skim across snow, from the spring high in the
heavens to the mountain below. Pass through
the rings of light to see the Light of Blessing.{{color id="-1"}}"

"Skim across snow, from the spring high in the
heavens to the mountain below. Pass through
the rings of light to see the Light of Blessing."
You jumped from the sky island springs above
Mount Lanayru, went through the rings of light
toward the ground, and at the end of it all,
a Shrine of Light appeared.
