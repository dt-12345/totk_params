The White Bird's Guidance

Laissa, a resident of Rito Village, can't seem to
recall the location of a cave she found a while
back. Apparently the cave contained a rock
matching the {{color id="0"}}one wreathed in green light{{color id="-1"}}
beneath the village's general store.

If you ask Laissa again, she may have more
information that could lead you to the cave.

Laissa, a resident of Rito Village, can't seem
to recall the location of a cave she found a
while back. When you asked what she could
remember about it, she said that she saw a
white bird sitting atop the shadow of Vah
Medoh's perch at early morning. When she tried
to go after it, the bird was gone, and in its place
was the entrance to the {{color id="0"}}cave{{color id="-1"}}.

You found the cave entrance that had slipped
from Laissa's memory. It seems that the spot
was marked by a patch of snow in the shape of
a bird, found atop the tip of the shadow of Vah
Medoh's perch at early morning.

Inside the cave, you found a Shrine of Light.
