Find Princess Zelda

label: GetZonauMajic

You found yourself on a strange island in the
sky after you awoke. A steward construct
claimed that Princess Zelda gave it her
Purah Pad, all to get it into your hands.

The device's {{color id="0"}}map {{color id="-1"}}shows a yellow point of
light. The construct said that's where you'll
find the princess.

In the Temple of Time, you approached
an altar, and in a flash of light, you found
yourself with Princess Zelda. That is, with
some phantasmal floating vision of her.

She took your hand and gave you an ability
to control time that's known as Recall. Now,
the temple's deeper mysteries await you.

Rauru said you can't open the door at the back
of the temple because you're still too weak.

You need to get one more {{color id="0"}}Light of Blessing {{color id="-1"}}at
the island's final shrine to offer at the
Goddess Statue. The shrine is marked by a
bright dot on the {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}. You can go near there
instantly with the Purah Pad's {{color id="0"}}travel {{color id="-1"}}feature.

After going to the final shrine that Rauru
told you about, you now have four
{{color id="0"}}Lights of Blessing{{color id="-1"}}. 

If you offer them at the {{color id="0"}}Goddess Statue{{color id="-1"}} in the
temple, you may regain enough strength to
take on the door's test of vitality.

After you offered four Lights of Blessing, the
Goddess Statue purged gloom from your body.
You're far from being restored to your former
full vitality, but it was enough to open the door.
Rauru said he'd done all he could for Zelda and
that now it was up to you. He then vanished,
leaving you alone with the temple's final altar.
Perhaps his parting words will soon be clear.

You didn't find Princess Zelda on the sky
island where you awoke. When you touched the
light in the Temple of Time, you felt her
presence, however faintly, as a voice rang out
in your mind: "{{color id="0"}}Link, you must find me.{{color id="-1"}}"

Where is Princess Zelda? Was there anything
more she was trying to tell you?
