A Picture for Foothill Stable

label: Step01

Ozunda, the owner of Foothill Stable, wants
to hang a painting of the Daruk sculpture that
overlooks {{color id="0"}}Goron City{{color id="-1"}}, northwest of the stable.

Maybe there's a way to take a picture of it and
show it to Ozunda.

Ozunda, the owner of Foothill Stable, is
pleased to have a painting of the Daruk
sculpture hanging on the wall of his
establishment.

He was going to give you a reward, but your
inventory was full. Be sure to trim your

Ozunda, the owner of Foothill Stable, is
pleased to have a painting of the Daruk
sculpture hanging on the wall of his
establishment.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different
painting of the sculpture. Just show him a new
image and he'll make a copy to put on display.
