Guidance from Ages Past

You found a strange relic on Dragonhead Island
that emitted a narrow beam of light. The beam
appears to extend straight down to the surface.

When you touched the relic, a mysterious voice
said to take it and "{{color id="0"}}follow the light{{color id="-1"}}."

---
label: CarryHead_CheckPoint02
---
The relic's light guided you to a hidden path
that led underground.

From there, the relic started emitting the beam
again, leading you down the path.

label: CarryHead_CheckPoint04
---
When you placed the relic on a pedestal in the
underground chamber, a path opened into the
Depths. The mysterious voice spoke again,
saying, "You must hurry... We must meet as
soon as possible." When you arrived in a vast
space within the Depths, the relic began to emit
another beam to guide you toward the {{color id="0"}}ruins{{color id="-1"}}.

Within the vast ruins was a pedestal with a
hollow carved out in the shape of a person.
When you placed the relic where the head
would go, the voice spoke again. Calling herself
Mineru, the Sage of Spirit, she asked you to
visit four depots for the parts to {{color id="0"}}build a body
that could house her spirit{{color id="-1"}}, allowing you to truly
meet her.

label: Dungeon_DuringDungeonCapture
---
When you placed the parts collected from the
four depots in the pedestal, they connected and
came to life as a large construct. Mineru's voice
then asked you to bring her to the {{color id="0"}}secret stone
of spirit{{color id="-1"}} using the power of the construct.

From Mineru's voice, you learned the location
of the secret stone.

---
label: Dungeon_BeforeBossBattle
---
Alongside the construct, you headed to the
Temple of Spirit, where the secret stone is
housed. Another construct, animated by the
Demon King's magic, awaited you there.

You must vanquish this construct to claim the
secret stone of spirit.

---
label: Dungeon_DefeatedBoss
---
You vanquished the construct animated by the
Demon King's magic. The remains of that
construct, built by Mineru long ago, vanished
along with the gloom filling the temple.

The {{color id="0"}}secret stone of spirit{{color id="-1"}} sparkles atop
the altar.

At last you met the voice's owner, Mineru, the
Sage of Spirit. She transferred her spirit from
the Purah Pad, where it had resided, into the
secret stone. She told you of a battle with the
Demon King in the distant past, known as the
Imprisoning War, and of Princess Zelda's
resolve to restore the Master Sword. Mineru's
spirit will aid you in the construct she inhabits.
