Reede's Secret

---
label: Step01
---
Every evening, Reede shuts himself up in the
{{color id="0"}}shed at his house{{color id="-1"}}. His wife, Clavia, is getting
suspicious of his behavior. She's asked you to
go into the {{color id="0"}}shed{{color id="-1"}} in the middle of the day while
Reede isn't there and look around.

The shed is normally locked and can't be
entered through the door.

You learned a few things from the journal found
in the shed: Reede is developing a new
type of vegetable with Nack, he's trying to
incorporate elements from the Cece clothing
line, and his efforts haven't come to
anything yet.

Report back to the worried Clavia.

findings, she was relieved but also irked by
Reede's stubbornness.
