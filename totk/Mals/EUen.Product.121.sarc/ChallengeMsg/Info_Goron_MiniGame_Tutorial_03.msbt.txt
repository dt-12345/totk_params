You cleared the high-difficulty Death Mountain
course! Kabetta gave you some fabric to
reward you for clearing all of Mine-Cart Land.
He said you can make it into something at
Hateno Village in southeast Hyrule.

He also said Mine-Cart Land is still accepting
challengers if you want to play again.
