Follow the Cuccos

Trissa is at a loss. The local Cuccos are nesting
somewhere new, and she cannot gather any
bird eggs for her shop. She says she'd like to
have 10, since they're such a popular item.

It seems the Cuccos all go off somewhere when
{{color id="0"}}morning{{color id="-1"}} comes.

You gave 10 bird eggs to Trissa for her shop,
and she paid you back at above-normal prices!
Those eggs should allow her to stay stocked for
a while.
