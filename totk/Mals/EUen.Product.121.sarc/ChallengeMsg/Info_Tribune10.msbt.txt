The All-Clucking Cucco

---
label: TalkKokkko
---
Penn scoured near South Akkala Stable for
news leads but couldn't find any. He thought
it'd possibly be a good idea to ask a {{color id="0"}}Cucco
who speaks prophecy {{color id="-1"}}for leads.

The bird is on the hill behind the stable, under
a large tree.

You went to a hill near South Akkala Stable,
where a Cucco who talks—and speaks
prophecy—actually exists.

It said that if you {{color id="0"}}faced some trials{{color id="-1"}}, it would
somehow lead to more information about
Princess Zelda.

label: FinishFirstTrial
---
You agreed to face the first trial that the
prophecy-speaking Cucco put before you. Yet,
after you succeeded, it said you had to face
a {{color id="0"}}second trial{{color id="-1"}}.

If you do that one, you'll finally get that
information about Princess Zelda.

label: SecondOracle

After you completed the first trial, the
prophecy-speaking Cucco said that you had
to face a {{color id="0"}}second trial{{color id="-1"}}. You agreed, and now
must complete it.

If you do, you'll finally get that information
about Princess Zelda.

label: Battle
---
You completed the trials that the
prophecy-speaking Cucco put before you,
only to learn it was a {{color id="0"}}Yiga trap{{color id="-1"}}. They
wanted to exhaust you with needless
work—and then attack!

The prophecy-speaking Cucco was a ruse
created by the Yiga Clan to lure you to your
doom. When Penn heard your report, he said
it'd all make a great story for the newspaper.
He's going to write about what happened
to warn readers about false oracles.
