Dyeing to Find It

Near some ruins on Quatta's Shelf, northwest
of Mount Lanayru, a Steward Construct said
this riddle would guide you to a sacred shrine:

"{{color id="0"}}When the sun awakens in the sky, dye the
white pattern black. Then will the sacred
shrine appear.{{color id="-1"}}"

By reorienting the mechanism in the ruins
to receive the morning light, you lined up its
shadow to cover the white symbol.

A Shrine of Light appeared in the ruins.
