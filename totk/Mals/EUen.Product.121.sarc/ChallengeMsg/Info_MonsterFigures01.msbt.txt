Kilton wants Hudson to craft a sculpture that
looks like a Bokoblin for him, but he's finding it
difficult to describe what a Bokoblin looks like.

Hudson explained that he'd have no problem
making the sculpture if he had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}}
of the monster to look at for reference.

You showed Hudson a picture of a Bokoblin,
and he made a sculpture from it. Now Kilton
would like that sculpture moved to a stage.

Let Kilton know once you have {{color id="0"}}placed it on
the stage{{color id="-1"}}.

The Bokoblin sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

Now he wants to give you a reward for all your
help. Be sure to make room for Kilton's present
among your belongings, and then go see him.

The Bokoblin sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

It's been a dream of Kilton's to teach folks
about monsters and help them see that they
have good traits too. He's thrilled to be on
his way toward making that dream a reality.
