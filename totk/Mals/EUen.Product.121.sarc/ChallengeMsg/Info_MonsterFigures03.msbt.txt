The Battle Talus sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

Now he wants to give you a reward for all your
help. Be sure to make room for Kilton's present

The Battle Talus sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

It's been a dream of Kilton's to teach folks
about the good side of monsters, so he's
thrilled to be one step closer to making that
dream a reality.
