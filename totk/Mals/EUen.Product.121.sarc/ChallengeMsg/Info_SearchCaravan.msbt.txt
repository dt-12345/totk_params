Lost in the Dunes

label: Step1

Ponthos, a bushy-bearded caravan traveler,
went out through the west entrance and hasn't
returned yet. Standard caravan practice is to
wait in a {{color id="0"}}conspicuous location{{color id="-1"}}—near a tall
structure, for example—when lost in the desert.

But since a sinkhole is also in this area, finding
Ponthos isn't going to be easy.

label: Step1a

You found the caravan traveler, Ponthos,
stuck below the sinkhole.

There doesn't seem to be an {{color id="0"}}exit{{color id="-1"}}, and Ponthos
is just about ready to give up.

You smashed through some rocks and made a
passageway to a ladder leading to the surface.
Ponthos climbed the ladder and headed back to
his worried friends.

He said something about a reward waiting for
you at {{color id="0"}}Kara Kara Bazaar{{color id="-1"}}.

You rescued Ponthos, a missing caravan
traveler, from the sinkhole. As a reward, he
gave you his prized orb. He said there is
someone in Gerudo Town who knows more
about the orb.
