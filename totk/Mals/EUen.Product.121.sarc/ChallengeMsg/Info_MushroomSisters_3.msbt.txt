After searching the deepest reaches of Sturnida
Springs Cave, you found the mushroom haven
that Nat and Meghyn were looking for.

The pair are happy with themselves for finding
the place, but a bit vexed you found it first.
Having achieved their goal, they've set off to
search for more mushrooms.
