Verla came to Talonto Peak Cave to collect {{color id="0"}}10{{color id="-1"}}
{{color id="0"}}chillshrooms{{color id="-1"}}, only to find that cold water had
accumulated inside.

With his wing still injured from a fight with
monsters, Verla has no way to cross the pool.

When you gave Verla the 10 chillshrooms, he
gave you a purple rupee as a reward. Verla was
relieved to be able to return to the village with
head held high.
