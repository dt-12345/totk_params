Piaffe, Packed Away

label: Step1
---
Gerudo Canyon Stable is being shut down
after the abnormal weather dried up their
supply of customers.

Unfortunately for Piaffe, the building is packed
full of rubbish and he can't bring himself to
clean it all up. It's a tough situation to be in
when he's supposed to {{color id="0"}}dispose of it all{{color id="-1"}}.

Piaffe offered you a {{color id="0"}}Pony Point{{color id="-1"}} as thanks for
helping clean up the stable.

However, because Gerudo Canyon Stable is
officially shut down, you'll need to register as
a stable member somewhere else.

You tidied the clutter filling up the stable.
Now Gerudo Canyon Stable can finally close its
doors once and for all. Piaffe was appreciative,
but he also seemed a little sad...
