You met Loone near East Akkala Stable. She
loves things that exude ancient mystique and
is en route to see the {{color id="0"}}fossil of a third extinct
leviathan in the Gerudo region{{color id="-1"}}.

You went to the Gerudo Great Skeleton and
discovered the skull of a baby leviathan next to
its parent leviathan's fossil.

Loone laments that it's incomplete and wants
to see the {{color id="0"}}parent and child leviathans side
by side{{color id="-1"}}. She thinks that the child's tail and
torso must be nearby...

You collected the pieces of the baby leviathan
fossil and assembled it in its rightful place at the
Gerudo Great Skeleton. Loone was overjoyed
to see the mother and child leviathans side by
side. Now that she's visited every leviathan
fossil, Loone seems content at last.
