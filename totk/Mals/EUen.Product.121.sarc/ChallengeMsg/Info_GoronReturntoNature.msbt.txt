Moon-Gazing Gorons

Volcon and Tray want to go moon-gazing. They
spoke of a place where you can see the full
moon shining on the ground at midday, but they
can't recall how to get there. They only know
that it is at Lake Ferona in Eldin Canyon.

They might recall if they had a {{color id="0"}}picture of the
full moon shining on the ground {{color id="-1"}}during daylight.

When Volcon and Tray saw the picture, they
were able to recall the location where the full
moon shines during daylight. They felt better
and were happy to recall the memory of
that place.
