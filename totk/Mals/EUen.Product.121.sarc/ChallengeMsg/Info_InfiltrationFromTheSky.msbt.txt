Maca's Special Place

---
label: Step01
---
Maca told you about his special place, but it's
shrouded in the lost fog, and it seems that only
Koroks can walk there.

There's some sort of green swirl there, and you
can see a floating island in the sky from there
as well. Maca wonders whether {{color id="0"}}the inside of the
forest could also be seen from the sky{{color id="-1"}}.

You were able to reach the shrine in the forest
by passing through an opening in the sky above
the Lost Woods.
