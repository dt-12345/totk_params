You collected a swallow bow, five bundles of
wood, and three diamonds and brought them
all to Teba. As promised, he crafted a Great
Eagle Bow with them and gave it to you.

If your {{color id="0"}}Great Eagle Bow{{color id="-1"}} breaks, he can remake
it so long as you collect the materials again.
