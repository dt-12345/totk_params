Camera Work in the Depths

Josha showed you an {{color id="0"}}image of a figure{{color id="-1"}} on a
piece of slate from {{color id="0"}}the Depths{{color id="-1"}}. She thinks it's
evidence of a people that once lived there.
Robbie said he'd go to the Depths to find her
anything that shows another such figure. He
wants you there to take a picture of it with the
Purah Pad's {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}}, if necessary. Join him at
the chasm south of Lookout Landing.

You found Robbie inside the chasm, down in
the Depths. He unlocked your {{color id="0"}}camera{{color id="-1"}} and 
asked you to give it a try, by taking a {{color id="0"}}picture{{color id="-1"}}
of a nearby statue. 

The statue seems to be very similar to the
{{color id="0"}}figure{{color id="-1"}} on the slate fragment that Josha
is studying.

You took a picture of the statue, and Robbie
said it captured the mysterious figure well.

Head to Lookout Landing and show the picture
to Josha.

label: Complete

You returned to Lookout Landing with your
picture of the statue. Josha said you'd made
a big discovery that could lead to truly
understanding what the Depths are.

She's going to search through what others have
found in the Depths, hoping to find more slate
fragments with these mysterious people.
