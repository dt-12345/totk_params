The King Gleeok sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

Now he wants to give you a reward for all your

The King Gleeok sculpture was placed on the
stage, and Kilton treated the villagers to a
presentation about the monster.

It's been a dream of Kilton's to teach folks
about monsters and help them see that they
have good traits too. He's thrilled to be on
his way toward making that dream a reality.
