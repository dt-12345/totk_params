Tulin of Rito Village

---
label: MountainHut
---
A severe blizzard has struck Rito Village, leaving
it in crisis. Teba had no information for you
concerning Princess Zelda, but he suggested
you ask Harth{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}at a nearby lodge.

This lodge is north of the village at the foot of
the Hebra Mountains, and it's marked by a
{{color id="0"}}pair of bonfires{{color id="-1"}}.

---
label: GoToCave
---
Harth had no leads on Princess Zelda either.
He suggested you speak to Tulin, who has been
scouting the skies since the fierce blizzard
began.

Harth said that Tulin went to the {{color id="0"}}Hebra South
Summit Cave{{color id="-1"}} with Gesane and Laissa. Its
entrance is marked with another bonfire.

label: FoundTulin
---
Upon reaching the lone cedar tree, you found
an upset Tulin looking toward the sky.

He said his bow was stolen by a flying monster.

---
label: IpponSugi
---
Tulin was not at the cave when you went out
to find him. Gesane told you that he left Hebra
South Summit Cave and went toward the {{color id="0"}}lone
cedar tree{{color id="-1"}} on {{color id="0"}}Talonto Peak{{color id="-1"}}, visible to the north.

According to Gesane, he saw a group of
monsters and gave chase alone.

---
label: GetBack
---
Upon reaching the lone cedar tree, you found
an upset Tulin. He told you that a flying monster
stole his bow.

It's up to you to defeat the monster and get
{{color id="0"}}Tulin's bow{{color id="-1"}} back.

---
label: DefeatEnemy
---
You defeated the Aerocuda and recovered
Tulin's bow. But before the two of you could
leave, more Aerocudas arrived—this time
flinging Bokoblins at you.

Work with Tulin to defeat the monsters.

---
label: GoToHebra
---
Tulin's recent ordeal has taught him a valuable
lesson about working together. Even Harth can
see that the young Rito has matured.

Go with Tulin to the {{color id="0"}}sky islands{{color id="-1"}} above Hebra
Peak, where he claims he saw Princess Zelda.

---
label: GoDungeon
---
Though you didn't find Princess Zelda where
Tulin said she'd be, you heard a disembodied
voice say, "Come to me." Inside the cloud, you
discovered a great ship, which looks just like
the one from the Song of the Stormwind Ark.

Is this mysterious voice guiding Tulin {{color id="0"}}into
the cloud{{color id="-1"}}?

---
label: CheckTerminal
---
You found a massive ship, which Tulin says
is the Stormwind Ark, floating inside the
thunderhead. A figure greatly resembling
Princess Zelda was seen on the ship's deck
before she vanished suddenly. The blizzard,
which shows no sign of abating, is coming from
{{color id="0"}}below the hatch{{color id="-1"}}. The cause of the Rito's
suffering seems close at hand.

---
label: DungeonStart
---
You tried using the terminal, but the deck's
hatch did not open. The mysterious voice then
spoke to you again, saying the hatch will remain
shut until all five locks are unlocked.

Find the {{color id="0"}}five locks{{color id="-1"}} the voice spoke of to save
Rito Village from the never-ending blizzard and
to get a lead on Princess Zelda's whereabouts.

---
label: BossBattle
---
You unlocked the five locks. Once you {{color id="0"}}use the
terminal{{color id="-1"}} and open the deck hatch, it will be time
to step forward and stop the frigid winds
spouting from belowdecks.

---
label: DefeatBoss
---
When the deck hatch opened, a {{color id="0"}}massive
monster {{color id="-1"}}emerged. This must be the culprit
behind the fierce blizzard assailing Rito Village.

Work with Tulin to vanquish the monster.

---
label: TouchSecretStone
---
The ice covering the altar melted after you
vanquished the monster, revealing a {{color id="0"}}shining
stone{{color id="-1"}} set there.

You can sense great power emanating from
the stone, and Tulin senses it as well.

---
label: Complete
---
Rito Village is no longer at the mercy of the
unusual blizzard.

Tulin, who inherited a secret stone from the
ancient sage to become the new Sage{{color id="0"}} {{color id="-1"}}of Wind,
promised to lend you his power anytime.
