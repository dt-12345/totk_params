Domidak and Prissen are scheming to grab a
treasure chest surrounded by a bottomless bog
of certain doom.

They're struggling and have complained there's
nowhere to {{color id="0"}}put their feet{{color id="-1"}}.

Domidak and Prissen were pained to learn the
treasure was already taken. They plan to
console themselves by searching some {{color id="0"}}caves{{color id="-1"}}
for Misko's treasure.

Famous for both banditry and fashion, Misko
hid their collection of clothes all around Hyrule.
