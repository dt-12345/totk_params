White Goats Gone Missing

---

It seems that all of the {{color id="0"}}white goats {{color id="-1"}}kept in
Tabantha Bridge Stable have run off together.
According to Penn, these events may somehow
connect to Princess Zelda.

You may learn more by speaking with the
stable hand, {{color id="0"}}Chork{{color id="-1"}}, who is responsible for
the white goats.

According to Chork, the white goats ran off
after they were given a special feed made from
a recipe Princess Zelda created. The only thing
left behind when they fled were uneaten {{color id="0"}}Hylian
pine cones{{color id="-1"}}.

Did the goats really run off because of the food
they were given? Where did they run off to?

You've found the white goats that went missing.
Chork is incredibly remorseful for having messed
up the animal-feed recipe, and even more
remorseful for having doubted Princess Zelda's
recipe in the first place. After you told Penn
what happened, he returned to the newspaper
to write up an article about the events.
