Robbie says that he can equip your Purah Pad
with a sensor that can detect specific things.
He wants you to come to the Purah Pad
Research Lab near Hateno Village.

You'll find it at the edge of the East Necluda
region in southeast Hyrule. There he'll set up
the sensor to detect shrines.

Robbie installed the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}}, which can detect
shrines. It uses sound to guide you to shrines
and will respond more strongly {{color id="0"}}when you move
in the direction of the shrine{{color id="-1"}}.

Find the shrine down the slope right outside the
lab, in the direction the {{color id="0"}}sensor{{color id="-1"}} is pointing you.

label: Report
