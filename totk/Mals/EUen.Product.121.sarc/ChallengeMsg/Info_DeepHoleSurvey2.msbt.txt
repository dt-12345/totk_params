A Mystery in the Depths

---
label: AfterInterview

Josha is looking for help to investigate the
Depths due to a new discovery. She said
you've come at a perfect time and has
selected you to help her.

Go with Josha to hear more about the
upcoming investigation.

---
label: Step01
---
Josha pieced together a large mural from
fragments to complete a picture that might
show a series of statues in the Depths.

Each one looks toward the next, until the last
gazes at a {{color id="0"}}temple-like building {{color id="-1"}}that's the focal
point of the mural. Josha thinks this place may
be real and hold a special Zonai power.

Just as Josha thought, when you went where
each statue was looking in the Depths, you
found your way to a temple-like building. There
you acquired the Zonai ability Autobuild.

Report your discovery to Josha at
Lookout Landing.

label: Buield
---
When you shared Autobuild with Josha, she
expressed that she wants to see the power
in action.

She asked you to use {{color id="0"}}Autobuild{{color id="-1"}} to repair
the broken balloon at Lookout Landing.

label: Complete

With the help of Autobuild, you fixed the
broken balloon. Both Josha and Robbie were
impressed. The results of this investigation
reaffirmed the importance of the Depths to
Josha. She has asked you to let her know if you
make any new discoveries in the Depths.
