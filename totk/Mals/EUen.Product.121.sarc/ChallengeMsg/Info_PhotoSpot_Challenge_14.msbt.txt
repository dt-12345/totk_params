A Picture for Snowfield Stable

---
label: Step01
---
Varke, the owner of Snowfield Stable, wants to
hang up a painting of "the giant bird with wings
stretched wide" in the Hebra Mountains.
It's said this bird can be seen when looking
northwest from the {{color id="0"}}lone cedar tree on Talonto
Peak{{color id="-1"}} when it isn't snowing. Maybe there's a
way to take a picture of it and show it to Varke.

Varke, owner of Snowfield Stable, is pleased to
have hung up a painting of "the giant bird with
wings stretched wide," which can be seen in
the Hebra Mountains when it's not snowing.

He was going to give you a reward, but your
inventory was full. Be sure to trim your
belongings before you accept his gift.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different
picture of the same scenery. Just show him a
new image and he'll make a copy to display.
