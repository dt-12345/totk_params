cabin. Apparently, they're concerned about the
monsters outside and are hesitant to open up
the door.

It seems like the door will stay closed {{color id="0"}}as long
as they can hear the monsters{{color id="-1"}}.

a cabin. They were troubled by the sounds of
surrounding monsters and didn't want to open

Jogo and Yammo inside the cabin say they want
to give you some spicy elixir as thanks for
defeating the monsters outside the cabin, but
you couldn't take the reward because your

Inside a cabin were a couple of travelers, Jogo
and Yammo. They were on their way to see a
legendary shield surfer but were waylaid by
monsters. For defeating the monsters, they
rewarded you with a spicy elixir.

They will also give you a shield for shield surfing
as a reward for helping them.
