Decorate with Passion

label: Step1
---
Boraa was asked by her mentor to decorate a
weapon, but she was stumped by the specific
request to make it sparkle and radiate burning
passion. She's also unable to use monster
parts in the task.

Perhaps she would benefit from seeing a
{{color id="0"}}weapon to use as a reference{{color id="-1"}}?

Boraa was troubled by a mentor's request.
She was unsure how to go about decorating a
weapon, but once you showed her a weapon
that sparkled and radiated burning passion, her
worries subsided.

Make some space in your pouch, then accept
the reward for your efforts.
