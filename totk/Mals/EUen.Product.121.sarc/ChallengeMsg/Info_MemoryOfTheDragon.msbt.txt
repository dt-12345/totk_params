The Dragon's Tears

label: GoTemple

You found one of the mysterious Dragon's
Tears within a geoglyph and received a vision
about {{color id="0"}}Princess Zelda{{color id="-1"}} by investigating it.

Impa thinks that the mystery of the geoglyphs
might connect to something that's inside the
Forgotten Temple. It's located somewhere
along the {{color id="0"}}bottom of a canyon in Hebra{{color id="-1"}}.

You saw Cado at the entrance to the Forgotten
Temple. He said that he's come here with Impa
to find {{color id="0"}}something inside that's connected to
the geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}}. She's apparently gone deeper
into the temple.

See what you can discover in this mysterious
place.

Inside the Forgotten Temple is a map of Hyrule
and 11 murals related to the geoglyphs.
It seems that these geoglyphs appeared in
various places after the Upheaval when
Princess Zelda went missing.

You have {{color id="0"}}{{number14 ref="Residue_MemoryOfTheDragon" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{pluralCase arg1="geoglyph" arg2="geoglyphs" arg3=""}} {{color id="-1"}}left to investigate.

You visited all 11 geoglyphs and witnessed all
the memories in the Dragon's Tears. Afterward,
a Light Dragon appeared above you and shed a
new tear.

The tear seems to have fallen to the {{color id="0"}}Rist
Peninsula {{color id="-1"}}in the {{color id="0"}}Akkala {{color id="-1"}}region.

You visited all the geoglyphs and witnessed all
the memories in the Dragon's Tears. These
visions showed you Princess Zelda sacrificing
herself, becoming the Light Dragon, and hoping
to eventually entrust the Master Sword to you.
You must honor the princess's wish, somehow.
