The Purah Pad has a function called {{color id="0"}}sensor +{{color id="-1"}}
that allows you to pinpoint the location of
things registered in your Hyrule Compendium.
However, upgrading requires {{color id="0"}}data from five
types of monsters{{color id="-1"}}.

Have Robbie make the modification once
you've collected all the data.
