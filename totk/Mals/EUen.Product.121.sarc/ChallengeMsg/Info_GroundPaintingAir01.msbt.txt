Cado told you that Impa is traveling Hyrule to
see the so-called {{color id="0"}}geoglyphs{{color id="-1"}} that have
appeared across the land. He said she's at
New Serenne Stable and that he's going there
to join her.

If you meet her there, you may be able to get a
{{color id="0"}}clue about Princess Zelda's whereabouts{{color id="-1"}}.

You saw Cado at New Serenne Stable and
told him about your search for Princess Zelda.
He said you should meet with Impa, who is
at some ruins very close by.

She may have {{color id="0"}}information about Princess
Zelda's whereabouts{{color id="-1"}}.

Impa was investigating a geoglyph near New
Serenne Stable. She's frustrated because
it's impossible to see the full picture from
the ground.

If you fix the broken balloon she told you about,
she might be able to get a bird's-eye view.

label: Search
---
You hitched a ride on the balloon and saw the
whole geoglyph from the air. According to Impa,
hidden somewhere in the geoglyph is something
called a {{color id="0"}}Dragon's Tear{{color id="-1"}}.

Search the most likely spot to find it.

You found a pool in a geoglyph that was likely
one of the Dragon's Tears. Upon touching it,
you had a strange vision about Princess Zelda.

Impa believes that the Dragon's Tears are
connected to the princess in some way. Go in
search of every geoglyph to find more clues
about what's happened to her.
