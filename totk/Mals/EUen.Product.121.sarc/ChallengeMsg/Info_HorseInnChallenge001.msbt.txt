Zumi is hoping to repair a busted wagon, but
she doesn't have {{color id="0"}}wheels {{color id="-1"}}she can attach to it or
a {{color id="0"}}horse {{color id="-1"}}to pull it.

There are building materials at the stable and
some wild horses in the area, but if she's going
to finish this project, she'll need a helping hand.

Zumi's dream of a horse-drawn wagon once
looked hopeless—she didn't have wheels, or
even a horse. But you repaired the wheels and
caught a horse, resulting in a horse-drawn
wagon she can feel proud to own.

This wagon she dubbed "Zunk," a combination
of your name and hers.
