The Closed Door

When you tried to open the door to the
Temple of Time, {{color id="0"}}Rauru{{color id="-1"}} appeared and said
he was the original owner of your new arm.

He also said you need to revitalize the arm so
the power of its touch will open the door. To
do that, visit the island's {{color id="0"}}shrines{{color id="-1"}}. A green light
spirals above each of them.

Rauru appeared after you visited the three
shrines. He said that you've revitalized
enough power in your new arm to enter the
{{color id="0"}}Temple of Time{{color id="-1"}}.

The door will now open at the touch of
your hand.

After visiting the three shrines, you returned to
the Temple of Time. Its door opened to
your touch, no longer denying you entry.
Somehow, your new arm was truly revitalized
enough in those shrines.
