Master the Vehicle Prototype

Fernison from the Zonai Survey Team, with help
from Hudson Construction, has been turning
Zonai devices into vehicle prototypes. She has
one all ready to go...except for one problem:
No one knows {{color id="0"}}how to control it{{color id="-1"}}. None of the
Zonai devices that fell on Tarrey Town seem to
do the trick. So Fernison has called on a couple
of professional racers, hoping they might help.

You've been asked to take the vehicle
prototype for a test drive and to use the
steering stick to control it. You'll have to
touch all of the lights and return to the starting
point within the time limit you were given.
Remember, you'll be disqualified if you {{color id="0"}}take
your hands off the Zonai device or leave the
course{{color id="-1"}}.

You did it! You drove the course and returned
to the starting point within the time limit!

Fernison from the Zonai Survey Team says this
is just the beginning. She seems to have big
plans in the works!
