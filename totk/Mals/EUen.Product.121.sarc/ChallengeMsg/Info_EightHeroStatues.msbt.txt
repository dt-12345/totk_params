The Heroines' Secret

label: Step1

A Gerudo archaeologist named Rotana told you
that there are stelae hidden in the shelter with
information about the seven Gerudo heroines,
and that she would like to see pictures of their
contents. Only by finding all of the stelae can
you piece together the heroines' secret.

You must still find {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="Num_EightHeroStatues" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}{{pluralCase arg1="stela" arg2="stelae" arg3=""}}.

You found all of the stelae and shared the
information with Rotana. She spoke of a place
deep in the shelter where statues of the
heroines can be found. By placing orbs in the
statues' arms, you may help solve the true
mystery of the heroines.

You are apparently free to use Rotana's orb.
