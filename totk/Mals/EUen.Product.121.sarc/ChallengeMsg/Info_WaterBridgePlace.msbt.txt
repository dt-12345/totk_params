"Stand upon the land of the sky fish, and
behold its lofty view. Among the floating rocks
you see, a droplet waits for you. Through this
droplet shoot an arrow with the mark of the

When you shot the mark of the king into the
droplet visible from the land of the sky fish, a
pillar of light appeared in the reservoir in the
eastern part of the domain.

If the writing on the ancient stone slate is
correct, this should indicate the hiding place
of the watery bridge.
