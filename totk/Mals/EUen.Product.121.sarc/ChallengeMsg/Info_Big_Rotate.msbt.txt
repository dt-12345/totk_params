One of Kula's friends said they saw a {{color id="0"}}big swirly
circle{{color id="-1"}} in the water.

Kula can't go looking himself but said that
he would like to see that swirly thing.

You showed Kula the whirly circle. Now he
wants to see a {{color id="0"}}big circle of swirly sand{{color id="-1"}}.

Kula would probably be happy if you found it
and brought it to him.
