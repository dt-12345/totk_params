The Flute Player's Plan

label: step1

Pyper tried to make the glowing tree of
Haite's dreams by lighting it on fire, but his
efforts turned to ash. Now he's fired up to
try again using fireflies.

He needs {{color id="0"}}10 sunset fireflies{{color id="-1"}} for his
next attempt.

You gave Pyper 10 sunset fireflies.

In order to show off his glowing tree, Pyper
wants you to {{color id="0"}}bring Haite to the tree at night{{color id="-1"}}.

Accompanied by the flute, the fireflies lit up the
darkness and made the tree glow spectacularly.
Haite felt a swell of emotion and could not hold
back a true smile. Inspired, Pyper vowed to
return to the Stable Trotters to hone his craft
and use his music to keep Haite smiling.

Pyper would like to give you a thank-you gift.
