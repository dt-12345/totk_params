Kilton wants Hudson to make a Horriblin
sculpture for him, but he's finding it difficult to
describe what a Horriblin looks like.

Hudson explained that he'd have no problem
making the sculpture if he had a {{color id="0"}}detailed picture{{color id="-1"}}
of the monster to look at for reference.

You showed Hudson a picture of a Horriblin,
and he made a sculpture of it. Now Kilton
wants the sculpture moved to a stage.

Let Kilton know once you have {{color id="0"}}placed it on
the stage{{color id="-1"}}.

Kilton called the villagers together to show
off the Horriblin sculpture and then treated
everyone to a presentation about the monster.

Now he wants to give you a reward for all your
help. Be sure to make room for Kilton's present
among your belongings, and then go see him.

Hudson was so happy with how the project
turned out, he wants to make more sculptures.
If you bring him a {{color id="0"}}picture of a monster{{color id="-1"}}, he's
likely to use it as reference for a sculpture.
