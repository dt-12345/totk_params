A group of fellows in their underpants have 
settled in at Foothill Stable. Penn says they're
on the Zonai Survey Team, and they're wearing
only underpants by order of Princess Zelda,
which sounds odd all around to him. He's
also concerned that some of them left to
investigate a {{color id="0"}}monster den{{color id="-1"}} on the nearby
mountain road—and have not yet returned.

You found members of the Zonai Survey Team
at the entrance to the Foothill Monster Den
wearing only their underpants. They said they
couldn't defeat the monsters inside, dressed
like that. You agreed to show them how it's
done, so you will need to {{color id="0"}}defeat the monsters
in the cave wearing only your underpants{{color id="-1"}}.

You lived up to the promise you made to the
Zonai Survey Team members outside the
Foothill Monster Den and defeated all of the
monsters while wearing only your underpants.

Report back to them at the cave's entrance.

You defeated the cave monsters wearing only
your underpants and reported back to the
Zonai Survey Team members at the entrance.

They've asked you to return to {{color id="0"}}Foothill Stable{{color id="-1"}},
where they plan on telling everyone there
about your great accomplishment.

When you returned to Foothill Stable and 
talked to the Zonai Survey Team, you learned
that Princess Zelda's orders weren't to "explore
in underpants," but instead "explore all other
paths." Penn said he'd write up the whole
story, and then he left.
