Lurelin Village Restoration Project

The monsters that took over Lurelin Village
left destroyed homes in their wake. The
buildings will have to be repaired before the
villagers can return home, and that will take
lots of {{color id="0"}}logs {{color id="-1"}}and {{color id="0"}}Hylian rice{{color id="-1"}}.

Help rebuild Lurelin Village.
