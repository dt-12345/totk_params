The general store is at risk of running out of

in the hills west of the village.

Trissa is worried about the pair but can't leave
the store to check on them.

Steen and Olkin went to drive monsters out of
the Ring Ruin in the hills west of the village.

You defeated all the monsters in the Ring Ruin
in the hills west of the village.

By defeating the monsters in the Ring Ruin
in the hills west of the village, you showed
Steen and Olkin that both offensive and
defensive fighting methods are important.

Trissa has been waiting for them to return.
Report back to her.

Steen and Olkin, who stock the general store,
are back home at their village and seem to have
resolved their differences.

Trissa was beyond happy to see that the two
are getting along. She gave you an endura
carrot as thanks.
