To celebrate you becoming a teacher, Uma will
grow something you like. Your choice is limited

Uma grew something for you in her garden to
celebrate you becoming a professor. She was
very pleased with the first harvest. You're free
to use the garden's bounty as you please.
If you talk to Uma again, she can plant
something else there instead.
