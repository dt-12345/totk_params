The Incomplete Stable

Lester, the horse guard, is at a loss because
he can't take horses until the stable is ready.

Karson has been trying to build a stable, but he
is struggling to figure out {{color id="0"}}how to fit{{color id="-1"}} the final
roof plank.

Delighted by the roof's completion, Karson
finished the stable with incredible skill. Now
you can board horses at Lookout Landing.

Talk to Lester if you have any
horse-related business.
