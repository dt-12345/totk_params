Stone slabs have been found in the Ring Ruins
that fell around Kakariko Village. Bugut has
come to see the writing on the slabs but is
afraid of heights and can't visit the ruins.

If you read what's written on each slab, let him
know what they say. You have {{color id="0"}}{{number2 ref="NumOfNotToldPlates" otherArg="0xFFFF00CD"}} {{color id="-1"}}more to
tell him about.

You told Bugut about what you read on the
stone slabs in each of the four non-floating
Ring Ruins. He was delighted to get these
insights into the ancient era the ruins
came from.
