Sayge at Kochi Dye Shop has started using his
dyeing technique to make different fabrics.
He wants to make one based on a {{color id="0"}}Chuchu{{color id="-1"}} and
has asked you for a visual reference.

If he could get a good look at a common, blue
Chuchu, he could come up with a lovely design.

Sayge was struck by inspiration upon seeing
your Chuchu picture and was able to finalize
his fabric.

If you take any other {{color id="0"}}pictures{{color id="-1"}} that could serve
as reference for the {{color id="0"}}fabrics Sayge wants to
make{{color id="-1"}}, be sure to show them to him.
