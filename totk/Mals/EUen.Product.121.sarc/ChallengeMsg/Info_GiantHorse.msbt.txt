Ride the Giant Horse

label: Step1
---
You ran into Baddek, a horse-lover who found
a beautiful crystal in the mountains southwest
of the Faron Grasslands. Baddek said he'll give
the crystal to you if you bring him the {{color id="0"}}giant
horse{{color id="-1"}} that's rumored to be in the area.

Ask near Highland Stable east of the grasslands
to see if anyone knows about this giant horse.

Impressed with the giant horse, Baddek gave
you the {{color id="0"}}crystal{{color id="-1"}}, which emits a faint light.

The next step is to figure out what the crystal
might be used for.

label: Step3

Baddek gave you a crystal after you brought
him the giant horse. It seems that you can enter
a Shrine of Light if you offer up a crystal.

Follow the ray of light, and offer up the crystal
at the shrine.

You brought the giant horse to Baddek, and he
gave you a crystal in return. You offered up the
crystal and can now enter the Shrine of Light.
