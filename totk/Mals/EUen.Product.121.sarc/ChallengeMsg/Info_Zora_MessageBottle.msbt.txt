Kodah at the inn came across the following
passage from an ancient text: "{{color id="0"}}Long, long ago,
at Tarm Point, a blessed stone was hidden
away within a sacred shrine.{{color id="-1"}}"

Kodah's daughter, Finley, believes there must
be treasure there, and so she and Sasan set off
for Tarm Point. Does treasure await them?

You found Sasan when you entered the cave
at Tarm Point. It seems Finley ventured deeper
into the cave without waiting for him.

Sasan needs to board a {{color id="0"}}raft {{color id="-1"}}to catch up to her,
but he can't make it far with the water level
rising and falling. He's not sure what to do...

You let Sasan board the raft in the cave at
Tarm Point and delivered him safely to Finley,
who was waiting for him farther inside.

They want to give you a gift in thanks. Call on
them again after you {{color id="0"}}organize your belongings{{color id="-1"}}.

You let Sasan board the raft in the cave at
Tarm Point and delivered him safely to Finley,
who was waiting for him farther inside.

They didn't find the treasure they expected at
the Shrine deep within the cave, but in the end,
the memories they made together are more
precious a treasure than any.
