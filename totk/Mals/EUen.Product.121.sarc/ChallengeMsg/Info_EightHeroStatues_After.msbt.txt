The Mysterious Eighth

label: Step1

Rotana has stayed behind to restore the spirits
as described on the stelae. She believes the
orb she gave you is one of these spirits, but
she doesn't know where to find any of the
other orbs.

According to the stela, returning the spirits to
the seven heroine statues will reveal the eighth.

Returning the spirits to the seven heroines'
statues opened a path to a hidden room.

You should inspect the room for any signs of
the true history.

label: Step2

Inside the hidden room was a giant orb, which
is the key to a sanctuary. According to Rotana,
the Gerudo have an underground sanctuary
beneath the North Gerudo Ruins.

She asked you to {{color id="0"}}carry the giant orb to the
entrance of the sanctuary{{color id="-1"}}.

Setting the giant orb into the entrance to the
underground chamber beneath the North
Gerudo Ruins opened a locked door and
revealed the path to the sanctuary. Is the
secret of the eighth hidden somewhere within?

label: Step4

You discovered a stela deep within the
sanctuary. Apparently, the eighth hero was
a Hylian voe who saved Gerudo Town long ago.

Return to Gerudo Town and let Rotana know
of your findings.

You told Rotana about what you read on the
stela deep within the sanctuary. She was
excited to learn the truth about the eighth hero
after so many years of it being shrouded in
mystery. She insisted on listing you as a
co-author in the full expedition report.
