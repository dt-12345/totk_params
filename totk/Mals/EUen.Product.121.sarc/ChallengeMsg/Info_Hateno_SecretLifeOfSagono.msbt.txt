Cece's Secret

---
label: Step01
---
It seems that Cece sneaks out of her house
somewhere {{color id="0"}}every night{{color id="-1"}}. Sophie has asked you
to tail Cece.

It sounds like she's alert to her surroundings
while she's moving, so it'll be important to
stay out of sight.

---
label: Step02
---
You tailed Cece late at night and observed her
eating vegetables alone in a silo. From what
you overheard, she has a deep love for
Hateno Village's produce.

Sophie should hear about this.

Having learned that all Cece was doing at night
was eating vegetables in secret, Sophie was
very relieved.
