A Picture for Wetland Stable

label: Step01

Lawdon, the owner of Wetland Stable, wants to
hang up a big painting of the Ring Ruins—one
that {{color id="0"}}shows the ring shape of the ruins clearly{{color id="-1"}}.
He says they can be found in Kakariko Village
to the southeast.

Maybe there's a way to show a picture of the
ruins to Lawdon.

Lawdon, the owner of Wetland Stable, is

hanging on the wall of his establishment.

He wants to give you a reward, but your

Lawdon, the owner of Wetland Stable, is
pleased to have a painting of the Ring Ruins
hanging on the wall of his establishment.

Still, he's happy to replace it with a different
picture of the ruins. Just show him a new image
and he'll make a copy to put on display.
