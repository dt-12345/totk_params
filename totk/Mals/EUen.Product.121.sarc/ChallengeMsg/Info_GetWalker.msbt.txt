Presenting: Hero's Path Mode!

label: Step01

Apparently the Purah Pad has a feature called
{{color id="0"}}hero's path mode{{color id="-1"}} that allows you to review
where you've been. However, calibrating the
upgrade will require {{color id="0"}}data from 15 shrine
locations{{color id="-1"}}.

Have Robbie make the modifications once you
have the data.

You gave Robbie data on 15 shrine locations,
and he successfully updated the Purah Pad.

Now you can use the hero's path mode to see
where you've been on the map.
