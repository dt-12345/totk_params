Cold-Endurance Contest!

Rahdo has challenged you to a contest of
endurance. To win, you must stand atop a pillar
through the cold of the night in nothing but
your underwear.

So long as you do not touch the ground, you're
allowed to do whatever it takes to endure.

cold-endurance contest.

However, Rahdo refused to take your victory
lying down and immediately challenged you to
a heat-endurance contest.
