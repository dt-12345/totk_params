You ran into {{color id="0"}}Master Kohga{{color id="-1"}}, head of the Yiga
Clan, in the Great Abandoned Central Mine in
the Depths. He's dead set on getting his hands
on the power of the Zonai and bringing about
the end of the world with the {{color id="0"}}Magnificent One{{color id="-1"}}.
Could this have something to do with Zelda's
disappearance? Master Kohga's next stop is
the {{color id="0"}}Southwestern Abandoned Mine{{color id="-1"}}...

You faced {{color id="0"}}Master Kohga{{color id="-1"}}, head of the Yiga Clan,
in the Great Abandoned Central Mine. He plans
to use the power of the Zonai to end the world
with the {{color id="0"}}Magnificent One{{color id="-1"}}. Could they be
involved with Zelda's disappearance? Kohga
went to the {{color id="0"}}Abandoned Gerudo Mine{{color id="-1"}}. You can
go there by following a nearby series of
statues through the Depths.

label: Again

You successfully drove Master Kohga from the
Abandoned Gerudo Mine, and learned his true
aim. He plans to restore a powerful weapon for
"{{color id="0"}}the man himself{{color id="-1"}}." Pursue Kohga to the
{{color id="0"}}Abandoned Lanayru Mine{{color id="-1"}}. A line of statues
stretching from one of the chasms either in {{color id="0"}}the
Lanayru Wetlands {{color id="-1"}}or{{color id="0"}} amidst the mountains
south of there {{color id="-1"}}will guide you to the mine.

You encountered Master Kohga a third time and
chased him from the Abandoned Lanayru Mine.
As he fled, he told you that he knows where the
{{color id="0"}}Demon King{{color id="-1"}} is and plans to activate an
"{{color id="0"}}ultimate weapon{{color id="-1"}}." The Demon King may have
a clue to Zelda's whereabouts, so go catch
Kohga at the {{color id="0"}}Abandoned Hebra Mine{{color id="-1"}}. There
may be a chasm that leads you straight to it...

Your final showdown with Master Kohga at the
Abandoned Hebra Mine resulted in the revival
of the ultimate weapon—a giant construct.
You managed to defeat it, and Master Kohga
was last seen blasted skyward by his own hand,
his plot foiled. Though Zelda's whereabouts
remain unknown, you learned that the Demon
King lurks beneath Hyrule Castle...
