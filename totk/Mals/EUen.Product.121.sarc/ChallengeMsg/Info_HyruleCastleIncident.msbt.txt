Crisis at Hyrule Castle

---
label: CastleSurvey
---
Hyrule Castle rose into the air at the start of
the Upheaval, which tore apart the earth
underneath it.

Purah believes that Princess Zelda may have
called out to you from deep in the earth.

When you joined the search party, you found
Princess Zelda—but she transformed into light
and disappeared.

Return to Lookout Landing, and report this
to Purah and the others.

---
label: GoToCannon
---
After you told Purah that Princess Zelda
vanished, she asked you to search the regions
of Hyrule where the Upheaval is also wreaking
havoc. Purah wants to mark those spots on
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}, but you'll first {{color id="0"}}need some map data{{color id="-1"}}.

Meet Purah at the Skyview Tower to begin
this process.

After you told Purah that Princess Zelda
vanished into light at Hyrule Castle, she asked
you to redirect your search into the regions of
Hyrule, where the Upheaval is also wreaking
havoc. Purah wants to mark those spots on
your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}, but you'll first {{color id="0"}}need some map data{{color id="-1"}}.
Hold the Purah Pad near the Skyview Tower's
terminal to do this.

You've discovered that a Skyview Tower will
launch you high into the sky, where you also
scan the nearby terrain from the air. The {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}
data is added to your Purah Pad.

Purah wanted to give you some potential
destinations to investigate. Report back to  
her at the research lab in Lookout Landing.

Where Princess Zelda is remains a mystery.
Purah said you might learn more by looking into
the major phenomena that are troubling some
regions. She's marked them on your {{color id="0"}}map{{color id="-1"}}.

Hyrule Castle remains strangely in the sky,
though you saw someone who looked like the
princess leave it, vanishing into light.

Princess Zelda suddenly appeared at the
floating Hyrule Castle alongside a red moon.

Much is still unclear, but you should go to
Hyrule Castle to check things out.

---
label: DefeatBlackZelda
---
You infiltrated Hyrule Castle and finally arrived
at Princess Zelda's location.

But the princess was an impostor—a duplicate
created by the mummy. The impostor further
warped its appearance and began attacking.

---
label: ReturnBCAfterBlackZelda
---
Princess Zelda, who appeared at Hyrule Castle,
turned out to be an impostor created by
Demon King Ganondorf.

The Demon King isn't yet fully regenerated, so
there may still be time. Return to Lookout
Landing and talk to Purah.

---
label: UnderFindTheFifthSage
---
You told Purah about the impostor princess
and how Demon King Ganondorf is trying to
rise again.

Hyrule Castle remains a devastated place
and continues to float above the ground.

---
label: Complete
---
The phenomena at Hyrule Castle and the
Upheaval were all due to Demon King
Ganondorf, who is trying to destroy
the world.

Combine your powers with the five sages and
slay the Demon King.
