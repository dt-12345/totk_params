Serenade to Mija

The Great Fairy Mija is hiding in her flower bud,
found in the foothills of a mountain near
Snowfield Stable. Horn music might draw her
out, but the horn player Eustus is missing.

A traveler who'd come from the south reported
hearing the {{color id="0"}}sound of a horn{{color id="-1"}} along the road in
the area around Tabantha Great Bridge.

It's said that the Great Fairy Mija, who lives on
the lower slope of a mountain near Snowfield
Stable, won't come out of her bud. Eustus,
the Stable Trotters member that Mastro was
searching for, has safely returned to the troupe.

Go talk to {{color id="0"}}Mastro at Snowfield Stable{{color id="-1"}}.

It's said that the Great Fairy who lives on the
lower slope of a mountain near Snowfield Stable
won't come out of her bud. Mastro thinks the
Stable Trotters' horn music will bring her out.

They'd like to go to her, but their {{color id="0"}}wagon has no
roof{{color id="-1"}}, so he's worried the band will catch cold in
the snow. For now, they're stuck at the stable.

The Stable Trotters' performance inspired the
Great Fairy to leave her bud. The horn player,
Eustus, was moved that she enjoyed his
music. Mastro gave you a silver rupee as a
thank-you for helping his troupe.
